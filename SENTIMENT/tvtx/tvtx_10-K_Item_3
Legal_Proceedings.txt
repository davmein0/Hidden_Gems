CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K of Travere Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”) include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The statements herein which are not historical reflect our current expectations and projections about the Company’s future results, performance, liquidity, financial condition, prospects and opportunities and are based upon information currently available to the Company's management and is subject to its interpretation of what are believed to be significant factors affecting the Company's business, including many assumptions regarding future events.

expectations regarding our pivotal Phase 3 HARMONY Study to support the potential approval of pegtibatinase for the treatment of classical homocystinuria (HCU), including our ability to restart enrollment in 2026;
•
expectations regarding the potential for sparsentan in 
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (
FSGS) and related matters, including our planned submission of a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for FSGS around the end of the first quarter of 2025;

acquisitions of other companies or assets that we might undertake in the future;
•
our operations in the United States and abroad, and the domestic and foreign regulatory, economic and political conditions; and
•
competition existing today or that will likely arise in the future.
Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words “may,” “should,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “intend,” “seek,” or “project” or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. Actual results, performance, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, prospects and opportunities could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements as a result of various risks, uncertainties and other factors, including the ability to raise sufficient capital to continue the Company’s operations. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, without limitation, the risks outlined under “Risk Factors” and matters described in this Annual Report generally. In addition, statements that "we believe" and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and while we believe such information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. 
In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report will in fact occur. Potential investors should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Except as expressly required by the federal securities laws, there is no undertaking to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or any other reason.

assessment of the business, the industry in which it works and the economy at large and other operational factors, including capital resources and liquidity, financial condition, fulfillment of contracts and opportunities. The actual results may differ significantly from the projections.

Risk Factor Summary
Below is a summary of material factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found under the heading “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC before making investment decisions regarding our common stock.
•
Our future prospects are highly dependent upon our ability to successfully develop and execute commercialization strategies for our products, including FILSPARI, and to attain market acceptance among physicians, patients and healthcare payers. 
•
Our clinical trials are expensive and time-consuming and may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates. 
•
Success in nonclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful.
•
Communications and/or feedback from regulatory authorities related to our current or planned future clinical trials does not guarantee any particular outcome from or timeline for regulatory review, and expedited regulatory review pathways may not actually lead to faster development or approval.
•
In order to operate our business and increase adoption and sales of our products, we need to continue to develop our commercial organization, including maintaining a highly experienced and skilled workforce with qualified sales representatives.
•
Interim, topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish may change materially as more patient data become available and audit and verification procedures are complete.
•
We face substantial generic and other competition, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively. 
•
Healthcare reform initiatives, unfavorable pricing regulations, and changes in reimbursement practices of third-party payers or patients' access to insurance coverage could affect the pricing of and demand for our products.
•
We are dependent on third parties to manufacture and distribute our products.
•
The market opportunities for our products and product candidates may be smaller than we believe they are.
•
Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization.
•
We do not currently have patent protection for certain of our commercial products. If we are unable to obtain and maintain protection for the intellectual property relating to our technology and products, their value will be adversely affected.
•
We expect to rely on orphan drug status to develop and commercialize certain of our products and product candidates, but our orphan drug designations may not confer marketing exclusivity or other expected commercial benefits.
•
If we are unable to obtain and maintain coverage and adequate reimbursement from governments or third-party payers for any products that we may develop or if we are unable to obtain acceptable prices for those products, our prospects for generating revenue and achieving profitability will suffer.
•
We will likely experience fluctuations in operating results and could incur substantial losses. 
•
Negative publicity regarding any of our products could impair our ability to market any such product and may require us to spend time and money to address these issues.
•
We may need substantial funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed.
•
We may not receive some or all of the potential milestone and/or royalty payments from our corporate and licensing transactions.
•
We may be unable to successfully integrate new products or businesses we may acquire.
•
We may become involved in litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs, divert management's attention and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.

We are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight, which may result in significant additional expense and may limit our commercial success.
