 Annual Report on Form 10-K
, which discussion is incorporated by reference herein.
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company headquartered in San Diego, California, focused on identifying, developing and delivering life-changing therapies to people living with rare kidney and metabolic diseases. Our approach centers on advancing our innovative pipeline with multiple late-stage clinical programs targeting rare diseases with significant unmet medical needs. Upon approval of any of our late-stage programs, we intend to leverage the skills of our talented commercial organization which has successfully identified, supported and treated patients prescribed our approved products for over ten years.
FILSPARI® (sparsentan)
On September 5, 2024, the FDA granted full approval of FILSPARI® (sparsentan) to slow kidney function decline in adults with primary Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) who are at risk of disease progression. FILSPARI had previously been granted accelerated approval in February 2023 based on the surrogate marker of proteinuria. Full approval was based on positive long-term confirmatory results from the PROTECT Study demonstrating that FILSPARI significantly slowed kidney function decline over two years compared to irbesartan. 
FILSPARI is the only oral, once-daily, non-immunosuppressive medication that directly targets glomerular injury in the kidney by blocking two critical pathways of IgAN disease progression (endothelin-1 and angiotensin II).
The two-year efficacy data contained in the FDA-approved label is a modified intention to treat (ITT) analysis and evaluates data from all patients regardless of treatment discontinuation. In the final analysis of the 404 randomized patients, FILSPARI significantly reduced the rate of decline in kidney function from baseline to Week 110 compared to irbesartan. In the ITT analysis included in the label, the mean eGFR slope from baseline to Week 110 was -3.0 mL/min/1.73 m
2
/year for FILSPARI and -4.2 mL/min/1.73 m
2
/year for irbesartan, corresponding to a statistically significant treatment effect of 1.2 mL/ min/1.73 m
2
/year (p=0.0168). The positive treatment effects on proteinuria compared to the active control irbesartan that were observed at Week 36 were durable out to the two-year measurement period. Additional results from the PROTECT Study demonstrated the benefit of FILSPARI on absolute eGFR accrued over time and by Week 110 resulted in a 3.8 mL/min/1.73 m
2
 difference in the mean change from baseline between FILSPARI and irbesartan.
Results from the PROTECT Study showed that FILSPARI was well tolerated with a clearly defined safety profile that has been consistent across all clinical trials conducted to date.
FILSPARI is a dual endothelin angiotensin receptor antagonist (DEARA). Pre-clinical data have shown that blockade of both endothelin type A and angiotensin II type 1 pathways in forms of rare chronic kidney disease, reduces proteinuria, protects podocytes and prevents glomerulosclerosis and mesangial cell proliferation. FILSPARI has been granted seven years of Orphan Drug Exclusivity in the U.S. (running from the date of accelerated approval) for the reduction of proteinuria in adults with primary IgAN at risk of rapid disease progression, and has been granted a separate seven years of Orphan Drug Exclusivity in the U.S. (running from the date of full approval) to slow kidney function decline in adults with primary IgAN who are at risk for disease progression, excluding the use provided for in the aforementioned Orphan Drug Exclusivity granted in connection with the accelerated approval.

IgAN is characterized by hematuria, proteinuria, and variable rates of progressive renal failure. With an estimated prevalence of up to 150,000 people in the United States and greater numbers in Europe and Asia, IgAN is the most common primary glomerular disease. Most patients are diagnosed between the ages of 16 and 35, with up to 40% progressing to kidney failure within 15 years. FILSPARI is the first non-immunosuppressive therapy approved for IgAN and is the only oral, once-daily, non-immunosuppressive therapy approved for this condition that directly targets glomerular injury in the kidney by blocking two critical pathways of IgAN disease progression (endothelin-1 and angiotensin II). We estimate more than 70,000 patients in the United States to be addressable under FILSPARI's full approval indication.
Data to support the approval of FILSPARI was generated from the Phase 3 PROTECT Study, the largest head-to-head interventional study to date in IgAN. It is a global, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-arm, active-controlled clinical trial that evaluated the safety and efficacy of 400mg of sparsentan, compared to 300mg of irbesartan, in 404 patients ages 18 years and up with IgAN and persistent proteinuria despite available angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) therapy, and is currently ongoing in the open label extension phase of the study.
FILSPARI is available only through a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) approved by the FDA, regarding mandatory birth control for patients of child-bearing potential regarding risk of embryo-fetal toxicity, as has been required for other approved endothelin antagonists, and a REMS for liver monitoring regarding potential risk of hepatotoxicity, as has been required for certain other approved endothelin antagonists. As part of the liver monitoring REMS, monthly monitoring of each patient is required for the first year the patient is on treatment, and quarterly thereafter. The Company submitted an sNDA for a potential modification to the frequency of liver monitoring for FILSPARI; the sNDA has been accepted for review by the FDA and assigned a PDUFA target action date of August 28, 2025.
In April 2024, we and our partner CSL Vifor announced that the European Commission has granted conditional marketing authorization (“CMA”) for FILSPARI (sparsentan) for the treatment of adults with primary IgAN with a urine protein excretion ≥1.0 g/day (or urine protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥0.75 g/g). The CMA is granted for all member states of the European Union, as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The European Commission's decision follows the positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) in February 2024, based on results from the pivotal Phase 3 PROTECT Study of FILSPARI in IgAN. Under the terms of our license agreement with CSL Vifor, we will be entitled to receive a regulatory milestone payment of $17.5 million upon receipt of full regulatory approval by the European Commission for IgAN, and we anticipate receiving an additional milestone payment upon achievement of market access initiatives in certain countries. CSL Vifor submitted an application for full regulatory approval in the second quarter of 2024. The decision on full regulatory approval, if positive, will convert the CMA to a standard Marketing Authorization (“MA”). FILSPARI became commercially available in Europe under the CMA in August 2024, with an initial launch in Germany and Austria. In October 2024, we and CSL Vifor announced that Swissmedic has granted temporary marketing authorization for FILSPARI for the treatment of adults with primary IgAN with a urine protein excretion ≥1.0 g/day (or urine protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥0.75 g/g). In November 2024, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approved FILSPARI in the United Kingdom.
In January 2024, we announced our entry into an exclusive licensing agreement with Renalys Pharma, Inc. ("Renalys"), to bring sparsentan for the treatment of IgAN to patients in Japan and other countries in Asia. Renalys will hold regional rights to sparsentan for Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Following successful meetings with the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in 2023, in the second quarter of 2024 Renalys initiated an open label registration study of sparsentan in Japan to support potential approval of sparsentan in Japan. In July 2024, Renalys announced that the first patient was dosed in the study, and in January 2025, Renalys announced achievement of full enrollment in the study. Results from the urine protein/creatinine ratio (UP/C) endpoint in the study are expected in the second half of 2025 to support a submission for approval to PMDA. In December 2024, Renalys announced that sparsentan received Orphan Drug Designation from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for the indication of primary IgA nephropathy as of November 27, 2024. Under the terms of the licensing agreement, Renalys will be responsible for development, regulatory matters, and commercialization in the licensed territories.
Clinical-Stage Programs:
Sparsentan for the treatment of FSGS
Sparsentan has been granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of FSGS in the U.S. and the EEA.
FSGS is a leading cause of kidney failure and nephrotic syndrome. There are currently no FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments for FSGS and there remains a high unmet need for patients living with FSGS as off-label treatments such as ACE/ARBs, steroids, and immunosuppressant agents are effective in only a subset of patients and use of some of these off-label treatments may be further inhibited by their safety profiles. Every year approximately 5,400 patients are diagnosed with FSGS and we estimate that there are more than 40,000 FSGS patients in the United States and a similar number in Europe with approximately half of them being candidates for sparsentan. 
In 2016, we generated positive data from our Phase 2 DUET study in FSGS. In 2018, we announced the initiation of the Phase 3 clinical trial designed to serve as the basis for an NDA and MAA filing for sparsentan for the treatment of FSGS (the "DUPLEX Study"). The DUPLEX Study is a global, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-arm, active-controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of sparsentan in 371 patients. The DUPLEX Study protocol provided for an unblinded analysis of at least 190 patients to be performed after 36 weeks of treatment to evaluate the interim efficacy endpoint - the proportion of patients achieving a FSGS partial remission of proteinuria endpoint (FPRE), which is defined 
68
Table of Contents
as urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≤1.5 g/g and a >40% reduction in UPCR from baseline, at week 36. In February 2021, we announced that the ongoing Phase 3 DUPLEX Study achieved its pre-specified interim FSGS partial remission of proteinuria endpoint following the 36-week interim period. After 36 weeks of treatment, 42.0 percent of patients receiving sparsentan achieved FPRE, compared to 26.0 percent of irbesartan-treated patients (p=0.0094). Following engagement with the FDA on the interim proteinuria analysis and a subsequent eGFR data-cut, we elected to forego the previously planned submission for accelerated approval and pursue a potential traditional approval upon completion of the DUPLEX Study. 
In May 2023, we announced topline primary efficacy results from the pivotal Phase 3 DUPLEX Study of sparsentan in FSGS. The confirmatory primary endpoint of the DUPLEX Study designed to support traditional regulatory approval was the rate of change in eGFR over 108 weeks of treatment. At the end of the 108-week double-blind period, sparsentan was observed to have a 0.3 mL/min/1.73m
2
 per year (95% CI: -1.74, 2.41) favorable difference on eGFR total slope and a 0.9 mL/min/1.73m
2 
per year (95% CI: -1.27, 3.04) favorable difference on eGFR chronic slope compared to the active control irbesartan, which was not statistically significant. After 108 weeks of treatment, sparsentan achieved a mean reduction in proteinuria from baseline of 50%, compared to 32% for irbesartan. Although the DUPLEX Study did not achieve its two-year primary endpoint with statistical significance over the active control irbesartan, we are encouraged by the results, including the pre-specified secondary endpoints on proteinuria and exploratory endpoints, including renal outcomes, which trended favorably for sparsentan. In addition, a review of the safety results through 108 weeks of treatment indicate sparsentan was generally well-tolerated and the overall safety profile in the study to date was generally consistent between treatment groups. 
In December 2023, we announced that we completed a planned Type C meeting with the FDA to discuss results from the Phase 3 DUPLEX Study of sparsentan in FSGS. The FDA acknowledged the high unmet need for approved therapies as well as the challenges in studying FSGS but indicated that the two-year results from the Phase 3 DUPLEX Study alone were not sufficient to support an sNDA submission. The FDA acknowledged the work being done by the larger nephrology community to better understand proteinuria and eGFR as endpoints in clinical trials of FSGS and indicated a willingness to continue to engage with us on a potential path forward for sparsentan in FSGS following our consideration of additional evidence. Subsequently, a collaborative international effort referred to as the PARASOL project was initiated with a goal to define the quantitative relationships between short-term changes in biomarkers (proteinuria and GFR) and long-term outcomes in order to support the use of alternative proteinuria-based endpoints as a basis for accelerated and traditional approval. The PARASOL project is led by several patient advocacy organizations focused on glomerular diseases, with participation from regulators and industry representatives. The principal finding from PARASOL was that in FSGS, reduction in proteinuria over 24 months is strongly associated with a reduction in the risk of kidney failure, and responder definitions based on thresholds of proteinuria are both biologically plausible and strongly supported by epidemiological data. Following the recent PARASOL public workshop in which a multi-stakeholder group of rare kidney disease experts aligned around a potential proteinuria-based clinical trial endpoint for FSGS, we scheduled a Type C meeting with the FDA to discuss a potential regulatory pathway for a sparsentan FSGS indication. In February 2025, we announced that we had completed a Type C meeting with the FDA and that we plan to submit an sNDA around the end of the first quarter of 2025 seeking traditional approval of FILSPARI for FSGS. The sNDA will be based on existing data from the Phase 3 DUPLEX and Phase 2 DUET studies of FILSPARI.
Together with CSL Vifor, we also plan to engage with the EMA to determine the potential for a subsequent variation to the Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA) of sparsentan for the treatment of FSGS, if the MAA for full approval of sparsentan in IgA nephropathy is approved. 
Under the terms of our exclusive license to CSL Vifor, CSL Vifor is responsible for all commercialization activities in its licensed territories. We remain responsible for the clinical development of sparsentan in the applicable territories. If sparsentan receives marketing authorization in any of the territories covered by the exclusive license to Renalys, Renalys will be responsible for all development, regulatory matters, and commercialization activities in such licensed territories. We will retain all rights to sparsentan in the United States and rest of world outside of the territories licensed to CSL Vifor and Renalys, provided that CSL Vifor has a right of negotiation to expand the licensed territories into Canada, China, Brazil and/or Mexico.
Pegtibatinase 
Pegtibatinase is a novel investigational human enzyme replacement candidate being evaluated for the treatment of classical homocystinuria (HCU). Classical HCU is a rare metabolic disorder characterized by elevated levels of plasma homocysteine that can lead to vision, skeletal, circulatory and central nervous system complications. We estimate that there are approximately 7,000 to 10,000 addressable HCU patients globally. Pegtibatinase has been granted Rare Pediatric Disease, Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations by the FDA, as well as orphan drug designation in the United States and European Union. 
In December 2021, we announced positive topline results from the Phase 1/2 COMPOSE Study, a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled dose escalation study to assess its safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical effects in patients with classical HCU. Pegtibatinase demonstrated dose-dependent reductions in total homocysteine (tHcy) during the 12 weeks of treatment, and in the highest dose cohort to date evaluating 1.5 mg/kg of pegtibatinase twice weekly (BIW), treatment with pegtibatinase resulted in rapid and sustained reductions in total homocysteine (tHcy) through 12 weeks of treatment, including a 55.1% mean relative reduction in tHcy from baseline as well as maintenance of tHcy below a clinically meaningful threshold of 100 μmol. Additionally, in a dose-dependent manner in the study to date, methionine levels were substantially reduced and cystathionine levels were substantially elevated following treatment with pegtibatinase, suggesting that pegtibatinase acts in a manner similar to the native CBS enzyme.

In May 2023, we announced positive topline results from the sixth cohort of the Phase 1/2 COMPOSE Study, which was initiated to inform and refine formulation work for future development and commercial purposes and to further evaluate the dose response curve for pegtibatinase, and to further inform our pivotal development program to ultimately support potential approval of pegtibatinase for the treatment of HCU.

In this cohort, five patients were randomized in a blinded fashion to receive 2.5 mg/kg of lyophilized pegtibatinase or placebo twice weekly (BIW), with four patients assigned to the treatment group. In this highest dose cohort to date, treatment with pegtibatinase resulted in rapid and sustained reductions in total homocysteine (tHcy), with a 67.1% mean relative reduction in tHcy from baseline, as well as maintenance of mean tHcy below the clinically meaningful threshold of 100 μmol, over weeks 6 to 12.

In the double-blind period, pegtibatinase was generally well-tolerated
, with no discontinuations due to treatment-related adverse events.
In December 2023, we initiated the pivotal Phase 3 HARMONY Study to support the potential approval of pegtibatinase for the treatment of classical HCU. The HARMONY Study is a global, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pegtibatinase as a novel treatment to reduce total homocysteine (tHcy) levels. In the beginning of 2024, the first patients were dosed in the HARMONY Study. 
In September 2024, we announced a voluntary pause of enrollment in the Phase 3 HARMONY Study. The voluntary enrollment pause enables us to work to address necessary process improvements in manufacturing scale-up to support commercial scale manufacturing as well as full enrollment in the HARMONY Study. Patients currently enrolled in pegtibatinase studies continue to receive study medication from small scale batches which are unaffected by the scale-up process. Currently enrolled patients will be able to continue on study medication as scheduled for the duration of the trials they are participating in. The voluntary enrollment pause was enacted following our determination that the desired drug substance profile was not achieved in the recent scale-up process. We are making progress on necessary process improvements in manufacturing scale-up and currently anticipate that we should be in position to restart enrollment in the Phase 3 HARMONY Study in 2026.
We acquired pegtibatinase as part of the November 2020 acquisition of Orphan Technologies Limited.
Preclinical Program:
We are party to a collaboration agreement with PharmaKrysto Limited and their early-stage cystinuria discovery program, whereby we are responsible for funding all research and development expenses for the pre-clinical activities associated with the cystinuria program.
Other Commercial Products:
Thiola and Thiola EC (tiopronin)
Thiola and Thiola EC are approved by the FDA for the treatment of cystinuria, a rare genetic cystine transport disorder that causes high cystine levels in the urine and the formation of recurring kidney stones. Due to the larger stone size, cystine stones may be more difficult to pass, often requiring surgical procedures to remove. More than 80 percent of people with cystinuria develop their first stone by the age of 20. More than 25 percent will develop cystine stones by the age of 10. Recurring stone formation can cause loss of kidney function in addition to substantial pain and loss of productivity associated with renal colic and stone passage. While a portion of people living with the disease are able to manage symptoms through diet and fluid intake, the prevalence of cystinuria in the U.S. is estimated to be 10,000 to 12,000, indicating that there may be as many as 4,000 to 5,000 affected individuals with cystinuria in the U.S. that would be candidates for Thiola or Thiola EC. 
In June 2019 we announced that the FDA approved 100mg and 300mg tablets of Thiola EC, an enteric-coated formulation of Thiola, to be used for the treatment of cystinuria. Thiola EC offers the potential for administration with or without food, and the ability to reduce the number of tablets necessary to manage cystinuria. Thiola EC became available to patients in July 2019.
In May 2021, a generic option for the 100mg version of the original formulation of Thiola (tiopronin tablets) became available and in June 2022, a second option for the 100mg version of the original formulation of Thiola (tiopronin tablets) was approved. These generic versions of the original formulation of Thiola have impacted our sales, and these or additional generic versions of either formulation could have a material adverse impact on sales. As of December 31, 2024, several generic options for the 100mg and 300mg versions of Thiola EC have been approved by the FDA and become available. 
Accordingly, Thiola EC is subject to generic competitio

Sale of Bile Acid Product Portfolio
On July 16, 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Mirum Pharmaceuticals" or “Mirum”), pursuant to which Mirum agreed to purchase substantially all of the assets primarily related to our business of development, manufacture (including synthesis, formulation, finishing or packaging) and commercialization of Chenodal and Cholbam (also known as Kolbam, and together with Chenodal, the “Products”), collectively, the "bile acid business". On August 31, 2023, we consummated the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (the "Closing"). In connection with the Closing, we received an upfront cash payment of $210.0 million. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, after the Closing, we are eligible to receive up to $235.0 million upon the achievement of certain milestones based on specified amounts of annual net sales (tiered from $125.0 million to $500.0 million) of the Products.

Table of Contents
A $226.0 million gain, net of tax, was recognized on the transaction as a component of net income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The bile acid business has been classified as a discontinued operation for all periods presented and is excluded from the following discussion of the results of our continuing operations in the results of operations. Refer to Note 19 of our Consolidation Financial Statements for additional information.
Strategic Reorganization
In December 2023, we implemented an approximate 20% workforce reduction focused on non-field-based employees in an effort to align our resources on the ongoing FILSPARI launch and the pivotal Phase 3 HARMONY Study to support the potential approval of pegtibatinase as the first potential disease-modifying treatment for HCU. These restructuring adjustments are expected to result in an estimated annualized savings of approximately $25.0 million beginning in 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we have incurred total non-recurring charges of $13.8 million in connection with the restructuring, and are no longer incurring restructuring expenses.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Management makes certain judgments and uses certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us, in that they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our Consolidated financial statements. For further information, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which outlines our application of significant accounting policies.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when the customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 ("ASC 606"), the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect substantially all the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.
We recognize revenues from product sales when the customer obtains control of the product, which occurs upon delivery to our customer. We receive payments from our product sales based on terms that generally are within 30 days of delivery of product to the patient.
Revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price, which includes provisions resulting from discounts, rebates and co-pay assistance that are offered to its customers, health care providers, payers and other indirect customers relating to the sale of our products. In order to determine the transaction price, we estimate, utilizing the expected value method, the amount of variable consideration to which we will be entitled. These provisions are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as a reduction of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to the customer) or as a current liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than a customer). Calculating these provisions involves estimates and judgements. Where appropriate, these reserves take into consideration our historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements and specific known market events and trends. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the contract. If actual results in the future vary from the provisions, we will adjust the provision, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded adjustments to net product revenue of $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively, related to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods. 
Government Rebates:
 We calculate the rebates that we will be obligated to provide to government programs and deduct these estimated amounts from our gross product sales at the time the revenues are recognized. Allowances for government rebates and discounts are established based on an estimated allocation of payers and the government-mandated discounts applicable to government-funded programs. Rebate discounts are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Commercial Rebates: 
We calculate the rebates we incur according to any contracts with certain commercial payers and deduct these amounts from our gross product sales at the time the revenues are recognized. Allowances for commercial rebates are established based on actual payer information, which is reasonably estimated at the time of delivery for applicable products. Rebate discounts are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
71
Table of Contents
Prompt Pay Discounts: 
We offer discounts to certain customers for prompt payments. We accrue for the calculated prompt pay discount based on the gross amount of each invoice for those customers at the time of sale.
Other Fees:
 We pay service fees to certain customers based on a contractually fixed percentage of the wholesale acquisition cost and fees for data. Other fees are recorded as an offset to revenue based on contractual terms at the time revenue from the sale is recognized. 
Product Returns:
 Consistent with industry practice, we offer our customers a limited right to return product purchased directly from us, which is principally based upon the product’s expiration date. Historically, returns have been immaterial.
Co-pay Assistance: 
We offer a co-pay assistance program, which is intended to provide financial assistance to qualified commercially insured patients with prescription drug co-payments required by payers. The calculation of the accrual for co-pay assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the estimated cost per claim associated with product that has been recognized as revenue.
Payments received under collaboration and licensing agreements may include non-refundable fees at the inception of the arrangements, milestone payments for specific achievements and royalties on the sale of products. At the inception of arrangements that include milestone payments, we use judgement to evaluate whether the milestones are probable of being achieved and estimates the amount to include in the transaction price utilizing the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur, the estimated amount is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our or the licensee’s control, such as regulatory approvals, are considered to be constrained due to a high degree of uncertainty and are not included in the transaction price until such uncertainty is resolved. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of development milestones and any related constraint and adjust the estimate of the overall transaction price, if necessary. As of December 31, 2024, our evaluation concluded that all such milestones associated with our collaboration and licensing agreements remained constrained and therefore no adjustment to the respective transaction price was necessary. We recognize aggregate sales-based milestones and royalty payments from product sales of which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, at the later of when the related sales occur or when the performance obligation to which the sales-based milestone or royalty has been allocated has been satisfied. 
We utilize significant judgement to develop estimates of the stand-alone selling price for each distinct performance obligation based upon the relative stand-alone selling price. Variable consideration that relates specifically to our efforts to satisfy specific performance obligations is allocated entirely to those performance obligations. The stand-alone selling price for license-related performance obligations requires judgement in developing assumptions to project probability-weighted cash flows based upon estimates of forecasted revenues, clinical and regulatory timelines and discount rates. The stand-alone selling price for clinical development performance obligations is based on forecasted expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation plus an appropriate margin.
If the licenses to intellectual property are determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, we recognize revenues from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to benefit from the license. For licenses that are not distinct from other promises, we apply judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjust the related revenue recognition accordingly. 
The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. Revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. We generally utilize the cost-to-cost method of progress because it best measures the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. We use judgment to estimate the total costs expected to complete the clinical development performance obligations, which include subcontractor costs, labor, materials, other direct costs and an allocation of indirect costs. We evaluate these cost estimates and the progress each reporting period and adjust the measure of progress, if necessary.
Changes in assumptions where management utilizes significant judgement could have a material impact on the revenue we recognize.
Clinical Trial Expenses 
We record expenses in connection with our clinical trials under contracts with contract research organizations ("CROs") that support conducting and managing clinical trials, as well as contract manufacturing organizations ("CMOs") for the manufacture of drug product supplies to support clinical development. The financial terms and activities of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven expense levels. Generally, these agreements set forth activities that drive the recording of expenses such as start-up, initiation activities, enrollment, treatment of patients, or the completion of other clinical trial activities, and in the case of CMOs, costs associated with the production of drug product supplied and the procurement of raw materials to be consumed in the manufacturing process.
Expenses related to clinical trials are accrued based on our estimates of the progress of services performed, including actual level of patient enrollment, completion of patient studies and progress of the clinical trials or the delivery of goods. We currently have four Phase 3 clinical trials in

process that are in varying stages of activity, with ongoing non-clinical support trials that are significant and changes in estimates could have a material impact on expenses we recognize.
Impairment of Intangible Assets subject to amortization
Intangible assets subject to amortization include certain license agreements and purchased technologies. Intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable and are also reviewed annually to determine whether any impairment is necessary.
We are subject to generic competition, and if additional generic versions of Thiola and Thiola EC, any generic versions of FILSPARI following the expiration of patent or regulatory exclusivity for the product, or any of our current or future products, are approved, sales of that product likely would be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse impact on the recoverability of certain related intangible assets. Generic versions of Thiola and Thiola EC have been approved, and these or additional generic versions of either formulation could have a material adverse impact on sales and the recoverability of the intangible assets depending on the timing of the market entry and the related impact on net sales.

Net product sales
The $99.2 million increase in total net product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to growth in sales of FILSPARI, including a full twelve months of sales in 2024, following the February 2023 launch. The decrease in net sales of our tiopronin products was a driven by increased competition.
License and collaboration revenue
The decrease in license and collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to a $8.5 million decrease in collaboration revenue associated with the CSL Vifor License Agreement due to a decrease in amortization of deferred revenue, and the $3.3 million sale of active pharmaceutical ingredients to CSL Vifor in March 2023. We estimate that the remainder of the deferred revenue balance associated with these clinical development activities, $2.8 million, will be fully realized by mid-2025. We recognize costs for clinical development activities in research and development; costs related to sale of active pharmaceutical ingredients are recognized in cost of goods sold.

Cost of goods sold
Cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory sold, third party manufacturing and supply chain costs, product shipping and handling costs, and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory. 
Prior to the February 2023 FDA accelerated approval of FILSPARI (sparsentan), we expensed the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients purchased to support the commercial launch of FILSPARI in research and development expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2024, sales of FILSPARI primarily consisted of zero-cost inventories, and therefore cost of goods sold did not increase proportionally to the increase in product sales. As of December 31, 2024, we had $2.3 million of zero-cost inventory remaining, the majority of which we expect will be consumed in 2025.
We began capitalizing inventory costs associated with FILSPARI (sparsentan) following the February 2023 approval for treatment in IgAN. At December 31, 2023, our evaluation of excess inventory and obsolescence considered certain minimum purchase obligations, which in combination with lower forecasted sales of FILSPARI resulted in a $3.2 million charge to cost of goods sold. The charge to cost of goods sold included a $2.1 million write-down of inventory balances and $1.1 million accrued for firm purchase commitments.
For the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, our cost of goods sold - license and collaboration decreased by $2.7 million, primarily due to the sale of active pharmaceutical ingredients to CSL Vifor in the first quarter of 2023. 
Research and development expenses
Research and development costs include expenses related to sparsentan, pegtibatinase and our other pipeline programs. We expense all research and development costs as they are incurred. Our research and development costs are comprised of salaries and bonuses, benefits, non-cash share-based compensation, license fees, milestones under license agreements, costs paid to third-party contractors to perform research, conduct clinical trials, and develop drug materials and delivery methods, manufacture drug product supplies to support clinical development, and associated overhead expenses and facilities costs. We charge direct internal and external program costs to the respective development programs. We also incur indirect costs that are not allocated to specific programs because such costs benefit multiple development programs and allow us to increase our pharmaceutical development capabilities. These consist of internal shared resources related to the development and maintenance of systems and processes applicable to all of our programs. 
We currently have four Phase 3 clinical trials in process that are in various stages of activity, with ongoing non-clinical support trials. As such, clinical trial expenses will vary depending on the all the factors set forth above and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year.
We routinely engage vendors and service providers for scientific research, clinical trial, regulatory compliance, manufacturing and other consulting services. We also make grants to research and non-profit organizations to conduct research which may lead to new intellectual properties that we may subsequently license under separately negotiated license agreements. Such grants may be funded in lump sums or installments.

For the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, our research and development expenses decreased by $27.5 million. Internal personnel costs to support all programs decreased by $10.8 million, primarily as a result of restructuring initiatives. External service provider costs decreased by $16.7 million, which was largely driven by a decrease in costs associated with the development of sparsentan as our Phase 3 programs advance towards completion, offset by an increase in costs associated with the development of pegtibatinase following the December 2023 initiation of the Phase 3 HARMONY Study. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and bonuses, benefits, non-cash share-based compensation, legal and other professional fees, rent, depreciation and amortization, travel, insurance, business development, sales and marketing programs, and other operating expenses. 
In-process research and development expense
In March 2024, we recognized a non-recurring $65.2 million charge in in-process research and development (IPR&D) expense upon the achievement of a development milestone associated with our treatment candidate pegtibatinase, which was paid during the second quarter of 2024 and recorded within investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We acquired pegtibatinase as part of the November 2020 acquisition of Orphan Technologies Limited.
Restructuring expenses
In December 2023, we implemented an approximate 20% workforce reduction focused on non-field-based employees in an effort to align our resources on the ongoing FILSPARI launch and the pivotal Phase 3 HARMONY Study to support the potential approval of pegtibatinase as the first potential disease-modifying treatment for HCU. These restructuring initiatives were expected to result in an estimated non-recurring charge of approximately $12.0 million to $14.0 million, the majority of which was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the $13.8 million recognized to date, $2.4 million was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024, including $1.2 million related to impairment and disposal costs and initial direct costs to obtain a sublease. Restructuring costs were primarily comprised of one-time termination benefits, including severance, continuation of health insurance coverage, and other benefits for a specified period of time. In 2024, we recognized charges for impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets and related leasehold improvements, as well as disposal costs on furniture and fixtures associated with available office space that we decided to sublease as a result of the reduction in occupancy. As of December 31, 2024, we are no longer incurring restructuring expenses.

The $265.8 million change in (loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 is primarily due to the August 31, 2023 sale of our bile acid business, which resulted in a gain, net of tax, of $226.0 million. The gain consists of net consideration, including the upfront payment and the deduction of investment banker fees owed upon the Closing, plus the derecognition of the carrying value of the net liabilities included in the transaction and the immaterial tax due on the sale. 
See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We have financed our operations through a combination of borrowings, sales of our equity securities, and revenues generated from our commercialized products, along with proceeds from license and collaboration agreements and the divestiture of our bile acid business. We experienced significant growth in recent years in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations. We also expanded our sales and marketing, compliance and legal functions in addition to expansion of all functions to support a commercial organization, including by adding additional members to our sales force in connection with the recent commercial launch of FILSPARI in the United States for IgAN. In December 2023, we implemented an approximate 20% workforce reduction focused on non-field-based employees in an effort to align our resources on the ongoing FILSPARI launch and the pivotal Phase 3 HARMONY Study to support the potential approval of pegtibatinase as the first potential disease-modifying treatment for HCU. 
We believe that our available cash and short-term investments as of the date of this filing, together with anticipated cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our anticipated level of operations beyond the next 12 months from the date of this filing. We expect that our operating results will vary from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year depending upon various factors including revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses, and research and development expenses, particularly with respect to our clinical and preclinical development activities. Our ability to fund our operations in subsequent years will depend upon certain factors which are beyond our control and may require us to obtain additional debt or equity capital or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the 2025 Notes and 2029 Notes, on or before maturity. Though we generate revenues from product sales arrangements, we may incur significant operating losses over the next several years. Our ability to achieve profitable operations in the future will depend in large part upon completing development of products in our pipeline, obtaining regulatory approvals for these products and bringing these products to market, along with potential in-licensing of additional products approved by the FDA and selling and manufacturing these products.

Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $58.5 million and available-for-sale marketable debt securities of $312.2 million. Substantial sources of funds since the beginning of 2024, as summarized further below, include net proceeds of $134.7 million from an underwritten public offering of our common stock.
Over the next 12 months, our expected financial obligations include, but are not limited to, funding our operations, operating lease payments, interest payments on our outstanding debt, anticipated milestone payments, royalties on sales of our existing commercialized products, research and development expenses pertaining to clinical and preclinical development activities across our pipeline, expenses associated with the launch of FILSPARI and the anticipated repayment of the outstanding principal of approximately $68.9 million on the 2025 Notes which mature on September 15, 2025. Sources of cash over this period include net revenues from sales of our products, the sale or maturity of investments in our portfolio of marketable debt securities, and certain earned and potential milestone payments. We anticipate achieving milestones with FILSPARI that will result in us receiving payments of approximately $17.5 million during the next 12 months, with the potential for additional milestone payments depending on timing and outcomes that are currently uncertain.
Beyond the next 12 months and over the foreseeable future, our known commitments and potential financial obligations will likely include ongoing operations funding, operating lease payments, interest payments on our outstanding debt, royalties on sales of our existing commercialized products, research and development expenses pertaining to clinical and preclinical development activities across our pipeline, milestone and royalty payments associated with FILSPARI, pegtibatinase, and other developmental programs based upon the achievement of certain agreement-specific criteria, along with sales-based royalties and the repayment of principal on the outstanding 2029 Notes, which mature on September 1, 2029. Potential sources of cash over this time horizon may include net revenues from sales of our existing products and, if commercialized, our pipeline products, licensing revenue, the sale or maturity of marketable debt securities in our investment portfolio, the refinancing of all or a portion of our debt, on or before maturity, or the issuance of additional debt or equity. In addition, depending on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors, we may also from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. We may not be able to successfully conduct financing or refinancing activity on favorable terms or at all.
Purchase Agreement Proceeds 
Sale of Bile Acid Product Portfolio
In July 2023, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Mirum, pursuant to which Mirum agreed to purchase substantially all of the assets primarily related to our business of development, manufacture and commercialization of the Products, which comprised our bile acid business. Upon the Closing of the transaction on August 31, 2023, we received an upfront cash payment of $210.0 million. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, we are eligible to receive up to $235.0 million upon the achievement of certain milestones based on specified amounts of annual net sales (tiered from $125.0 million to $500.0 million) of the Products. 
Collaboration and License Proceeds
License and Collaboration Agreement with CSL Vifor
In September, 2021, we entered into a License Agreement with CSL Vifor, pursuant to which we granted an exclusive license to CSL Vifor for the commercialization of sparsentan in the Licensed Territories. Under the terms of the License Agreement, we will be eligible for up to $135.0 million in aggregate regulatory and market access related milestone payments and up to $655.0 million in aggregate sales-based milestone payments for a total potential value of up to $845.0 million. We are also entitled to receive tiered double-digit royalties of up to 40 percent of annual net sales of sparsentan in the Licensed Territories.
See Note 4 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Licensing Agreement with Renalys
In January 2024, our license agreement with Renalys Pharma, Inc. came into effect. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted an exclusive license to Renalys for the commercialization of sparsentan in Japan and other countries in Asia. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we are eligible to receive up to $120.0 million in regulatory, development and sales-based milestone payments. We are also entitled to receive tiered double-digit to mid-20 percent royalties of annual net sales of sparsentan in the licensed territories. In addition, we received an option to purchase shares of common stock of Renalys (“Option Agreement”), which we exercised in January 2024. We also have the option to purchase all equity securities of Renalys at any time prior to the top-line results of the Phase 3 trial in Japan (“Buyout Right”).

Equity Offerings
2024 Underwritten Public Offering of Common Stock
In November 2024, we sold an aggregate of approximately 9.0 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering, at a price to the public of $16.00 per share of common stock. The net proceeds to us from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were approximately $134.7 million.
2023 Underwritten Public Offering of Common Stock
In February 2023, we sold an aggregate of approximately 9.7 million shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase 1.25 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering, at a price to the public of $21.00 per share of common stock and $20.9999 per pre-funded warrant. The pre-funded warrants are exercisable immediately, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations which can be modified by the respective holders with at least 61 days' notice, and are exercisable for one share of our common stock. The exercise price of each pre-funded warrant is $0.0001 per share of common stock. The net proceeds to us from the offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were approximately $215.8 million. All of the pre-funded warrants were exercised in the third quarter of 2024, resulting in the issuance of 1.25 million shares of our common stock.
At-the-Market Equity Offering
In October 2024, we filed a prospectus supplement to the prospectus included in our registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-281194), pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time through Jefferies LLC, as agent (“Jefferies”), up to $100.0 million of our common stock pursuant to an Amended and Restated Open Market Sale Agreement ("ATM Agreement") with Jefferies dated October 2024. We did not sell any shares under the ATM Agreement during the year ended December 31, 2024. 
Operating Leases
Future Minimum Rental Commitments
As of December 31, 2024, we have future minimum rental commitments totaling $25.4 million arising from our operating leases. These commitments represent the aggregate base rent through August 2028. 
See Note 18 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Purchase Commitments
Manufactured Product
Certain of our contractual arrangements with contract manufacturing organizations ("CMOs") require binding forecasts or commitments to purchase minimum amounts for the manufacture of drug product supply, which may be material to our financial statements.
Royalties and Contingent Cash Payments
Ligand License Agreement
In 2012, we entered into an agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Ligand") for a worldwide sublicense to develop, manufacture and commercialize sparsentan (the “Ligand License Agreement”). As consideration for the license, we are required to make substantial payments upon the achievement of certain milestones, totaling up to $114.1 million. Through December 31, 2024, we have capitalized $47.2 million for contractual milestones achieved under the Ligand License Agreement, which includes a $5.8 million regulatory milestone payment to Ligand (and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ("BMS")) in the second quarter of 2024. Following commercialization of sparsentan or any products containing related compounds, we are obligated to pay to Ligand an escalating royalty between 15% and 17% of net sales of all such products, with payments due quarterly. We began incurring costs associated with such royalties following the February 2023 approval of FILSPARI (sparsentan). For the year ended December 31, 2024, we capitalized $20.3 million to intangible assets for royalties owed on net sales of FILSPARI. 
The Ligand License Agreement will continue until neither party has any further payment obligations under the agreement and is expected to continue for up to 20 years from the effective date. Ligand may terminate the Ligand License Agreement due to (i) our insolvency, (ii) our material uncured breach of the agreement, (iii) our failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize sparsentan as described above or (iv) certain other conditions. We may terminate the Ligand License Agreement due to a material uncured breach of the agreement by Ligand.

Mission License Agreement
In 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Mission Pharmacal ("Mission"), pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to market, sell and commercialize Thiola (tiopronin) in the United States and Canada, and a non-exclusive license to use know-how relating to Thiola to the extent necessary to market Thiola ("Mission License Agreement"). Under the terms of the Mission License Agreement, as subsequently amended, which runs through May 2029, we are obligated to pay to Mission the greater of $2.1 million, representing the guaranteed minimum royalty, or 20% of our Thiola net sales generated globally during each calendar year. 
See Note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Acquisition of Orphan Technologies Limited
In November 2020, we completed the acquisition of Orphan Technologies Limited (“Orphan”), including Orphan’s rare metabolic disorder drug pegtibatinase. We acquired Orphan by purchasing all of its outstanding shares. Under the Stock Purchase Agreement ("the Agreement"), we agreed to make contingent cash payments up to an aggregate of $427.0 million based on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercialization events as set forth in the Agreement, as well as additional tiered mid-single digit royalty payments based upon future net sales of any pegtibatinase products in the U.S. and Europe, subject to certain reductions as set forth in the Agreement, and a contingent payment in the event a pediatric rare disease voucher for any pegtibatinase product is granted. We made a $65.0 million payment to Orphan in the second quarter of 2024 following the achievement of a development milestone. 
Stock Purchase and Collaboration Agreement with PharmaKrysto
On March 8, 2022, we entered into a Collaboration Agreement with PharmaKrysto Limited (“PharmaKrysto”), a privately held pre-clinical stage company related to PharmaKrysto's early-stage cystinuria discovery program, and concurrently therewith entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with PharmaKrysto (together, the "Agreements"). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreements, we acquired 5% of the outstanding common shares and are required to purchase an additional 5% of the outstanding common shares for $1.0 million upon the occurrence of a specified pre-clinical milestone. The Agreements also require us to fund all research and development expenses for the pre-clinical activities associated with the cystinuria program, which are expected to be approximately $5.0 million. In addition, the Agreements grant us an option to purchase the remaining outstanding shares of PharmaKrysto for $5.0 million upon the occurrence of a subsequent pre-clinical milestone prior to expiration of the option on March 8, 2025. If we elect to exercise the option, we would be required to perform commercially reasonable clinical diligence obligations. In addition, we would be required to make cash milestone payments totaling up to an aggregate $16.0 million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones, plus tiered royalty payments of less than 4% on future net sales of a product, if approved. We have the right to terminate the Agreements and sell the shares back for a nominal payment at any time upon 60 days' notice, subject to survival of contingent obligations, if any.
See Note 5 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
French Rebate Accrual 
In October 2021, our distributor in France for our previously marketed product Kolbam informed us that they had received a notice that the price previously paid for Kolbam during its period on the market in France had been recalculated by the agency responsible for pharmaceutical pricing in France. As of December 31, 2023, $5.4 million for estimated amounts to be repaid was recorded in Accrued Expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In October 2024, we received an invoice from the government authority in the amount of $6.2 million (€5.6 million) for reimbursement of amounts previously paid for Kolbam, which we paid in November 2024. We have appealed the pricing decision and will pursue an appeal of the amount paid with the Competent Administrative Court. 
Borrowings
Convertible Senior Notes Due 2029
On March 11, 2022, we completed a registered underwritten public offering of $316.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (“2029 Notes”). We issued the 2029 Notes under an indenture, dated as of September 10, 2018, as supplemented by the second supplemental indenture, dated as of March 11, 2022 (collectively, the “2029 Indenture”). The 2029 Notes will mature on March 1, 2029, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted. The 2029 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of ours and bear interest at an annual rate of 2.25%, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2022. The 2029 Notes do not contain any financial or operating covenants or any restrictions on the payment of dividends, the issuance of other indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us.

Table of Contents
Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025
On September 10, 2018, we completed a registered underwritten public offering of $276.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 ("2025 Notes"), and entered into a base indenture and supplemental indenture agreement ("2025 Indenture") with respect to the 2025 Notes. The 2025 Notes will mature on September 15, 2025, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted. The 2025 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at an annual rate of 2.50%, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2019. On March 11, 2022, coinciding with the issuance of the 2029 Notes, we completed our repurchase of $207.1 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes for cash. After giving effect to the repurchase, the total remaining principal amount outstanding under the 2025 Notes as of December 31, 2024 was $68.9 million. The 2025 Notes do not contain any financial or operating covenants or any restrictions on the payment of dividends, the issuance of other indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us.
See Note 7 to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Funding Requirements
We believe that our available cash and short-term investments as of the date of this filing will be sufficient to fund our anticipated level of operations beyond the next 12 months from the date of this filing. We expect to use cash flows from operations and, when necessary, outside financings, to meet our current and future financial obligations, including funding our operations, debt service and capital expenditures. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Factors that may affect financing requirements include, but are not limited to:
•
the timing, progress, cost and results of our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities;
•
the timing and outcome of, and costs involved in, seeking and obtaining marketing approvals for our products, and in maintaining quality systems standards for our products;
•

Management considers marketable debt securities to be available to fund current operations, and they are classified as available for sale and included within current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Therefore, cash and short-term investments available to fund operations is $370.7 million as of December 31, 2024.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Cash used in operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $230.0 million compared to cash used of $325.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash used was due to a $99.2 million increase in total net product sales, along with a decrease in operational spending as a result of the restructuring plan initiated in December 2023.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $99.3 million compared to cash provided of $151.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change was due to a decrease in net purchases of marketable debt securities, offset by a $65.0 million payment to Orphan in the second quarter of 2024 following the achievement of a development milestone.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $139.4 million compared to cash provided of $220.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change was due to the November 2024 issuance of common stock through an underwritten public offering that provided $134.7 million in net proceeds, compared to $215.8 million in net proceeds from the March 2023 issuance of common stock and pre-funded warrants.
ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Our primary exposure to market risk is related to changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash equivalents and marketable debt securities of approximately $370.7 million, consisting of money market funds, U.S. government agency debt, corporate debt and commercial paper. This exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because our investments are in short-term debt securities. Our marketable debt securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates continue to increase. Due to the short-term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments, a change in interest rates of 100 basis points would have approximately a $1.7 million impact on our investments. 
81
Table of Contents
The marketable debt securities held in our investment portfolio may subject us to credit risk, though our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. Given these policy restrictions and our emphasis on preserving capital and liquidity while enhancing overall returns, we have not experienced material credit-related losses with our securities holdings.
We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. From time to time, we enter into contracts with vendors that are located outside of the United States, which contracts are denominated in foreign currencies. We are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rated in connection with these agreements. We do not currently hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk.
Inflation generally affects us by increasing our salaries and fees paid to third-party contract service providers. Inflationary pressures have primarily impacted our operations through increased labor costs. While we continue to monitor the effects of macroeconomic factors, inflationary pressures have not affected our current outlook or business objectives.
ITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
The Consolidated Financial Statements and supplementary data of Travere Therapeutics, Inc. required by this Item are described in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are presented beginning on page F-1.   
ITEM 9.    CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.
ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timelines specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a–15(e) and 15d-15(e)), as of the end of the year covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:
(1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
(2) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and directors; and
(3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment 
82
Table of Contents
and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company.
Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework)
 published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, known as COSO, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this assessment, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. Ernst & Young LLP ("EY"), our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
An evaluation was also performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of any change to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2024 and that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Travere Therapeutics, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Travere Therapeutics, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Travere Therapeutics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024 and the related notes and our report dated February 20, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Travere Therapeutics, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Travere Therapeutics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 20, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures

to which it relates.

Government rebate deductions from revenue
Description of the Matter
As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Deductions from Revenue”, the Company calculates the rebates for Filspari that it will be obligated to provide to government programs and deducts these estimated amounts from its gross product sales at the time the revenues are recognized. Allowances for government rebates and discounts are established based on an estimated allocation of payers and the government-mandated discounts applicable to government-funded programs. Where appropriate, these allowances take into consideration the Company’s historical experience, current statutory requirements and specific known market events and trends. Estimated government rebates are included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet.
Auditing the Filspari government rebate deductions from revenue was complex and required significant auditor judgment because the related accruals were dependent on certain subjective assumptions. Such subjective assumptions included estimated allocations of payers and estimated government-mandated discounts applicable to government-funded programs, each of which are adjusted for the Company’s historical experience, current statutory requirements and specific known market events and trends, where appropriate.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s Filspari government rebate deductions from revenue process. This included testing controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions described above and other inputs into the estimation of government rebates including the accuracy of data used in the calculation. 
To test the Filspari government rebate deductions from revenue, our audit procedures included, among others, understanding and evaluating the significant assumptions and underlying data used in management’s calculations. Our testing of significant assumptions included a lookback analysis to evaluate the historical accuracy of management’s estimates by comparing actual activity to previous estimates and performing sensitivity analyses over the subjective assumptions to evaluate the completeness of the reserves. As a part of our procedures, we evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s assumptions considering recent sales trends and regulatory factors related to Filspari government rebates.

TRAVERE THERAPEUTICS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1.    
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Organization and Description of Business
Travere Therapeutics, Inc. (“we”, “our”, “us”, “Travere” and the “Company”) refers to Travere Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, as well as its subsidiaries. Travere is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company headquartered in San Diego, California focused on identifying, developing and delivering life-changing therapies to people living with rare kidney and metabolic diseases. The Company regularly evaluates and, where appropriate, acts on opportunities to expand its product pipeline and approved products through licenses and acquisitions of products in areas that will serve rare disease patients with serious 
unmet medical need
 and that the Company believes offer attractive growth characteristics.
Discontinued Operations - Sale of Bile Acid Product Portfolio
In July 2023, Travere entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Mirum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Mirum Pharmaceuticals" or “Mirum”), pursuant to which Mirum agreed to purchase from Travere substantially all of the assets primarily related to Travere’s business of development, manufacture (including synthesis, formulation, finishing or packaging) and commercialization of Chenodal and Cholbam (also known as Kolbam, and together with Chenodal, the “Products”), collectively, the "bile acid business". On August 31, 2023, the Company and Mirum consummated the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement (the “Closing”). In connection with the Closing, Mirum paid Travere an upfront cash payment of $
210.0
 million. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Travere is eligible to receive up to $
235.0
 million upon the achievement of certain milestones based on specified amounts of annual net sales (tiered from $
125.0
 million to $
500.0
 million) of the Products. The Company has reflected the bile acid business as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented. See Note 19 for further discussion. 
Unless otherwise noted, amounts and disclosures throughout the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements relate to the Company's continuing operations.
Approved Products:
FILSPARI® (sparsentan)
On September 5, 2024, the FDA granted full approval of FILSPARI® (sparsentan) to slow kidney function decline in adults with primary Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) who are at risk of disease progression. FILSPARI is the only oral, once-daily, non-immunosuppressive medication that directly targets glomerular injury in the kidney by blocking two critical pathways of IgAN disease progression (endothelin-1 and angiotensin II).
FILSPARI had previously been granted accelerated approval in February 2023 based on the surrogate marker of proteinuria. Full approval is based on positive long-term confirmatory results from the PROTECT Study demonstrating that FILSPARI significantly slowed kidney function decline over two years compared to irbesartan. 
In September 2021, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Vifor (International) Ltd. ("CSL Vifor"). In April 2024, the Company and CSL Vifor announced that the European Commission has granted conditional marketing authorization (“CMA”) for FILSPARI (sparsentan) for the treatment of adults with primary IgAN with a urine protein excretion ≥1.0 g/day (or urine protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥0.75 g/g). The CMA is granted for all member states of the European Union, as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The European Commission's decision follows the positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) in February 2024, based on results from the pivotal Phase 3 PROTECT Study of FILSPARI in IgAN. Under the terms of the License Agreement, the Company will be entitled to receive a regulatory milestone payment of $
17.5
 million upon receipt of full regulatory approval by the European Commission for IgAN, and an additional milestone payment upon achievement of market access initiatives in certain countries. FILSPARI became commercially available in Europe under the CMA in August 2024, with an initial launch in Germany and Austria. In October 2024, the Company and CSL Vifor announced that Swissmedic has granted temporary marketing authorization for FILSPARI for the treatment of adults with primary IgAN with a urine protein excretion ≥1.0 g/day (or urine protein-to-creatinine ratio ≥0.75 g/g). In November 2024, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approved FILSPARI in the United Kingdom.
In January 2024, the Company entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Renalys Pharma, Inc. ("Renalys"), to bring sparsentan for the treatment of IgAN to patients in Japan and other countries in Asia, for the treatment of IgAN. Renalys will hold regional rights to sparsentan for Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Following successful meetings with the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in 2023, in the second quarter of 2024 Renalys initiated an 
F-10
Table of Contents
open label registration study of sparsentan in Japan to support potential approval of sparsentan in Japan. In July 2024, Renalys announced that the first patient was dosed in the study, and in January 2025, Renalys announced achievement of full enrollment in the study. In December 2024, Renalys announced that sparsentan received Orphan Drug Designation from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for the indication of primary IgA nephropathy as of November 27, 2024. Under the terms of the licensing agreement, Renalys will be responsible for development, regulatory matters, and commercialization in the licensed territories.
Thiola® and Thiola EC® (tiopronin tablets) 
Thiola® and Thiola EC® (tiopronin tablets) are approved in the United States for the prevention of cystine (kidney) stone formation in patients with severe homozygous cystinuria.
Clinical-Stage Programs:
Sparsentan for the treatment of FSGS
Sparsentan remains a novel investigational product candidate which has been granted Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in the U.S. and the European Economic Area countries (the “EEA”). In December 2023, the Company announced that it had completed a planned Type C meeting with the FDA to discuss previously reported results from the Phase 3 DUPLEX Study of sparsentan in FSGS. The FDA acknowledged the high unmet need for approved therapies as well as the challenges in studying FSGS but indicated that the two-year results from the Phase 3 DUPLEX Study alone were not sufficient to support an sNDA submission. In February 2025, the Company announced that it had completed a Type C meeting with the FDA and that the Company plans to submit an sNDA around the end of the first quarter of 2025. The sNDA will be based on existing data from the Phase 3 DUPLEX and Phase 2 DUET studies of FILSPARI. 
Pegtibatinase
Pegtibatinas
e is a novel investigational human enzyme replacement candidate being evaluated for the treatment of classical homocystinuria (HCU). Pegtibatinase has been granted Rare Pediatric Disease, Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations by the FDA, as well as orphan drug designation in the United States and European Union. In May 2023, the Company announced positive topline results from cohort 6 in the Phase 1/2 COMPOSE Study. 
In December 2023, the Company initiated the pivotal Phase 3 HARMONY Study to support the potential approval of pegtibatinase for the treatment of classical HCU. The HARMONY Study is a global, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pegtibatinase as a novel treatment to reduce total homocysteine (tHcy) levels. In the beginning of 2024, the first patients were dosed in the HARMONY Study. 
In September 2024, the Company announced a voluntary pause of enrollment in the Phase 3 HARMONY Study. The voluntary enrollment pause enables the Company to work to address necessary process improvements in manufacturing scale-up to support commercial scale manufacturing as well as full enrollment in the HARMONY Study. Patients currently enrolled in pegtibatinase studies continue to receive study medication from small scale batches which are unaffected by the scale-up process. Currently enrolled patients will be able to continue on study medication as scheduled for the duration of the trials they are participating in. The voluntary enrollment pause was enacted following our determination that the desired drug substance profile was not achieved in the recent scale-up process. The Company expects to further evaluate the necessary commercial process improvements to enable the continuation of the Phase 3 program.
The Company
 acquired pegtibatinase as part of the November 2020 acquisition of Orphan Technologies Limited.
Preclinical Programs:
The Company is party to a collaboration agreement with PharmaKrysto Limited and their early-stage cystinuria discovery program, whereby the Company is responsible for funding all research and development expenses for the pre-clinical activities associated with the cystinuria program.
NOTE 2.    
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A summary of the significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements follows:
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements represent the consolidation of the accounts of the Company, its subsidiaries and variable interest entities for which the Company has been determined to be the primary beneficiary, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
 See Note 5 for further discussion of variable interest entities (“VIE”) that the Company consolidates.
F-11
Table of Contents
Use of Estimates
In preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Due to inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be affected by changes in these estimates. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue recognition, forecasting probability-weighted cash flows based upon estimates of forecasted revenues, clinical and regulatory timelines and discount rates, valuing equity securities in share-based payments, estimating expenses of contracted research organizations, estimating reserves for inventory, estimating the useful lives of depreciable and amortizable assets, estimating of valuation allowances and uncertain tax positions, and estimates associated with the assessment of impairment for long-lived assets.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 ("ASC 606"), the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only recognizes revenue from contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect substantially all the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.
 See Note 3 and Note 4 for further discussion. 
Payments received under collaboration and licensing agreements may include non-refundable fees at the inception of the arrangements, milestone payments for specific achievements and royalties on the sale of products. At the inception of arrangements that include milestone payments, the Company uses judgment to evaluate whether the milestones are probable of being achieved and estimates the amount to include in the transaction price utilizing the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur, the estimated amount is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the Company or the licensee’s control, such as regulatory approvals, are considered to be constrained due to a high degree of uncertainty and are not included in the transaction price until such uncertainty is resolved. At the end of each reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of development milestones and any related constraint and adjusts the estimate of the overall transaction price, if necessary. The Company recognizes aggregate sales-based milestones and royalty payments from product sales of which the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, at the later of when the related sales occur or when the performance obligation has been satisfied. Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements may also include sales of inventory, at cost plus a margin, which is recorded in license and collaboration revenue.
The Company utilizes significant judgment to develop estimates of the stand-alone selling price for each distinct performance obligation based upon the relative stand-alone selling price. Variable consideration that relates specifically to the Company’s efforts to satisfy specific performance obligations is allocated entirely to those performance obligations. The stand-alone selling price for license-related performance obligations requires judgment in developing assumptions to project probability-weighted cash flows based upon estimates of forecasted revenues, clinical and regulatory timelines and discount rates. The stand-alone selling price for clinical development performance obligations is based on forecasted expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation plus an appropriate margin.
If the licenses to intellectual property are determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement and have stand-alone functionality, the Company recognizes revenues from non-refundable, upfront fees allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to benefit from the license. For licenses that are not distinct from other promises, the Company applies judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from non-refundable, upfront fees. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the related revenue recognition accordingly. 
The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. Revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. The Company generally utilizes the cost-to-cost method of progress because it best measures the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as the Company incurs costs. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. The Company uses judgment to estimate the total costs expected to complete the clinical development performance obligations, which include subcontractor costs, labor, materials, other direct costs and an allocation of indirect costs. The Company evaluates these cost estimates and the progress each reporting period and adjusts the measure of progress, if necessary.
Inventory, Related Reserves and Cost of Goods Sold
Inventory, which is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value, includes materials and other direct and indirect costs and is valued using the first-in, first-out method. The Company periodically analyzes its inventory levels to identify inventory that may expire prior to expected sale or has a cost basis in excess of its estimated realizable value, and writes down such inventory as appropriate. In addition, the Company's products are 
F-12

subject to strict quality control and monitoring which the Company’s manufacturers perform throughout their manufacturing process. The Company does not directly manufacture any product. The Company has a single supplier for its product Thiola, and utilizes contract service providers for the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for FILSPARI and the manufacture of primary packaging, secondary packaging and serialization for its product FILSPARI.
 The inventory reserve was $

The balance classified as long-term inventory consists of raw materials, work in process and finished goods for both Thiola and FILSPARI as of December 31, 2024. The Company maintains levels of these inventories beyond a one-year production plan to limit exposure to potential supply disruption. Such inventories are classified as long-term.
Cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory sold, third party manufacturing and supply chain costs, product shipping, tracking and handling costs, and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory. Cost of goods sold also includes the cost of goods sold under the Company's license and collaboration agreements, which generally consists of the sale of active pharmaceutical ingredients to the Company's collaboration partners, generally at cost plus a margin.

Capitalization of Inventory Costs
Prior to the regulatory approval of the Company's drug candidates, the Company incurs expenses for the manufacture of drug product supplies to support clinical development that could potentially be available to support the commercial launch of those drugs. The Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with its products after regulatory approval, when, based on management’s judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. Until the date at which regulatory approval has been received, costs related to the production of inventory are recorded as research and development expenses as incurred. Any eventual sale of previously expensed ("zero-cost") inventories may impact future margins, for any periods in which those inventories are sold. 
Prior to the February 2023 FDA accelerated approval of FILSPARI (sparsentan), the Company expensed the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients purchased to support the commercial launch of FILSPARI, in research and development expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2024, sales of FILSPARI primarily consisted of zero-cost inventories. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $
2.3
 million of zero-cost inventory remaining, the majority of which the Company expects will be consumed in 2025. The Company began capitalizing inventory costs associated with FILSPARI following the February 2023 accelerated approval.
At December 31, 2024, the Company's evaluation of excess inventory and obsolescence resulted in a $
1.0
 million charge to cost of goods sold and an equal write-down of inventory balances due to lower forecasted sales of the Company's tiopronin products. For the year ended December 31, 2024, there were 
no
 charges recorded on FILSPARI inventory.
At December 31, 2023, the Company's evaluation of excess inventory and obsolescence considered certain minimum purchase obligations, which in combination with lower forecasted sales of FILSPARI resulted in a $
3.2
 million charge to cost of goods sold. The charge to cost of goods of sold included a $
2.1
 million write-down of inventory balances and $
1.1
 million accrued for firm purchase commitments.

Table of Contents
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development includes expenses related to sparsentan, pegtibatinase, and the Company's other pipeline programs. The Company expenses all research and development costs as they are incurred. The Company's research and development costs are composed of salaries and bonuses, benefits, share-based compensation, license fees, milestones under license agreements, costs paid to third-party contractors to perform research, conduct clinical trials, costs to develop drug materials and delivery devices, costs to manufacture drug product supplies to support clinical development, and associated overhead expenses and facilities costs. The Company charges direct internal and external program costs to the respective development programs. The Company also incurs indirect costs that are not allocated to specific programs because such costs benefit multiple development programs and allow us to increase our pharmaceutical development capabilities. These consist of internal shared resources related to the development and maintenance of systems and processes applicable to all of our programs. 
Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed, or when it is no longer expected that the goods will be delivered or the services rendered.
During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an out of period adjustment that decreased research and development expenses and related accrued expenses by $
7.7
 million, $
1.5
 million of which was previously recorded in fiscal year 2022 and $
6.2
 million that was originally recorded in fiscal year 2021. The adjustment was the result of a certain pre-launch inventory contract that was not properly evaluated for accounting implications at inception. The Company evaluated the impact of the adjustment and concluded it is not material, individually and in the aggregate, to 2022 or any prior period financial statements.
Clinical Trial Expenses
The Company records expenses in connection with its clinical trials under contracts with contract research organizations ("CROs") that support conducting and managing clinical trials, as well as contract manufacturing organizations ("CMOs") for the manufacture of drug product supplies to support clinical development. The financial terms and activities of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven expense levels. Generally, these agreements set forth activities that drive the recording of expenses such as start-up, initiation activities, enrollment, treatment of patients, or the completion of other clinical trial activities, and in the case of CMOs, costs associated with the production of drug product supplied and the procurement of raw materials to be consumed in the manufacturing process.
Expenses related to clinical trials are accrued based on our estimates of the progress of services performed, including actual level of patient enrollment, completion of patient studies and progress of the clinical trials or the delivery of goods. Other incidental costs related to patient enrollment or treatment are accrued when reasonably certain. If the amounts we are obligated to pay under our clinical trial agreements are modified (for instance, as a result of changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed), the Company adjusts its estimates accordingly on a prospective basis. Revisions to the Company's contractual payment obligations are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become reasonably certain.
The Company currently has 
four
 Phase 3 clinical trials in process that are in varying stages of activity, with ongoing non-clinical support trials. As such, clinical trial expenses will vary depending on all the factors set forth above and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company recognizes all employee share-based compensation as a cost within research and development expenses and selling, general, and administrative expenses. Equity-classified awards principally related to stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units ("PSUs"), are measured at the grant date fair value of the award. The Company determines grant date fair value of stock option awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of RSUs and PSUs are determined using the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. For service based vesting grants, expense is recognized over the requisite service period. For PSUs, expense is recognized over the implicit service period, once vesting is probable. No expense is recognized for PSUs if it is not probable the vesting criteria will be satisfied. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.

Earnings (Loss) Per Share
The Company calculates basic earnings per share by dividing net income/(loss) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Pre-funded warrants issued and sold by the Company to purchase shares of its common stock are included in the calculation of basic net loss per common share if the exercise price of the pre-funded warrant represents little consideration and is non-substantive in relation to the price paid for the warrant, and if the warrants are immediately exercisable with no further vesting conditions or contingencies associated with them.
F-14
Table of Contents
The Company's diluted earnings/(loss) per share computation includes the effect, if any, of shares that would be issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options, convertible debt and RSUs, reduced by the number of shares which are assumed to be purchased by the Company from the resulting proceeds at the average market price during the year, when such amounts are dilutive to the earnings per share calculation. In accordance with ASC 260, 
Earnings per Share
, if a company had a discontinued operation, the company uses income from continuing operations, adjusted for preferred dividend and similar adjustments, as its control number to determine whether potential common shares are dilutive.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid marketable securities with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Due to the short-term maturity of such investments, the carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Concentration of Credit Risk
The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents at insured financial institutions, the balances of which may, at times, exceed federally insured limits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand, and the Company believes there is minimal risk of losses on such balances.
The Company monitors its investments with counterparties with the objective of minimizing concentrations of credit risk. The Company's investment policy is to invest only in institutions that meet high credit quality standards and established limits on the amount and time to maturity of investments with any individual counterparty. The policy also requires that investments are only entered into with corporate and financial institutions that meet high quality standards.
Marketable Debt Securities
The Company classified marketable debt securities held as “available-for-sale” and carries them at fair value. The Company classifies these investments as current assets, even if the maturity when acquired by the Company is greater than one year due to the ability to liquidate within the next 12 months. The amortized cost of marketable debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion, as well as interest and dividends, is included in interest income. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable debt securities are recorded as a separate component of stockholders’ equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss, unless an impairment is determined to be the result of credit-related factors or the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery. Unrealized losses that are determined to be credit-related are recorded as an allowance against the amortized cost basis. Realized gains or losses on debt security transactions and declines in value that are determined to be the result of credit losses, if any, are reported in other income or expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Marketable debt securities are maintained at one financial institution and are governed by the Company’s investment policy. See Note 6 for further discussion.
Accounts Receivables, Net
Trade accounts receivable are recorded net of reserves for prompt pay discounts and expected credit losses. Estimates for allowances for credit losses are determined based on existing contractual obligations, historical payment patterns and individual customer circumstances. The allowance for credit losses was 
zero
 at both December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, bad debt expense recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations was immaterial. The Company's evaluation of credit losses for the current period included an assessment of our aged trade receivables balances and their underlying credit risk characteristics. Our evaluation of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future resulted in an expectation of immaterial credit losses.

Supplier Concentration Risk
The Company has no manufacturing capabilities and relies on third party manufacturers who are sole source suppliers for manufacturing of its products. The Company intends to rely on third-party manufacturers for the long-term commercial supply of FILSPARI and for its development stage product candidates, including sparsentan for the treatment of FSGS and pegtibatinase. The Company expects the manufacturers of each product or product candidate to, at least initially and potentially for a significant period of time, be single source suppliers to the Company.
Property and Equipment, net
Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the related estimated useful lives as presented in the table below. Significant additions and improvements are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Property and equipment purchased for specific research and development projects with no alternative use is expensed as incurred.

The major classifications of property and equipment, including their respective expected useful lives, consist of the following:
Computers and equipment

 years
Furniture and fixtures
7
 years
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of length of lease or life of the asset
Leases
The Company determines whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at inception. The Company classifies each of its leases as operating or financing considering factors such as the length of the lease term, the present value of the lease payments, the nature of the asset being leased, and the potential for ownership of the asset to transfer during the lease term. Leases with terms greater than one year are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Right-of-use assets and Lease liabilities and are measured at the present value of the fixed payments due over the expected lease term minus the present value of any incentives, rebates or abatement expected to be received from the lessor. Options to extend a lease are typically excluded from the expected lease term as the exercise of the option is typically not reasonably certain. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As such, the Company utilizes the appropriate incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis an amount equal to the lease payments over a similar term and in a similar economic environment. 
In addition to rent, the leases may require the Company to pay additional amounts for taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other expenses, which are generally referred to as non-lease components. The Company has elected to not separate lease and non-lease components. Only the fixed costs for lease components and their associated non-lease components are accounted for as a single lease component and recognized as part of the Right-of-use assets and Lease liabilities. The Company records expense to recognize fixed lease payments, including payment escalation, on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. Costs determined to be variable and not based on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and are expensed as incurred.
The Company has made an accounting policy election to not recognize short-term leases, or leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less at commencement date, within its Consolidated Balance Sheets and to recognize those lease payments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
The Company recognizes income from sublet office space on a straight-line basis over the term of the sublease, recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Intangible Assets, Net
The Company's intangible assets consist of licenses and purchased technology. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed periodically for impairment.
Intangible Assets with Cost Accumulation Model
In 2014, the Company entered into a license agreement with Mission Pharmacal ("Mission") in which the Company obtained the exclusive right to license the trademark of Thiola ("Mission License Agreement"). The acquisition of the Thiola license qualified as an asset acquisition under the principles of ASC 805, 
Business Combinations
 ("ASC 805") in effect at the time of acquisition. The license agreement requires the Company to make royalty payments based on net sales of Thiola. The liability for royalties in excess of the annual contractual minimum is recognized in the period in which the royalties become probable and estimable, which is typically in the period corresponding with the respective sales. The Company records an offsetting increase to the cost basis of the intangible asset under the cost accumulation model ("Thiola Intangible"). The additional cost basis is subsequently amortized over the remaining estimated useful life of the license agreement. 
In the second quarter of 2023, the Company reduced the estimated useful life of the Thiola Intangible to better reflect the pattern of projected future cash flows, resulting in incremental expense of $
3.7
 million recorded in 
selling, general, and administrative
. The change in estimated useful life was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and the remaining carrying amounts of the Thiola Intangible are being amortized prospectively over the new useful life. 
Consistent with all prior periods since Thiola was acquired, the Company has not accrued any liability for future royalties in excess of the annual contractual minimum at December 31, 2024 as such royalties are not yet probable and estimable.
In 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Ligand”) for a worldwide sublicense to develop, manufacture and commercialize sparsentan (the “Ligand License Agreement”). The acquisition of the Ligand License Agreement qualified as an asset acquisition under the principles of ASC 805 in effect at the time of acquisition. The license agreement requires the Company to make royalty payments based on net sales of FILSPARI (sparsentan) and milestone payments. The liabilities for royalties and milestone payments are recognized in the period in which they become probable and estimable, which is typically in the period corresponding with the respective sales or achievement of the milestone.

Variable Interest Entity
The Company reviews each investment and collaboration agreement to determine if it has a variable interest in the entity. In assessing whether the Company has a variable interest in the entity as a whole, the Company considers and makes judgments regarding the purpose and design of the entity, the value of the licensed assets to the entity, the value of the entity’s total assets and the significant activities of the entity. If the Company has a variable interest in the entity as a whole, the Company assesses whether or not the Company is a primary beneficiary of that VIE, based on a number of factors, including: (i) which party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance, (ii) the parties’ contractual rights and responsibilities pursuant to the collaboration agreement, and (iii) which party has the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. If the Company determines that it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE at the onset of the collaboration, the collaboration is treated as a business combination and the Company consolidates the financial statements of the VIE into the Company’s consolidated financial statements. On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates whether it continues to be the primary beneficiary of the consolidated VIE. If the Company determines that it is no longer the primary beneficiary of a consolidated VIE, it deconsolidates the VIE in the period in which the determination is made.
Assets and liabilities recorded as a result of consolidating the financial results of the VIE into the Company’s consolidated balance sheet do not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against the Company’s general assets or liabilities for which creditors have recourse to the Company’s general assets.
Equity Securities
The Company applies the equity method of accounting for investments when it has significant influence, but no controlling interest in the investee. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes key factors such as ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in joint steering committees and material intercompany transactions. Upon investment, the Company evaluates any basis difference between the carrying value and fair value of the Company's proportionate share of the investee's net assets. Basis differences relating to in-process research and development (IPR&D) are expensed when the investee is not considered a business as defined in ASC 805, 
Business Combinations, 
due to substantially all of the estimated fair value of the gross assets being concentrated in a group of similar IPR&D assets with no alternative future use. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $
3.4
 million in other (expense) income, net in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for these basis adjustments. The equity method investment's carrying value was reduced to 
zero
 as the Company's proportionate share of the basis difference exceeded the carrying value. See Note 5 for further discussion. Investments accounted for using the equity method are be reported on a lag of up to three months if the financial statements of the investee are not available in sufficient time for the Company to apply the equity method as of the current reporting date.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized. Goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment. The Company has 
one
 segment and 
one
 reporting unit and as such reviews goodwill for impairment at the consolidated level.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company's long-lived assets are primarily comprised of intangible assets, right-of-use assets, and property and equipment. The Company evaluates its finite-lived intangible assets, right-of-use assets, and property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. If these circumstances exist, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the use and eventual disposition of the asset group. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
In addition, indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired by comparing the fair value to the carrying value of the asset. To determine the fair value of the asset, the Company used the multi-period excess earnings method of the income approach. The more significant assumptions inherent in the application of this method include: the amount and timing of projected future cash flows (including revenue, cost of sales, research and development costs, and sales and marketing expenses), and the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows. See Note 8 for further discussion of certain long-lived assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when there are indicators of impairment.

Table of Contents
Income Taxes
The Company follows ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
 ("ASC 740"), which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized.
The standard addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under ASC 740, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. ASC 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company’s policy is to record estimated interest and penalty related to the underpayment of income taxes or unrecognized tax benefits as a component of its income tax provision.
Foreign Currency Translation
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each entity comprising the Company are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the functional currency).
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions in each entity comprising the Company are remeasured into the functional currency of the entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the respective transaction dates. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the remeasurement at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized within Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
An aggregate loss of $
0.7
 million arising from foreign exchange transactions is included in other (expense) income, net for the year ended December 31, 2024. An aggregate gain of $
0.5
 million and $
1.4
 million is included in other (expense) income, net for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The results and financial position of the Company that have a functional currency different from the U.S. dollar are translated as follows:
a.
assets and liabilities presented are translated at the closing exchange rate as of December 31, 2024 and 2023; 
b.
income and expenses for the statements of operations and comprehensive loss are translated at average exchange rates that are relevant for the respective periods for which the income and expenses occurred; and
c.
significant transactions use the exchange rate on the date of the transaction.
All resulting exchange differences arising from such translations are recognized directly in comprehensive income and presented as a separate component of equity.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements in order to conform to the current year’s presentation. These reclassifications did not have an impact on total assets or total liabilities and stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets or net loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Patents
The Company expenses external costs, such as filing fees and associated attorney fees, incurred to obtain issued patents and patent applications pending. The Company also expenses costs associated with maintaining and defending patents subsequent to their issuance in the period incurred.

Legal Contingencies
The Company may, from time to time, be involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues for legal contingencies when it is determined probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
 See Note 11 for further discussion.
Discontinued Operations
Discontinued operations is presented when there is a disposal of a component or a group of components that in the Company's judgment represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. Results of operations directly related to discontinued operations are aggregated into a single line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.
 See Note 19 for further discussion.
Restructuring
Restructuring charges consist primarily of employee severance, one-time termination benefits related to the reduction of its workforce, and other costs. Liabilities for costs associated with a restructuring activity are recognized when the liability is incurred and are measured at fair value. One-time termination benefits are expensed at the date the entity notifies the employee, unless the employee must provide future service, in which case the benefits are expensed ratably over the service period. Termination benefits are calculated based on regional benefit practices and local statutory requirements.
In December 2023, the Company initiated a restructuring plan that resulted in a reduction of its workforce, primarily impacting non-field-based employees. Restructuring costs were primarily comprised of one-time termination benefits, including severance, continuation of health insurance coverage, and other benefits for a specified period of time. In 2024, we also recognized charges for impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets and related leasehold improvements, as well as disposal costs on furniture and fixtures associated with available office space that the Company has sublet as a result of the reduction in occupancy. As of December 31, 2024, we are no longer incurring restructuring expenses. Of the $
13.8
 million recognized to date, $
2.4
 million was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024, including $
1.2
 million related to the impairment and disposal costs and initial direct costs to obtain the sublease.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.
 The FASB amended the guidance in ASC 280, 
Segment Reporting 
("ASC 280"), to require a public entity to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to provide the new disclosures and all the disclosures required under ASC 280. The guidance is applied retrospectively to all periods presented in financial statements, unless it is impracticable. This new guidance is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted this new standard effective
 December 31, 2024
. See Note 20, Segment Information, for disclosures related to the adoption of ASU 2023-07.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity. 
The ASU includes amendments to the guidance on convertible instruments and the derivative scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity in Subtopic 815-40 and simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments which include beneficial conversion features or cash conversion features by removing certain separation models in Subtopic 470-20. Additionally, the ASU requires entities to use the "if-converted" method when calculating diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments. The adoption of the new standard impacted the Company's accounting for its Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025 (2025 Notes), discussed in Note 7, which were previously accounted for using the cash conversion model applied under ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options ("ASC 470-20"). The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective method. The cumulative effect of the accounting change as of January 1, 2022 increased the carrying amount of the 2025 Notes by $
44.7
 million, reduced additional paid-in capital by $
74.9
 million, and reduced accumulated deficit by $
30.2
 million. 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") or other standard setting bodies. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations upon adoption.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-04, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20): Induced Conversions of Convertible Debts Instruments.
 This ASU clarifies the requirements for determining whether to account for certain early settlements of convertible debt instruments as induced conversions or extinguishments. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025, with early adoption permitted for entities that have adopted 2020-06. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on the accounting for the Company's convertible notes.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Recognition Disclosures.
 This ASU will require entities to provide enhanced disclosures related to certain expense categories included in income statement captions. The ASU aims to increase transparency and provide investors with more detailed information about the nature of expenses reported on the face of the income statement. The new standard does not change the requirements for the presentation of expenses on the face of the income statement. Under this ASU, entities are required to disaggregate, in a tabular format, expense captions presented on the face of the income statement — excluding earnings or losses from equity method investments — if they include any of the following expense categories: purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and depreciation or depletion. For any remaining items within each relevant expense caption, entities must provide a qualitative description of the nature of those expenses. The new ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on the related disclosures.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.
 This ASU does not change accounting for income taxes but requires new disclosures focusing on two areas, the effective rate reconciliation and taxes paid. This new standard is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on the related disclosures.

NOTE 3. 
REVENUE RECOGNITION
Product Sales, Net
Product sales consist of FILSPARI and tiopronin products (Thiola and Thiola EC). The Company sells its products to specialty pharmacies and through direct-to-patient distributors worldwide, with the United States representing over 
98
% of net product sales.
The Company sells FILSPARI to 
two
 direct-to-patient specialty pharmacies in the United States. The Company sells its tiopronin products to patients and pharmacies, with distribution facilitated through a single direct-to-patient distributor. Revenues from product sales are recognized in satisfaction of a single performance obligation when the customer obtains control of the Company’s product. 
For FILSPARI, sales are recognized upon delivery of the product to the specialty pharmacies. The Company receives payments from its FILSPARI sales based on terms that are generally 30 days from shipment of the product to the specialty pharmacy. For the Company's tiopronin products, product sales are recognized upon delivery to the patient. The Company receives payments from sales of its tiopronin products, primarily through third party payers, based on terms that generally are within 30 days of delivery of product to the patient
. Contracts do not contain significant financing components based on the typical period of time between performance of services and collection of consideration.
Deductions from Revenue
Revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price, which includes provisions resulting from discounts, rebates and co-pay assistance that are offered to customers, payers and other indirect customers relating to the Company’s sales of its products. These provisions are based on the estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These amounts are treated as variable consideration, estimated and recognized as a reduction of the transaction price at the time of the sale, using the most likely amount method, and are classified as a reduction of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to a customer) or as a current liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than a customer). The Company includes these estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized for such transactions will not occur. Where appropriate, these reserves take into consideration the Company’s historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements and specific known market events and trends. Overall, these reserves reflect the Company’s best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the contract. If actual results in the future vary from the Company’s provisions, the Company will adjust the estimate, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, adjustments to net product revenue related to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods were $
0.5
 million, $
0.4
 million, and $
0.2
 million, respectively.
Government Rebates:
 The Company calculates the rebates that it will be obligated to provide to government programs and deducts these estimated amounts from its gross product sales at the time the revenues are recognized. Allowances for government rebates and discounts are established based on an estimated allocation of payers and the government-mandated discounts applicable to government-funded programs. Rebate discounts are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Commercial Rebates: 
The Company

calculates the rebates it incurs according to any contracts with certain commercial payers and deducts these amounts from its gross product sales at the time the revenues are recognized. Allowances for commercial rebates are established based on actual payer information, which is reasonably estimated at the time of delivery for applicable products. Rebate discounts are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Prompt Pay Discounts: 
The Company offers discounts to certain customers for prompt payments. The Company accrues for the calculated prompt pay discount based on the gross amount of each invoice for those customers at the time of sale.
Other Fees:
 The Company pays service fees to certain customers based on a contractually fixed percentage of the wholesale acquisition cost and fees for data. Other fees are recorded as an offset to revenue based on contractual terms at the time revenue from the sale is recognized. 
Product Returns:
 Consistent with industry practice, the Company offers its customers a limited right to return product purchased directly from the Company, which is principally based upon the product’s expiration date. Historically, returns have been immaterial.
Co-pay Assistance: 
The Company offers a co-pay assistance program, which is intended to provide financial assistance to qualified commercially insured patients with prescription drug co-payments required by payers. The calculation of the accrual for co-pay assistance is based on an estimate of claims and the estimated cost per claim associated with product that has been recognized as revenue.

NOTE 4. 
COLLABORATION AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS
License Agreement with CSL Vifor
In September 2021, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement (“License Agreement”) with Vifor (International) Ltd. (“CSL Vifor”), pursuant to which the Company granted an exclusive license to CSL Vifor for the commercialization of sparsentan in Europe, Australia and New Zealand ("Licensed Territories"). CSL Vifor also has first right of negotiation to expand the licensed territories into Canada, China, Brazil and/ or Mexico. Under the terms of the License Agreement, the Company received an upfront payment of $
55.0
 million and will be eligible for up to $
135.0
 million in aggregate regulatory and market access related milestone payments and up to $
655.0
 million in aggregate sales-based milestone payments for a total potential value of up to $
845.0
 million. The Company is also entitled to receive tiered double-digit royalties of up to 
40
 percent of annual net sales of sparsentan in the Licensed Territories.
Under the License Agreement, CSL Vifor is responsible for all commercialization activities in the Licensed Territories. The Company remains responsible for the worldwide clinical development of sparsentan through regulatory approval as defined and will retain all rights to sparsentan in the United States and rest of world outside of the Licensed Territories. Development costs for any post regulatory approval development activities, subject to approval by both parties, will be borne by the Company and CSL Vifor as defined, respectively. The License Agreement will remain in effect, unless terminated earlier, until the expiration of all royalty terms for sparsentan in the licensed territories. Each party has the right to terminate the License Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach, insolvency or if the time required for performance under the License Agreement by the other party is extended due to a force majeure event that continues for 
six months
 or more.
The Company assessed the License Agreement and determined that it meets both criteria to be considered a collaborative agreement within the Scope of ASC 808, 
Collaborative Arrangements
 of active participation by both parties and exposures to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. Both parties participate on joint steering and other committees overseeing the collaboration activities. Also, both parties are exposed to significant risks and rewards based on the economic outcomes of regulatory approvals and commercialization of sparsentan. 
The Company determined the transaction price under the License Agreement totaled $
55.0
 million, consisting of the fixed non-refundable upfront payment. The variable regulatory and access related milestones were excluded from the transaction price given the substantial uncertainty related to their achievement. Sales-based milestone payments and royalties on net sales were excluded from the transaction price and are recognized at the later of when the related sales occur or when the performance obligation to which the sales-based milestone or royalty has been allocated have been satisfied.
The Company concluded that CSL Vifor represented a customer and applied relevant guidance from ASC 606 to evaluate the accounting under the License Agreement. In accordance with this guidance, the Company concluded that the promise to grant the license is distinct from the promise to provide clinical development services resulting in 
two
 performance obligations. As a result, the Company allocated $
12.0
 million of the transaction price, based on the performance obligations' relative standalone selling prices, to the license, which was recognized in full in 2021. The remaining $
43.0
 million of the transaction price was allocated to the clinical development activities and recorded as deferred revenue, which are being recognized over the development period based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs. 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $
5.8
 million in license and collaboration revenue for clinical development activities, based upon the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs, and $
0.6
 million for royalties earned in 2024 on net sales of FILSPARI in the CSL Vifor Licensed Territories following the August 2024 launch. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized a total of $
17.7
 million in license and collaboration revenue, which consisted of $
3.3
 million from the sale of active pharmaceutical ingredients to CSL Vifor, and $
14.4
 million for clinical development activities, based upon the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs. A decrease in total costs for clinical development activities due to the restructuring announced in December 2023 resulted in a $
2.9
 million increase in amortization of deferred revenue under the cost-to-cost model for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Deferred revenue related to the clinical development activities as of December 31, 2024 was $
2.8
 million, classified as current as the Company estimates that the remainder of the deferred revenue balance will be fully realized by mid-2025. As of December 31, 2023, deferred revenue related 
F-22
Table of Contents
to the clinical development activities was $
8.9
 million, of which $
7.1
 million was classified as current. The $
1.8
 million classified as non-current as of December 31, 2023 is included in other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Licensing Agreement with Renalys
In January 2024, the license agreement (“Renalys License Agreement”) between the Company and Renalys Pharma, Inc. (“Renalys”) came into effect.  Pursuant to the terms of the Renalys License Agreement, the Company granted an exclusive license to Renalys for the development and commercialization of sparsentan in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and other specified Asian countries ("Renalys Licensed Territories"). Under the terms of the Renalys License Agreement, the Company received a non-refundable upfront payment and will be eligible to receive up to $
120.0
 million in aggregate development and sales-based milestones. The Company is also entitled to receive tiered double-digit to mid-20 percent royalties of annual net sales of sparsentan in the Renalys Licensed Territories. In addition, the Company received an option to purchase shares of common stock of Renalys (“Option Agreement”), which it exercised in January 2024. The Company also has the option to purchase all equity securities of Renalys at any time prior to the top-line results of the Phase 3 trial in Japan (“Buyout Right”).
Under the Renalys License Agreement, Renalys will be responsible for all development and commercialization activities in the Renalys Licensed Territories. The Renalys License Agreement will remain in effect, unless terminated earlier, until the expiration of all royalty terms for sparsentan in the Renalys Licensed Territories. Each party has the right to terminate the Renalys License Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency, or if the time required for performance under the Renalys License Agreement by the other party is extended due to a force majeure event that continues for 
nine months
 or more. Renalys may terminate the Renalys License Agreement for any reason upon prior written notice to the Company. The Company may terminate the Renalys License Agreement if Renalys abandons development in Japan or South Korea prior to first commercial sales of sparsentan in either Japan or South Korea.
The Company concluded that Renalys represents a customer and applied relevant guidance from ASC 606 to evaluate the accounting under the Renalys License Agreement. 
The Company determined the transaction price under the Renalys License Agreement totaled $
8.3
 million, consisting of the fixed non-refundable upfront payment, milestone payment and estimated fair value of the Option Agreement. The variable development-related milestones were excluded from the transaction price given the substantial uncertainty related to their achievement. Sales-based milestone payments and royalties on net sales were excluded from the initial transaction price and will be recognized at the later of when the related sales occur or when the performance obligation to which the sales-based milestone or royalty has been allocated has been satisfied.
In accordance with ASC 606, the Company concluded that the promise to grant the license is distinct, resulting in 
one
 performance obligation as the license has stand-alone functionally at contract inception. The Buyout Right precludes transferring control of the license to Renalys under ASC 606 and the Company’s option to repurchase the common stock at a price greater than the original license premium results in accounting for the Renalys License Agreement as a financing arrangement. The transaction price was recorded in other current liabilities, and will be recognized in revenue upon termination of the Buyout Right. 
See Note 5 for further discussion of VIE’s.

0.6
 million in cash to purchase 
5
% of the outstanding common shares of PharmaKrysto and $
0.4
 million to PharmaKrysto as a one-time signing fee. Under the Collaboration Agreement, the Company will fund all research and development expenses for the pre-clinical activities 
F-23
Table of Contents
associated with the cystinuria program, which are estimated to be approximately $
5.0
 million. The Agreements require the Company to purchase an additional 
5
% of the outstanding common shares for $
1.0
 million upon the occurrence of a specified pre-clinical milestone, and granted an option to the Company to purchase the remaining outstanding shares of PharmaKrysto for $
5.0
 million upon the occurrence of a subsequent pre-clinical milestone prior to expiration of the option on March 8, 2025. If the Company elects to exercise the option, it would be required to perform commercially reasonable clinical diligence obligations. In addition, it would be required to make cash milestone payments totaling up to an aggregate $
16.0
 million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones, plus tiered royalty payments of less than 
4
% on future net sales of a product, if approved. The Company has the right to terminate the Agreements and return the shares for a nominal price at any time upon 
60
 days’ notice, subject to survival of contingent obligations, if any.
The Company determined that PharmaKrysto is a VIE because it lacks the resources to conduct the cystinuria clinical program and the limitation on the residual returns through the Company's option to purchase the remaining outstanding shares. The Company further concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE due to the Company's ultimate control over the research and development program, and its obligation, subject to continuation of the collaboration, to fund 
100
% of research and development costs of the program pursuant to the terms of the Collaboration Agreement.
The upfront payments were expensed to research and development and other income (expense), net upon initial consolidation. The consolidated assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were immaterial. The results of operations were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The Company is not required to provide additional funding other than the contractually required amounts disclosed above. The creditors and beneficial holders of PharmaKrysto have no recourse to the general credit or assets of the Company.
Licensing Agreement with Renalys
In January 2024, the Renalys License Agreement between the Company and Renalys came into effect and the Company exercised its option to purchase shares of common stock of Renalys. The Company determined that Renalys is a VIE as they could require additional funding to support development and commercial activities. The Company has variable interests in Renalys, including an equity interest, Buyout Right and performance-related payments under the Renalys License Agreement that absorb variability from the performance of Renalys.
In order to determine the primary beneficiary of Renalys, the Company evaluated its variable interest to identify if the Company had the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance. Based upon the capital structure, governing documents and overall business operations, the Company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary as it does do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Renalys and does not have an obligation to absorb losses.
As of December 31, 2024, the carrying amount of the liabilities related to the Company’s variable interests was $
8.9
 million, recorded in other current liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as of December 31, 2024 is 
zero
. The Company is not required to provide additional funding. The creditors have no recourse to the general credit or assets of the Company.

During 2024 and 2023, realized gains and losses on marketable debt securities were immaterial. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the accrued interest receivable related to the Company's marketable debt securities was $
2.3
 million and $
4.6
 million, respectively, and was recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company reviews the available-for-sale marketable debt securities for declines in fair value below the cost basis each quarter. For any security whose fair value is below its amortized cost basis, the Company first evaluates whether it intends to sell the impaired security, or will otherwise be more likely than not required to sell the security before recovery. If either are true, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value at the reporting date. If neither circumstance holds true, the Company assesses whether any portion of the unrealized loss is a result of a credit loss. Any amount deemed to be attributable to credit loss is recognized in the income statement, with the amount of the loss limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost and recorded as an allowance for credit losses. The portion of the unrealized loss related to factors other than credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive loss.

As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amortized cost of the available-for-sale marketable debt securities in an unrealized loss position was $
123.7
 million and $
269.7
 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company does not intend to sell these investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis. The decrease in unrealized losses for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to fluctuations in short-term interest rates. The Company does not believe the unrealized losses incurred during the period are due to credit-related factors. The credit ratings of the securities held remain of the highest quality. Moreover, the Company continues to receive payments of interest and principal as they become due, and our expectation is that those payments will continue to be received timely. Factors unknown to us at this time may cause actual results to differ and require adjustments to the Company’s estimates and assumptions in the future.

Convertible Senior Notes Due 2029
On March 11, 2022, the Company completed a registered underwritten public offering of $
316.3
 million aggregate principal amount of 
2.25
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (“2029 Notes”), which includes $
41.3
 million aggregate principal amount of 2029 Notes sold pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional 2029 Notes. The Company issued the 2029 Notes under an indenture, dated as of September 10, 2018, as supplemented by the second supplemental indenture, dated as of March 11, 2022 (collectively, the “2029 Indenture”). The 2029 Notes will mature on March 1, 2029, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted. The 2029 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at an annual rate of 
2.25
%, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on September 1, 2022.
The Company received net proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes of $
306.4
 million, after deducting commissions and offering expenses of $
9.9
 million. At December 31, 2024, accrued interest on the 2029 Notes of $
2.4
 million is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The 2029 Notes comprise the Company’s senior, unsecured obligations and are (i) equal in right of payment with the Company’s existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the 2029 Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables.
F-26
Table of Contents
Holders may convert their 2029 Notes at their option only in the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on June 30, 2022 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock for each of at least 
20
 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price on the applicable trading day; (2) during the 
five
 consecutive business days immediately after any 
10
 consecutive trading day period (such 
10
 consecutive trading day period, the “measurement period”) if the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2029 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; (3) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions of the Company’s common stock; (4) if the Company calls the 2029 Notes for redemption; and (5) at any time from, and including, December 1, 2028 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s election, based on the applicable conversion rate. The initial conversion rate for the 2029 Notes is 31.3740 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2029 Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $
31.87
 per share. If a “make-whole fundamental change” (as defined in the 2029 Indenture) occurs, then the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a specified period of time.
The 2029 Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part at the Company’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after March 2, 2026 and, in the case of any partial redemption, on or before the 
40
th scheduled trading day before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price on (1) each of at least 
20
 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends the related redemption notice; and (2) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such notice. However, the Company may not redeem less than all of the outstanding 2029 Notes unless at least $
100.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 2029 Notes are outstanding and not called for redemption as of the time the Company sends the related redemption notice. In addition, calling any 2029 Note for redemption will constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to that 2029 Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that 2029 Note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption. If a fundamental change (as defined in the 2029 Indenture) occurs, then, except as described in the 2029 Indenture, holders may require the Company to repurchase their 2029 Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In the event of conversion, holders would forgo all future interest payments, any unpaid accrued interest and the possibility of further stock price appreciation. Upon the receipt of conversion requests, the settlement of the 2029 Notes will be paid pursuant to the terms of the 2029 Indenture. In the event that all of the 2029 Notes are converted, the Company would be required to repay the principal amount and any conversion premium in any combination of cash and shares of its common stock at the Company’s option. In addition, calling the 2029 Notes for redemption will constitute a “make-whole fundamental change."
The Company incurred approximately $
9.9
 million of debt issuance costs relating to the issuance of the 2029 Notes, which were recorded as a reduction to the 2029 Notes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt issuance costs are being amortized and recognized as additional interest expense over the expected life of the 2029 Notes using the effective interest method. We determined the expected life of the debt is equal to the 
seven-year
 term of the 2029 Notes. The effective interest rate on the 2029 Notes is 
2.74
%.
Convertible Senior Notes Due 2025
On September 10, 2018, the Company completed a registered underwritten public offering of $
276.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
2.50
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 ("2025 Notes"), and entered into a base indenture and supplemental indenture agreement ("2025 Indenture") with respect to the 2025 Notes. The 2025 Notes will mature on September 15, 2025, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted. The 2025 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at an annual rate of 
2.50
%, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2019.
The net proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 Notes were approximately $
267.2
 million, after deducting commissions and the offering expenses of $
8.8
 million payable by the Company. At December 31, 2024, accrued interest of $
0.5
 million is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The 2025 Notes comprise the Company’s senior, unsecured obligations and are (i) equal in right of payment with the Company’s existing and future senior, unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the 2025 Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, including trade payables.
Holders may convert their 2025 Notes at their option only in the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on December 31, 2018 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock for each of at least 
20
 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price on the applicable trading day; (2) during the 
five
 consecutive business days immediately after any 
10
 consecutive trading day period (“measurement period”) if the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; (3) upon the occurrence of certain 
F-27
Table of Contents
corporate events or distributions on the Company’s common stock; (4) if the Company calls the 2025 Notes for redemption; and (5) at any time from, and including, May 15, 2025 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at the Company’s election, based on the applicable conversion rate.
The initial conversion rate for the 2025 Notes is 25.7739 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2025 Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $
38.80
 per share. If a “make-whole fundamental change” (as defined in the 2025 Indenture) occurs, then the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a specified period of time.
The 2025 Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the Company’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after September 15, 2022 and, in the case of any partial redemption, on or before the 40th scheduled trading day before the maturity date, at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the 2025 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price on each of at least 
20
 trading days during the 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends the related redemption notice. If a fundamental change (as defined in the 2025 Indenture) occurs, then, subject to certain exceptions, holders may require the Company to repurchase their 2025 Notes at a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the 2025 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In the event of conversion, holders would forgo all future interest payments, any unpaid accrued interest and the possibility of further stock price appreciation. Upon the receipt of conversion requests, the settlement of the 2025 Notes will be paid pursuant to the terms of the 2025 Indenture. In the event that all of the 2025 Notes are converted, the Company would be required to repay the principal amount and any conversion premium in any combination of cash and shares of its common stock at the Company’s option. In addition, calling the 2025 Notes for redemption will constitute a “make-whole fundamental change."
The Company incurred approximately $
8.8
 million of debt issuance costs relating to the issuance of the 2025 Notes, which were recorded as a reduction to the 2025 Notes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The debt issuance costs are being amortized and recognized as additional interest expense over the expected life of the 2025 Notes using the effective interest method. The Company determined the expected life of the debt is equal to the 
seven-year
 term of the 2025 Notes. The effective interest rate on the 2025 Notes is 
2.98
%.
On March 11, 2022, the Company completed its repurchase of $
207.1
 million aggregate principal amount of 2025 Notes for cash, including accrued and unpaid interest, for a total of $
213.8
 million. This transaction involved a contemporaneous exchange of cash between the Company and holders of the 2025 Notes participating in the issuance of the 2029 Notes. Accordingly, we evaluated the transaction for modification or extinguishment accounting in accordance with ASC 470-50, 
Debt – Modifications and Extinguishments
 on a creditor-by creditor basis depending on whether the exchange was determined to have substantially different terms. The repurchase of the 2025 Notes and issuance of the 2029 Notes were deemed to have substantially different terms based on the present value of the cash flows or significant difference between the value of the conversion option immediately prior to and after the exchange. Therefore, the repurchase of the 2025 Notes was accounted for as a debt extinguishment. The Company recorded a $
7.6
 million loss on extinguishment of debt on its Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, which included the write-off of related deferred financing costs of $
3.4
 million. After giving effect to the repurchase, and as of December 31, 2024, the total remaining principal amount outstanding under the 2025 Notes was $
68.9
 million.
The 2025 and 2029 Notes are accounted for in accordance with ASC 470-20, 
Debt with conversion and Other Options
 (“ASC 470-20”) and ASC 815-40, 
Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity
 (“ASC 815-40”). Under ASC 815-40, to qualify for equity classification (or nonbifurcation, if embedded) the instrument (or embedded feature) must be both (1) indexed to the issuer’s stock and (2) meet the requirements of equity classification guidance. Based upon the Company’s analysis, it was determined that the 2025 Notes and the 2029 Notes do not contain embedded features requiring recognition as derivatives and bifurcation, and therefore are measured at amortized cost and recorded as liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The 2025 and 2029 Notes do not contain any financial or operating covenants or any restrictions on the payment of dividends, the issuance of other indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company. There were no events of default for the 2025 Notes or 2029 Notes at December 31, 2024.
The 2025 and 2029 Notes are classified on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2024 as short-term and long-tern convertible debt, respectively.

NOTE 8.    
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The Company utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:
Level 1
 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;
Level 2
 – Quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; and
Level 3
 – Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.
The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt securities and all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Based on the fair value hierarchy, the Company classified marketable debt securities within Level 2.
Financial instruments with carrying values approximating fair value include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, due to their short-term nature. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's 
2.50
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 was $
68.2
 million and $
58.3
 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's 
2.25
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029, which were issued in 2022, was $
302.1
 million and $
212.1
 million, respectively. The fair values were estimated utilizing market quotations and are considered Level 2.

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
The Company’s long-lived assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when there are indicators of impairment and a loss is recognized. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded impairment charges of $
1.2
 million on right-of-use assets, property and equipment, and other capitalized assets as the fair value of the asset group was less than their carrying value. The fair value of the asset group was determined under the income approach based on projected future cash flows from the operating sublease discounted by a risk adjusted rate of 
6.9
%. The Company classified the fair value of the asset group as Level 3. See Note 18 for further discussion.
NOTE 9.    
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Amortizable Intangible Assets
Ligand License Agreement
In 2012, the Company entered into the Ligand License Agreement with Ligand for a worldwide sublicense to develop, manufacture and commercialize sparsentan. As consideration for the license, the Company is required to make substantial payments upon the achievement of certain milestones, totaling up to $
114.1
 million. Through December 31, 2024, the Company has capitalized $
47.2
 million for contractual milestones achieved under the Ligand License Agreement, including $
5.8
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Pursuant to the Ligand License Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay to Ligand (and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ("BMS")) an escalating royalty between 
15
% and 
17
% of net sales of sparsentan, with payments due quarterly. The Company began incurring costs associated with such royalties following the February 2023 approval of FILSPARI (sparsentan). For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company capitalized $
20.3
 million and $
4.4
 million, respectively, to intangible assets for royalties owed on net sales of FILSPARI. The cost of the milestone payments and royalty payments are being amortized to selling, general and administration on a straight-line basis through April 30, 2033
Mission License Agreement
In 2014, the Company entered into the Mission License Agreement with Mission in which the Company obtained an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to market, sell and commercialize Thiola (tiopronin) in the United States and Canada, and a non-exclusive license to use know-how relating to Thiola to the extent necessary to market Thiola. The initial term of the license was 
10
 years.
The Company paid Mission an up-front license fee of $
3.0
 million and during the term of the agreement will pay the greater of $
2.0
 million, representing the guaranteed minimum royalty, or 
20
% of the Company’s net sales of Thiola during each calendar year. 
In November 2017, the Company amended its agreement with Mission to extend the term of the current exclusive U.S. and Canada licensing agreement by an additional 
five years
, to 2029. The royalty rate and guaranteed minimum payment were also extended through the new agreement term. Upon execution of the amendment, the Company capitalized an additional $
5.9
 million in intangible assets and recorded a guaranteed minimum liability for the same amount.
In November 2018, the Company amended its agreement with Mission to remove all territorial restrictions on our license. As consideration for the expanded territory, the Company paid an up-front fee of $
0.3
 million and will pay the greater of $
0.1
 million, representing the guaranteed minimum, or 
20
% of the Company's net sales of Thiola generated outside of the United States during each calendar year. Upon execution of the amendment, the Company capitalized an additional $
1.0
 million in intangible assets and recorded a guaranteed minimum liability of $
0.7
 million related to this amendment.
F-30
Table of Contents
The present value of guaranteed minimum royalties payable using a discount rate ranging from approximately 
7
% to 
11
% based on the Company’s then borrowing rate is $
8.2
 million and $
9.7
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the guaranteed minimum royalty current and long-term liability was approximately $
2.1
 million and $
6.1
 million, respectively, and is recorded as Other Liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023, the guaranteed minimum royalty current and long-term liability was approximately $
2.1
 million and $
7.6
 million, respectively, and is recorded as Other Liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
The Company has capitalized $
171.0
 million related to the Thiola intangible asset which consists of the up-front license fee, professional fees, present value of the guaranteed minimum royalties and any additional payment obligations through December 31, 2024 in excess of minimum royalties. In 2024 the Company added $
15.4
 million to the intangible asset related to royalties in excess of the minimum. Consistent with all prior periods since Thiola was acquired, the Company has not accrued any liability for royalties in excess of the annual contractual minimum at December 31, 2024, as such royalties are not yet probable and estimable.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Commitments
Certain of the Company's contractual arrangements with contract manufacturing organizations ("CMOs") require binding forecasts or commitments to purchase minimum amounts for the manufacture of drug product supply, which may be material to the Company's financial statements.
Contingencies
In November 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Orphan Technologies Limited (“Orphan”), including Orphan’s rare metabolic disorder drug pegtibatinase. The Company acquired Orphan by purchasing all of the outstanding shares. Under the Agreement, the Company has also agreed to make contingent cash payments up to an aggregate of $
427.0
 million based on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercialization events as set forth in the Agreement, as well as additional tiered mid-single digit royalty payments based upon future net sales of any pegtibatinase products in the U.S. and Europe, subject to certain reductions as set forth in the Agreement, and a contingent payment in the event a pediatric rare disease voucher for any pegtibatinase product is granted. 
In accordance with ASC 450, 
Contingencies
, contingent cash payments will be accrued for when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In March 2024, the Company recognized $
65.2
 million in IPR&D expense upon the achievement of a development milestone, which was paid during the second quarter of 2024 and recorded within investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of December 31, 2024, no contingent cash payments have been accrued.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time in the normal course of business, the Company is subject to various legal matters such as threatened or pending claims or litigation. Although the results of claims and litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe it is a party to any claim or litigation in which the outcome, if determined adversely to it, would individually or in the aggregate be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition.

2018 Equity Incentive Plan
The Company's 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2018 Plan") is the successor to and continuation of the Company's 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2015 Plan") and the Company's 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan", and together with the 2015 Plan, the "Prior Plans"). Unallocated shares under the Prior Plans are no longer available for issuance under the Prior Plans, and have instead been added to the shares available for issuance under the 2018 Plan. The 2018 Plan, as amended, and including the unallocated shares of the Prior Plans, provides for a total of 
18.4
 million shares to be issued, plus the Prior Plans' returning shares, if any, which become available for grant under the 2018 Plan from time to time. Options issued under the 2018 Plan will generally expire 
ten years
 from the date of grant and vest over a 
four-year
 period. As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately 
5.7
 million shares reserved for future issuance under the 2018 Plan.
2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("2017 ESPP") originated with 
380,000
 shares of common stock available for issuance. Beginning on January 1, 2018, and ending on (and including) January 1, 2026, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2017 ESPP may increase by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) one percent (
1
%) of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31st of the preceding calendar year or (ii) 
300,000
 shares of common stock. 
Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the 2017 ESPP and, through payroll deductions, can purchase shares on established dates semi-annually. The purchase price per share sold pursuant to the 2017 ESPP will be the lower of (i) 
85
% of the fair market value of common stock on the first day of the offering period or (ii) 
85
% of the fair market value on the purchase date. Each offering period will span up to 
six months
. Purchases may be up to 
15
% of qualified compensation, with an annual limit of $
25,000
. The 2017 ESPP is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately 
2,480,000
 shares authorized and 
1,004,889
 shares reserved for future issuance under the 2017 ESPP.
Stock Options
The fair values of stock option grants during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were calculated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Compensation expense is recognized over the period of service, generally the vesting period. 
The following weighted average assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes options pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options for the specified reporting periods:

The risk-free interest rate was based on rates established by the Federal Reserve. The Company’s expected volatility was based on analysis of the Company’s historical volatility. The expected life of the Company’s options was determined using the Company's historical exercise activity. The dividend yield is based upon the fact that the Company has not historically paid dividends and does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.

2.4
 years.
In connection with the retirement of the Company's former Chief Financial Officer, the Board of Directors approved a modification to extend the deadline to exercise each stock option held to the earlier of three months following the last vesting date or the original expiration date of the option, and to continue vesting on the original schedule of any underlying unvested stock options and restricted stock units. The modification resulted in incremental compensation cost of $

NOTE 13.    
NET LOSS PER COMMON SHARE
Basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. In accordance with 
ASC 260, Earnings per Share
, if a company had a discontinued operation, the company uses income from continuing operations, adjusted for preferred dividend and similar adjustments, as its control number to determine whether potential common shares are dilutive.
As discussed in Note 15, as part of its February 2023 underwritten public offering, the Company issued and sold pre-funded warrants to purchase 
1.25
 million shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $
20.9999
 per pre-funded warrant. The pre-funded warrants were immediately exercisable upon issuance, and were exercised in the third quarter of 2024, resulting in the issuance of 
1.25
 million shares of the Company's common stock. Due to the nominal exercise price of the pre-funded warrants and the lack of any contingencies to exercise, the shares underlying the pre-funded warrants have been included in the calculation of basic net loss per common share since the date the warrants were issued.
The Company’s potentially dilutive shares, which include outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, performance-based stock units, and shares issuable upon conversion of the 2025 Notes and 2029 Notes, are considered to be common stock equivalents and are not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per share because their effect is anti-dilutive.

The Company has established a full valuation allowance against its U.S. federal, state, and foreign deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets in future periods. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred liabilities and tax planning strategies in making this assessment and evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets as of each reporting date. At such time as it is determined that it is more likely than not that deferred assets are realizable, the valuation allowance will be reduced accordingly and recorded as a tax benefit. 
F-37
Table of Contents
The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $
344.2
 million as of December 31, 2024 to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized. The Company increased its valuation allowance by $
53.5
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a $
2.7
 million decrease for the year ended December 31, 2023.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had available unused U.S. federal and state net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of $
223.8
 million and $
241.8
 million, respectively, all of which are fully offset by a valuation allowance. The federal NOL has an indefinite life. The state NOL carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025 unless previously utilized, except for $
45.4
 million of the state net operating losses that have an indefinite carryforward period. In addition, at December 31, 2024, the Company had federal orphan drug tax credit carryforwards of $
104.1
 million that begin to expire in 2035 unless utilized, federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of $
4.9
 million that begin to expire in 2033 unless utilized, state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $
1.4
 million that begin to expire in 2030 unless utilized and $
9.9
 million that have an indefinite carryforward period, and California Competes tax credit carryforwards of $
1.6
 million that begin to expire in 2025. Pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383, use of the Company’s federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited upon a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% within a three-year period. The Company continues to monitor potential historical ownership changes. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had Irish NOL carryforwards of $
14.2
 million which are fully offset by a valuation allowance and have an indefinite life. The Company also had Swiss NOL carryforwards of $
359.1
 million which are fully offset by a valuation allowance and begin to expire in 2025, as well as Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (“TRAF”) cantonal tax benefits of $
526.2
 million which expire in 2029.
The Company accounts for uncertain tax benefits in accordance with the provisions of ASC 740-10 of the 
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
27.4
 million in unrecognized tax benefits, which were recorded as a reduction to the deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction in the Company’s valuation allowance of $
27.4
 million. To the extent unrecognized tax benefits are recognized at a time when a valuation allowance does not exist, the recognition of the $
27.4
 million tax benefit would reduce the effective tax rate. The Company does not anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024 will change materially within the following 12 months.
A reconciliation of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits for the years 2024, 2023 and 2022 is provided in the following table (

NOTE 18. 
LEASES
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had operating leases, including one operating lease with Kilroy Realty, L.P. (the "Landlord") for office space located in San Diego, California, which was entered into in April 2019 and subsequently amended in May 2020. Coinciding with the Company's ability to direct the use of the office space and utilizing a discount rate equal to the Company's estimated incremental borrowing rate, the Company established right-of-use assets totaling $
34.6
 million and lease liabilities totaling $
34.5
 million. The total right-of-use asset and lease liability at measurement were each offset by lease incentives associated with tenant improvement allowances totaling $
7.9
 million. 
The initial term of the office lease ends in August 2028, and the Landlord has granted the Company an option to extend the term of the lease by a period of 
5
 years. At lease inception, it was not reasonably certain that the Company will extend the term of the lease and therefore the renewal period has been excluded from the aforementioned right-of-use asset and lease liability measurements. The measurement of the lease term occurs from the February 2021 occupancy date of the office space. 
F-39
Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2024, the Company also had an operating lease with Esprit Investments Limited for office space located in Dublin, Ireland, which was entered into in October 2022. The initial term of the office lease ends in September 2027. The lease provides the option to extend the term of the lease by a period of 
5
 years, although at lease inception, it was not reasonably certain that the Company will elect this option and therefore the renewal period has been excluded from the initial lease measurement. Utilizing a discount rate equal to the Company's borrowing rate, the Company established a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability of $
0.4
 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, due to the decreased occupancy from the 2023 restructuring along with efforts to optimize a hybrid work model, the Company decided to reduce its use of office space located in San Diego, California. In November 2024, the Company entered into a sublease of its 5th floor premises. The term of the sublease runs from January 2025 through August 2028.
The Company’s sublease arrangement has been classified as an operating lease with sublease income recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the sublease arrangement. To measure the Company’s periodic sublease income, the Company elected to use a practical expedient under ASC 842 to aggregate non-lease components with the related lease components when (i) the timing and pattern of transfer for the non-lease components and the related lease components are the same and (ii) the lease components, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease. 
Given the circumstances surrounding the 5th floor premises, the Company identified an indicator of impairment of the related operating lease right-of-use assets, property and equipment, and other capitalized assets and compared the carrying value of the asset group to an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the sublease and eventual disposition of the asset group. The sum of the undiscounted cash flows of the asset group was below the carrying value. Consequently, the Company utilized the present value of the estimated future cash flows attributable to the assets to determine the fair value of the asset group. The resulting fair value of the operating lease right-of-use assets, property and equipment, and other capitalized assets resulted in an impairment of $
1.2
 million recorded in restructuring expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and categorized the aforementioned measurement of fair value as Level 3 within the ASC Topic 820, "Fair Value Measurements" fair value hierarchy. There were 
no
 impairments related to right-of-use assets or property and equipment in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

DIVESTITURES
Discontinued Operations
Sale of Bile Acid Product Portfolio
On August 31, 2023, the Company closed the sale of its bile acid business to Mirum Pharmaceuticals pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement dated July 16, 2023 between the Company and Mirum. The assets sold consisted of substantially all of the assets primarily related to the Company’s business of development, manufacture (including synthesis, formulation, finishing or packaging) and commercialization of the products, Chenodal and Cholbam (also known as Kolbam). In connection with the Closing, the Company received an upfront cash payment of $
210.0
 million.
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, after the Closing, the Company is eligible to receive up to $
235.0
 million upon the achievement of certain milestones based on specified amounts of annual net sales (tiered from $
125.0
 million to $
500.0
 million) of the Products. The Company will recognize the contingent consideration receivable in earnings when the target annual sales for the milestones are met and the contingency is resolved. 
The Company's sale of the bile acid business resulted in a gain, net of tax, of $
226.0
 million, which was recognized in 2023. The net gain consists of net consideration, including the upfront payment and the deduction of investment banker fees owed upon the Closing, plus the derecognition of the carrying value of the net liabilities included in the transaction and the immaterial tax due on the sale.
The Company and Mirum have also entered into a transition services agreement ("TSA") pursuant to which the Company has agreed to perform certain services for a period of time following the Closing, with respect to Mirum’s use and operation of the assets purchased in the Purchase Agreement. The TSA is designed to ensure and facilitate an orderly transfer of business operations, and the consideration to be received by the Company primarily consists of cost reimbursement. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $
0.5
 million and $
1.0
 million, respectively, under the TSA, included in continuing operations within other income (expense), net. As of December 31, 2024, the Company collected $
1.5
 million. The uncollected balance is included in accounts receivable of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As part of the TSA, the Company is collecting certain receivables related to purchased assets for a period of time and remitting them to Mirum. The transition services accrual as of December 31, 2024 was $
0.3
 million, and is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. TSA services provided by the Company are substantially complete as of December 31, 2024.
The Company determined that the divestiture represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results, and has therefore reflected the bile acid business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.

SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company operates in 
one
 business segment focused on identifying, developing and delivering life-changing therapies to people living with rare kidney and metabolic diseases. The determination of a single business segment is consistent with the consolidated financial information regularly provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), who is the President and Chief Executive Officer. The CODM uses net loss to monitor budget versus actual results in assessing segment performance and the allocation of resources. The Company’s CODM also utilizes the Company’s long-range plan as a strategic tool to allocate resources according to the Company’s strategic objectives.
The Company sells its products to specialty pharmacies and through direct-to-patient distributors worldwide. Net product sales outside of the United States ("U.S.") were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Long-lived assets located outside the U.S. were $
4.5
 million as of December 31, 2024. The Company had 
no
 long-lived assets located outside the U.S. as of December 31, 2023. The measure of segment assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total assets. The accounting policies of the segment are the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
The following table presents reportable segment loss, including significant expenses regularly provided to the CODM, attributable to the Company’s reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 (
