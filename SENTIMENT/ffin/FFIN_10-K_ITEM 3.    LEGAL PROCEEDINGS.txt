MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to those listed in “Item 1A – Risk Factors” and in the “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” notice on page 1.

Introduction

As a financial holding company, we generate most of our revenue from interest on loans and investments, trust fees, gain on sale of mortgage loans and service charges and fees on deposit accounts. Our primary source of funding for our loans and investments are deposits held by our bank subsidiary, First Financial Bank. Our largest expenses are salaries and related employee benefits. We measure our performance by calculating our return on average assets, return on average equity, regulatory capital ratios, net interest margin and efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and noninterest income.

The following discussion and analysis of the major elements of our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and consolidated statements of earnings for the years 2022 through 2024 should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes, and selected financial data presented elsewhere in this Form 10-K.

Critical Accounting Policies

We prepare consolidated financial statements based on generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and customary practices in the banking industry. These policies, in certain areas, require us to make significant estimates and assumptions.

We deem a policy critical if (1) the accounting estimate required us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time we make the accounting estimate; and (2) different estimates that reasonably could have been used in the current period, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, would have a material impact on the financial statements.

We deem our most critical accounting policies to be (1) our allowance for credit losses and our provision for credit losses and (2) our valuation of financial instruments. We have other significant accounting policies and continue to evaluate the materiality of their impact on our consolidated financial statements, but we believe these other policies either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are difficult or subjective, or it is less likely they would have a material impact on our reported results for a given period. A discussion of (1) our allowance for credit losses and our provision for credit losses and (2) our valuation of financial instruments is included in Notes 1 and 10, respectively, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Stock Repurchase

On July 23, 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors extended the authorization to repurchase up to 5,000,000 common shares through July 31, 2025. The prior authorization had been in place since July 27, 2021. The stock repurchase plan authorizes management to repurchase and retire the stock at such time as repurchases and retirements are considered beneficial to the Company and stockholders. Any repurchase of stock will be made through the open market, block trades, or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Under the repurchase plan, there is no minimum number of shares that the Company is required to repurchase. Under the previous authorization effective through July 31, 2024, 244,559 shares were repurchased and retired (during the months of June and July 2022) at an average price of $38.61 per share. Additionally, 101,337 shares (all during September 2023) were repurchased and retired at an average price of $26.99 per share.

Other Recently Issued and Effective Authoritative Accounting Guidance

ASU 2022-06, "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848."
 ASU 2022-06 extends the period of time preparers can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance provided by ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01, which are discussed above. ASU 2022-06, which was effective upon issuance, defers the sunset date of this prior guidance from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief guidance in Topic 848. The adoption of ASU 2022-06 did not have a significant impact on our financial statements.

ASU 2023-02, "Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method."
 ASU 2023-02 is intended to improve the accounting and disclosures for investments in tax credit structures. ASU 2023-02 allows entities to elect to account for qualifying tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method, regardless of the program giving rise to the related income tax credits. Previously, this method was only available for qualifying tax equity

Table of Contents

investments in low-income housing tax credit structures. The adoption of ASU 2023-02 is not expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements and was not early adopted.

ASU 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures."
 ASU 2023-07 expands segment disclosure requirements for public entities to require disclosure of significant expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. ASU 2023-07 became effective for our annual financial statements in 2024 and will be effective for interim periods within fiscal years in 2025. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 did not have a significant impact on our financial statements.

ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.”
 ASU 2023-09 requires entities to disclose more detailed information in their reconciliation of their statutory tax rate to their effective tax rate. Public business entities (PBEs) are required to provide this incremental detail in a numerical, tabular format. The ASU also requires entities to disclose more detailed information about income taxes paid, including by jurisdiction; pretax income (or loss) from continuing operations; and income tax expense (or benefit). PBEs will be required to adopt the new requirements in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2025. The adoption of ASU 2023-09 is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements.

Results of Operations

Performance Summary
. Net earnings for 2024 were $223.51 million compared to net earnings of $198.98 million for 2023, reflecting an increase of $24.53 million, or 12.33%. The increase in earnings for 2024 over 2023 was primarily attributable to the overall growth in net interest income from the growth in earning assets. Additionally, trust fee income increased $6.99 million when compared to 2023 and there were no losses on sales of AFS securities in 2024 when compared to $7.12 million losses in 2023. The proceeds from sales of securities during 2023 were used to fund higher-yielding organic loan growth during 2024.

Net earnings for 2023 were $198.98 million compared to $234.48 million for 2022. Included in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, were (i) a decrease of $17.61 million in net interest income, (ii) a decrease in debit card revenues of $8.56 million, (iii) a decrease in mortgage revenues of $7.15 million, (iv) a $9.26 million decline in gains on sales of securities, and (v) an increase of $4.04 million in FDIC insurance premiums, which includes a $1.75 million special assessment. Offsetting these reductions to earnings were (i) a decline of $6.80 million in the provision for credit losses and (ii) a decline of $5.30 million in incentive and profit sharing expenses.

On a diluted net earnings per share basis, net earnings were $1.56 for 2024, as compared to $1.39 for 2023 and $1.64 for 2022. The return on average assets was 1.68% for 2024, as compared to 1.55% for 2023 and 1.76% for 2022. The return on average equity was 14.51% for 2024, as compared to 14.99% for 2023 and to 16.72% for 2022.

Net Interest Income
. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on liabilities incurred to fund those assets. Our earning assets consist primarily of loans and investment securities. Our liabilities to fund those assets consist primarily of noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits.

Tax-equivalent net interest income was $437.19 million in 2024, as compared to $395.36 million in 2023, and  $416.84 million in 2022. Average earning assets were $12.48 billion in 2024, as compared to $12.00 billion in 2023 and $12.46 billion in 2022. The increase in tax-equivalent net interest income in 2024 compared to 2023 was largely attributable to the change in the mix of interest earning assets primarily derived from an increase in average loans offset by a decrease in taxable and tax-exempt securities. Additionally, the rates received on loans continued to increase along with the rates paid on deposits. The increase of $483.34 million in average earning assets in 2024 when compared to 2023 was primarily a result of an increase in loans of $732.00 million, offset by a decrease in taxable securities of $211.16 million, and a decrease in tax-exempt securities of $176.36 million. The decrease in tax-equivalent net interest income in 2023 compared to 2022 was largely attributable to the increases in the rates paid on deposits and borrowings and a change in the mix of interest earning assets. The decrease of $461.72 million in average earning assets in 2023 when compared to 2022 was primarily a result of a decrease in taxable securities of $531.39 million and tax-exempt securities of $689.37 million offset by an increase in loans of $860.76 million when compared to 2022. Average interest-bearing liabilities were $8.39 billion in 2024, as compared to $7.84 billion in 2023 and $7.76 billion in 2022. The yield on earning assets increased 62 basis points in 2024 when compared to 2023 while the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 57 basis points. The yield on earning assets increased 90 basis points in 2023 when compared to 2022 while the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 143 basis points.

The table below allocates the change in tax-equivalent net interest income between the amount of change attributable to volume and to rate.

Table of Contents

The net interest margin for 2024 was 3.50% which was a increase of 21 basis points from 2023. The net interest margin in 2023 was 3.29%, a decrease of five basis points from 2022. The net interest margin has expanded during the past year primarily due to (i) a shift in asset mix from investment securities to higher yielding loans, and (ii) increased loan yields due to new and renewing loans and variable rate loans repricing higher. The Federal Reserve began aggressively increasing interest rates in March 2022 and continuing into 2023 with increases of 25 basis points in February, March, May, and July 2023. Most recently, the Federal Reserve decreased interest rates 50 basis points in September 2024, and 25 basis points in November and December 2024, respectively, resulting in a target range of 4.25% to 4.50% at December 31, 2024.

There are $1.09 billion of municipal and related deposits which are indexed to short-term treasury rates which have continued to increase with the changes in the applicable rate index. Average municipal and related deposits totaled $1.46 billion for both years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with an average rate paid of 3.94% and 3.13%, for the respective years then ended.

est income for 2024 was $123.99 million compared to $108.00 million in 2023. Changes in certain categories of noninterest income included (i) no losses on sales of AFS securities in 2024 when compared to $7.12 million losses in 2023, (ii) an increase in Trust fee income of $6.99 million and (iii) an increase in gain on sale and fees of mortgage loans of $1.29 million when compared to 2023. AFS securities totaling $411.13 million were sold during 2023 resulting in a loss on sales of securities of $7.12 million. There were no securities sales in 2024. Trust revenue has increased primarily due to growth in assets under management to $10.83 billion at December 31, 2024 compared to $9.78 billion at December 31, 2023, as well as increases in oil and gas related fees. Mortgage income increased to $13.18 million in 2024 compared to $11.89 million in 2023 due to increased loan volume.

Noninterest income for 2023 was $108.00 million compared to $131.67 million in 2022. Changes in certain categories of noninterest income included (i) a decline in gains on sales of AFS securities of $9.26 million, (ii) a decrease in debit card fees of $8.56 million, and (iii) a decrease in gain on sale and fees of mortgage loans of $7.15 million when compared to 2022. AFS securities totaling $411.13 million with an average book yield of 2.91% were sold during 2023. The proceeds from the sales of these securities are being used to fund organic loan growth that has been yielding approximately 8%. The decrease in debit card fees was due to the impact of becoming subject to regulations imposed by the Federal Reserve Board that limits debit card interchange revenue which became effective for the Company July 1, 2022, and is consistent with our previously disclosed expectations. Mortgage income declined due to lower overall origination volumes and declining margins on loan sales as a result of the increases in mortgage interest rates during 2023.

Noninterest Expense
. Total noninterest expense for 2024 amounted to $265.06 million, an increase of $27.18 million, or 11.43%, as compared to 2023. Total noninterest expense for 2023 was $237.88 million, an increase of $3.10 million, or 1.32%, as compared to 2022. An important measure in determining whether a financial institution effectively manages noninterest expenses is the efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis and noninterest income. Lower ratios indicate better efficiency since more income is generated with a lower noninterest expense total. Our efficiency ratio for 2024 was 47.23%, as compared to 47.26% for 2023 and 42.80% for 2022.

Salaries and employee benefits for 2024 totaled $153.30 million, an increase of $21.38 million, or 16.21%, as compared to 2023. The net increase reflected an increase of $12.90 million in profit sharing and officer bonus and incentive accruals related to growth in earnings over the prior year. Additionally, officer and employee salaries increased for additions to the middle market lending team and the audit and risk departments due to growth, as well as merit-based pay increases since the prior year.

All other categories of noninterest expense for 2024 totaled $111.77 million, an increase of $5.80 million, or 5.47%, as compared to 2023. Included in noninterest expense during 2024, excluding salary and employee benefit related costs, were increases in software amortization and expense, occupancy expense, and legal and professional fees offset by a decrease in FDIC insurance premiums of $1.25 million due to the special assessment in the prior year.

Salaries and employee benefits for 2023 totaled $131.92 million, a decrease of $2.22 million, or 1.65%, as compared to 2022. The net decrease reflected a decrease of $2.86 million in profit sharing expenses and lower mortgage compensation expenses of $2.40 million offset by annual merit-based and other market-based pay increases that were effective March 1, 2023.

All other categories of noninterest expense for 2023 totaled $105.97 million, an increase of $5.32 million, or 5.29%, as compared to 2022. Included in noninterest expense during 2023, excluding salary and employee benefit related costs, were increases in FDIC insurance premiums of $4.04 million primarily due to the recognition of $1.75 million related to the special assessment in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Income Taxes
. Income tax expense was $48.34 million for 2024, as compared to $44.32 million for 2023 and $46.40 million for 2022. Our effective tax rates on pretax income were 17.78%, 18.22% and 16.52%, respectively, for the years 2024, 2023 and 2022. The effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal tax rate of 21.0% largely due to tax exempt interest income earned on certain investment securities and loans, the deductibility of dividends paid to our employee stock ownership plan, excess tax benefits for distribution under our deferred compensation plan and vesting of equity awards, and New Market Tax Credit ("NMTC") benefits.

Balance Sheet Review

Loans
. Our portfolio is comprised of loans made to businesses, professionals, individuals, and farm and ranch operations located in the primary trade areas served by our subsidiary bank. As of December 31, 2024, total loans HFI were $7.91 billion, an increase of $764.31 million as compared to December 31, 2023.

As compared to year-end 2023 balances, total commercial loans increased $166.58 million, agricultural loans increased $10.65 million, total real estate loans increased $471.75 million, and total consumer loans increased $115.33 million. Loans averaged $7.52 billion during 2024, an increase of $732.00 million over 2023 average balances.

In conjunction with the adoption of ASC 326, the Company expanded its four loan portfolio segments used under the legacy disclosure requirements into the following ten portfolio segments. For modeling purposes, our loan portfolio segments include Commercial and Industrial (“C&I”), Municipal, Agricultural, Construction and Development, Farm, Non-Owner Occupied and Owner Occupied Commercial Real Estate

Loans HFS, consisting of secondary market mortgage loans, totaled $8.24 million and $14.25 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, $442 thousand and $3.18 million are valued at the lower of cost or fair value, and the remaining amount is valued under the fair value option.

The Company has certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan growth with an acceptable level of risk. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on an annual basis and makes changes as appropriate with input from our Board of Directors. Management receives and reviews monthly reports related to loan originations, quality, concentrations, delinquencies, nonperforming and potential problem loans. Diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions, both by type of loan and geographic location.

Commercial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower’s ability to operate profitably and effectively. Underwriting standards are designed to determine whether the borrower possesses sound business ethics and practices and to evaluate current and projected cash flows to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed. Commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and, secondarily, on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most commercial loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets, such as accounts receivable or inventory, and include personal guarantees.

Agricultural loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial loans. These agricultural loans are based primarily on the identified cash flows of the borrower and, secondarily, on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most agricultural loans are secured by the agriculture related assets being financed, such as farm land, cattle or equipment, and include personal guarantees.

Real estate loans are also subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and agricultural loans. These loans are underwritten primarily based on projected cash flows and, secondarily, as loans secured by real estate. The repayment of real estate loans is generally largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loans or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing the Company’s real estate portfolio are generally diverse in terms of type and geographic location within Texas. This diversity helps reduce the exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry.

Consumer loan underwriting utilizes methodical credit standards and analysis to supplement the Company’s underwriting policies and procedures. The Company’s loan policy addresses types of consumer loans that may be originated and the collateral, if secured, which must be

perfected. The relatively smaller individual dollar amounts of consumer loans that are spread over numerous individual borrowers also minimize the Company’s risk.

Commercial real estate loans (owner and non-owner occupied CRE) represent 23.87% of the Company's total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2024. Non-owner occupied CRE represents $805.57 million, or 10.18%, of the Company's total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2024. The properties securing this portfolio are diverse as to geographic location in Texas as well as industry type. Collateral for CRE loans is located throughout the Company's markets in central west Texas, the Dallas-Forth Worth metroplex and southeast Texas with less than 1% of properties located outside of the state. The largest concentrations in the CRE portfolio as to type are industrial/warehouse at approximately 13.91% and multifamily at approximately 7.64% as of December 31, 2024. All additional property type categories are 7% or less of the CRE portfolio. Credit underwriting standards are periodically reviewed and adjusted based upon observations from our ongoing monitoring of economic conditions in our lending areas. In response to the current interest rate environment and increases in benchmark rates, the Company has enhanced stress testing and loan review activities to mitigate interest rate reset risk with a specific emphasis on borrowers' abilities to absorb the impact of higher interest rates on loans.

Of the $4.67 billion of the variable interest rate loans shown above, loans totaling $2.07 billion mature or reprice over the next twelve months. Of this amount, approximately $1.90 billion will reprice immediately upon changes in the underlying index rate (primarily U.S. prime rate) with the remaining $173.43 million being subject to floors above or ceilings below the current index.

Asset Quality
. Our loan portfolio is subject to periodic reviews by our centralized independent loan review group as well as periodic examinations by bank regulatory agencies. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in the judgment of management, the collectability of principal or interest under the original terms becomes doubtful. Nonaccrual, past due 90 days or more and still accruing, and restructured loans plus foreclosed assets were $63.10 million at December 31, 2024, as compared to $35.10 million at December 31, 2023 and $24.33 million at December 31, 2022. As a percent of loans HFI and foreclosed assets, these assets were 0.80% at December 31, 2024, as compared to 0.49% at December 31, 2023 and 0.38% at December 31, 2022. As a percent of total assets, these assets were 0.45% at December 31, 2024, as compared to 0.27% at December 31, 2023 and 0.19% at December 31, 2022. We believe the level of these assets to be manageable and are not aware of any material classified credits not properly disclosed as nonperforming at December 31, 2024.

(1) With the adoption of ASU 2022-02, effective January 1, 2023, TDR accounting has been eliminated.

We record interest payments received on nonaccrual loans as reductions of principal. Prior to the loans being placed on nonaccrual, we recognized interest income on these loans as of December 31, 2024 of approximately $1.11 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. If interest on these loans had been recognized on a full accrual basis during the year ended December 31, 2024, such income would have approximated $5.35 million.

Included in our loan portfolio are certain other loans not included in the table above that are deemed to be potential problem loans. Potential problem loans are those loans that are currently performing, but for which known information about trends, uncertainties or possible credit problems of the borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with present repayment terms, possibly resulting in the transfer of such loans to nonperforming status. These potential problem loans totaled $11.25 million as of December 31, 2024.

See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on these assets.

Allowance for Credit Losses
. The allowance for credit losses is the amount we determine as of a specific date to be appropriate to absorb current expected credit losses on existing loans. For a discussion of our methodology, see our accounting policies in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The provision for credit losses was $13.82 million in 2024, $10.63 million in 2023, and $17.43 million in 2022. The Company's provision for credit losses during 2024 was driven by strong organic loan growth and an increase in classified loans. The increase in the Company's provision for credit losses during 2023 was driven by strong organic loan growth offset by a decrease in construction and development unfunded commitments.

As a percent of average loans, net loan charge-offs were 0.05% during 2024 and 0.03% during 2023, and net loan recoveries of 0.01% during 2022. The allowance for credit losses as a percent of loans HFI was 1.24% as of December 31, 2024, as compared to 1.24% as of December 31, 2023, and 1.18% as of December 31, 2022. Included in the following tables are further analysis of our allowance for credit losses.

Although we believe we use the best information available to make credit loss allowance determinations, future adjustments could be necessary if circumstances or economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making our initial determinations. A downturn in the economy or lower employment could result in increased levels of nonaccrual, past due 90 days or more and still accruing, foreclosed assets, charge-offs, increased provision for credit losses and reductions in income. Additionally, as an integral part of their examination process, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses. The banking agencies could require additions to our allowance for credit losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations of our bank subsidiary.

All yields are computed on a tax-equivalent basis assuming a marginal tax rate of 21%. Yields on AFS securities are based on amortized cost. Maturities of mortgage-backed securities are based on contractual maturities and could differ due to prepayments of underlying mortgages. Maturities of other securities are reported at the earlier of maturity date or call date.

Borrowings. 
Included in borrowings were federal funds purchased, advances from the FHLB and other borrowings of $135.60 million, $22.15 million and $23.68 million at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The average balance of federal funds purchased, advances from the FHLB and other borrowings were $54.94 million, $81.26 million and $127.87 million during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The average rates paid on these borrowings were 3.47%, 4.05% and 2.45% during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Repurchase Agreements.
 Securities sold under repurchase agreements are generally with significant customers of the Company that require short-term liquidity for their funds for which we pledge certain securities that have a fair value equal to at least the amount of the short-term borrowing. The average balances of securities sold under repurchase agreements were $173.07 million, $568.21 million and $674.23 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The average balances of securities sold under repurchase agreements has decreased from the prior year as customers have moved funds to IntraFi deposit accounts. The average rates paid on securities sold under repurchase agreements were 3.16%, 2.84% and 0.31% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and advances from the FHLB was 2.01%, 3.27% and 1.96% at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The highest amount of federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and advances from the FHLB at any month-end during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $563.28 million, $822.98 million and $1.04 billion, respectively.

Interest Rate Risk

Interest rate risk results when the maturity or repricing intervals of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are different. Our exposure to interest rate risk is managed primarily through our strategy of selecting the types and terms of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that generate favorable earnings while limiting the potential negative effects of changes in market interest rates. We use no off-balance-sheet financial instruments to manage interest rate risk.

Our subsidiary bank has an asset liability management committee that monitors interest rate risk and compliance with investment policies. The subsidiary bank utilizes an earnings simulation model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market rates. The model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income and net income over the next twelve months. The model measures the impact on net interest income relative to a base case scenario of hypothetical fluctuations in interest rates over the next twelve months. These simulations incorporate assumptions regarding balance sheet growth and mix, pricing and the re-pricing and maturity characteristics of the existing and projected balance sheet.

The following analysis depicts the estimated impact on net interest income of immediate changes in interest rates at the specified levels for the periods presented.

The results for the net interest income simulations as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 resulted in an asset sensitive position. These are good faith estimates and assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at each year-end will remain constant over the relevant twelve-month measurement period and that changes in market interest rates are instantaneous and sustained across the yield curve regardless of duration of pricing characteristics on specific assets or liabilities. Also, this analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates. We believe these estimates are not necessarily indicative of what actually could occur in the event of immediate interest rate increases or decreases of this magnitude. As interest-bearing assets and liabilities reprice in different time frames and proportions to market interest rate movements, various assumptions must be made based on historical relationships of these variables in reaching any conclusion. Since these correlations are based on competitive and market conditions, we anticipate that our future results will likely be different from the foregoing estimates, and such differences could be material.

Should we be unable to maintain a reasonable balance of maturities and repricing of our interest-earning assets and our interest-bearing liabilities, we could be required to dispose of our assets in an unfavorable manner or pay a higher than market rate to fund our activities. Our asset liability committee oversees and monitors this risk.

The fair value of our investment securities classified as available-for-sale totaled $4.62 billion at December 31, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the corresponding unrealized loss before taxes on the portfolio of $510.92 million at December 31, 2023, changed to an unrealized loss before taxes of $537.55 million at December 31, 2024, which is recorded net of taxes in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) in shareholders' equity. The unrealized gains or losses, net of taxes, on the portfolio are excluded from the calculation of all regulatory capital ratios. The changes in the fair value were driven by changes in interest rates based on expected actions by the Federal Reserve Board and other market conditions. The overall valuation of the portfolio is most correlated to the 5-year U.S. Treasury rates based on the composition and duration of the portfolio. At December 31, 2024, the 5-year U.S. Treasury rate was 4.39% compared to 3.84% at December 31, 2023, representing a 55 basis point increase during the year. As of December 31, 2024, an increase of 100 basis points in the 5-year U.S. Treasury rate would result in an increase to unrealized losses by approximately $231.38 million before taxes, while a 100 basis point decrease in the same rate would result in a decrease to unrealized losses by approximately $193.96 million before taxes. We believe that we have the ability to hold these securities based on our overall liquidity and intent to hold the portfolio.

Capital and Liquidity

Capital.
 We evaluate capital resources by our ability to maintain adequate regulatory capital ratios to do business in the banking industry. Issues related to capital resources arise primarily when we are growing at an accelerated rate but not retaining a significant amount of our profits or when we experience significant asset quality deterioration.

Total shareholders’ equity was $1.61 billion, or 11.49% of total assets at December 31, 2024, as compared to $1.50 billion, or 11.44% of total assets at December 31, 2023. Included in shareholders’ equity were $424.29 million and $403.30 million  at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in unrealized losses on investment securities AFS, net of related income taxes. Unrealized gains and losses on investment securities AFS are excluded from and do not impact regulatory capital. During 2024, total shareholders’ equity averaged $1.54 billion, or 11.56% of average assets, as compared to $1.33 billion, or 10.32% of average assets during 2023.

Banking regulators measure capital adequacy by means of the risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio under the Basel III Rules and prompt corrective action regulations. The risk-based capital rules provide for the weighting of assets and off-balance-sheet commitments and contingencies according to prescribed risk categories. Regulatory capital is then divided by risk-weighted assets to determine the risk-adjusted capital ratios. The leverage ratio is computed by dividing shareholders’ equity less intangible assets by quarter-to-date average assets less intangible assets.

Beginning in January 2015, under the Basel III Rules, the implementation of the capital conservation buffer was effective for the Company starting at the 0.625% level and increasing 0.625% each year thereafter, until it reached 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and requires increased capital levels for the purpose of capital distributions and other payments. Failure to meet the amount of the buffer will result in restrictions on the Company’s ability to make capital distributions, including divided payments and stock repurchases, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had a total risk-based capital ratio of 20.00% and 19.62%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 18.83% and 18.50%, a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted ratio of 18.83% and 18.50% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.49% and 12.06%, respectively. The regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were calculated under Basel III Rules.

Our subsidiary bank made the election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from capital in connection with its March 31, 2015 quarterly financial filing and, in effect, to retain the accumulated other comprehensive income treatment under the prior capital rules.

Liquidity.
 Liquidity is our ability to meet cash demands as they arise. Such needs can develop from loan demand, deposit withdrawals or acquisition opportunities. Potential obligations resulting from the issuance of standby letters of credit and commitments to fund future borrowings to our loan customers are other factors affecting our liquidity needs. Many of these obligations and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon; therefore the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements affecting our liquidity position. The potential need for liquidity arising from these types of financial instruments is represented by the contractual notional amount of the instrument. Asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable or which will mature in the near future. Liquid assets include cash, federal funds sold, and short-term investments in time deposits in banks. Liquidity is also provided by access to funding sources, which include core depositors and correspondent banks that maintain accounts with and sell federal funds to our subsidiary bank. Other sources of funds include our ability to borrow from short-term sources, such as purchasing federal funds from correspondent banks, sales of securities under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings, which amounted to $197.02 at December 31, 2024, and an unfunded $25.00 million revolving line of credit established with Frost Bank, a nonaffiliated bank, which matures on June 30, 2025 (see next paragraph). Our subsidiary bank also has federal funds purchased lines of credit with two non-affiliated banks totaling $130.00 million. At December 31, 2024, there were no amounts drawn on these lines of credit. Our subsidiary bank also has (i) an available line of credit with the FHLB totaling $1.86 billion at December 31, 2024, secured by portions of our loan portfolio and certain investment securities; and (ii) access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas lending program, including the Bank Term Funding Program, secured by portions of certain investment securities. At December 31, 2024, there was $1.05 billion used on the FHLB line advance for undisbursed commitments (letters of credit) used to secure public funds.

The Company renewed its loan agreement, effective June 30, 2023, with Frost Bank. Under the loan agreement, as renewed and amended, we are permitted to draw up to $25.00 million on a revolving line of credit. See Note 8 - Line of Credit in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements regarding further information on this line of credit.

In addition, we anticipate that any future acquisition of financial institutions, expansion of branch locations or offering of new products could also place a demand on our cash resources. Available cash and cash equivalents at the Company, which totaled $94.59 million at December 31, 2024, investment securities which totaled $2.12 million at December 31, 2024 with maturities over 5 to 6 years, available dividends from our subsidiaries which totaled $428.66 million at December 31, 2024, utilization of available lines of credit, and future debt or equity offerings are expected to be the source of funding for these potential acquisitions or expansions.

The Company continuously monitors the Company's liquidity position to ensure that assets and liabilities are managed in a manner that will meet all of the Company's short-term and long-term cash requirements. The Company manages the Company's liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of customers, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of the Company's shareholders. The Company also monitors its liquidity requirements in light of interest rate trends, changes in the economy, and the scheduled maturity and interest rate sensitivity of the investment and loan portfolios and deposits.

In the ordinary course of business, we have entered into contractual obligations and have made other commitments to make future payments. Refer to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for the expected timing of such payments as of December 31, 2024. These payments related to time deposits with stated maturity dates (Note 7 - Deposits and Borrowings) and operating leases (Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies). In addition, we have construction contracts with remaining future minimum contractual obligations of approximately $358 thousand in 2025.

Off-Balance Sheet/Reserve for Unfunded Commitments. 
We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet (“OBS”) risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include unfunded lines of credit, commitments to extend credit and federal funds sold to correspondent banks and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2024, the Company’s reserve for unfunded commitments totaled $8.68 million which is recorded in other liabilities.

Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instrument for unfunded lines of credit, commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of these instruments. We generally use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments.

Unfunded lines of credit and commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, as we deem necessary upon extension of credit, is based on our credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant, and equipment and income-producing commercial properties.

52

Table of Contents

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issue to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The average collateral value held on letters of credit usually exceeds the contract amount.

See further disclosure of the unfunded lines of credit, unfunded commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit (Note 12 - Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk). Future notional amounts committed are $1.04 billion in less than one year, $601.28 million in more than one year but less than three years and $525.41 million thereafter.

We believe we have no other OBS arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated, special purpose entities that would expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of the financial statements.

Parent Company Funding
. Our ability to fund various operating expenses, dividends, and cash acquisitions is generally dependent on our own earnings (without giving effect to our subsidiaries), cash reserves and funds derived from our subsidiaries. These funds historically have been produced by intercompany dividends and management fees that are limited to reimbursement of actual expenses. We anticipate that our recurring cash sources will continue to include dividends and management fees from our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, $428.66 million was available for the payment of intercompany dividends by our subsidiaries without the prior approval of regulatory agencies. Our subsidiaries paid aggregate dividends to us of $55.50 million in 2024 and $133.50 million in 2023.

Dividends
. Our long-term dividend policy is to pay cash dividends to our shareholders of approximately 35% to 40% of annual net earnings while maintaining adequate capital to support growth. We are also restricted by a loan covenant within our line of credit agreement with Frost Bank to dividend no greater than 55% of net income, as defined in such loan agreement. The cash dividend payout ratios have amounted to 46.06%, 50.96% and 40.18% of net earnings, respectively, in 2024, 2023 and 2022. Given our current capital position, projected earnings and asset growth rates, we do not anticipate any significant change in our current dividend policy.

To pay dividends, we and our subsidiary bank must maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines and comply with the general requirements applicable to a Texas corporation. Generally, a Texas corporation may not pay a dividend to its shareholders if (i) after giving effect to the dividend, the corporation would be insolvent, or (ii) the amount of the dividend would exceed the surplus of the corporation. In addition, if the applicable regulatory authority believes that a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice (which, depending on the financial condition of the bank, could include the payment of dividends), the authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from the unsafe practice. As a member bank, First Financial Bank may not declare or pay a dividend if the total of all dividends declared during the calendar year, including the proposed dividend, exceeds the sum of the bank's net income (as reportable in its Reports of Condition and Income) during the current calendar year and the retained net income of the prior two calendar years, unless the dividend has been approved by the Federal Reserve Board.

The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the Texas Department of Banking, and the OCC have each indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. The Federal Reserve Board, the Texas Department of Banking, the OCC and the FDIC expect that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

As of December 31, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Our management, which includes our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud.

A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded, based on our evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024.

Subsequent to our evaluation, there were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting or other factors that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of First Financial Bankshares, Inc. and subsidiaries is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. First Financial Bankshares, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.

First Financial Bankshares, Inc. and subsidiaries’ management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, it used the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (COSO) in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework
. Based on our assessment we believe that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is effective based on those criteria.

Ernst & Young LLP, Fort Worth, Texas, (U.S. PCAOB Auditor Firm I.D.: 
42
), the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2024. The report, which expresses an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, is included below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of First Financial Bankshares, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited First Financial Bankshares, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, First Financial Bankshares, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings (loss), shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 and the related notes and our report dated February 20, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of First Financial Bankshares, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of First Financial Bankshares, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings (loss), shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Allowance for Credit Losses

Description of the Matter

As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s loan portfolio totaled $7.9 billion and the related allowance for credit losses (ACL) was $98.3 million. The Company calculates their allowance for credit losses in accordance with ASC 326, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses, utilizing a forward-looking expected loss model (the “Current Expected Credit Losses (CECL)” model) to estimate credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Company’s loan portfolio. As discussed in Notes 1 and 3 of the consolidated financial statements, the ACL is an amount which represents management’s best estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual life of the Company’s loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The ACL includes credit loss estimates for loans evaluated using common risk characteristics such as financial asset type, collateral type, and industry of the borrower. The Company uses a discounted cash flow method, incorporating historical losses that are correlated to economic variables that are determined to be the most relevant indicators of expected losses. Those economic variables are forecasted over the reasonable and supportable forecast period to determine the current expected credit losses. Qualitative adjustments are then made to account for factors that management does not believe are captured within the CECL quantitative models. Management applies judgment in estimating the ACL and, in particular, identifying and quantifying qualitative adjustments included within the ACL.

F-
1

Table of Contents

Auditing management’s estimate of the allowance for credit losses involved a high degree of subjectivity due to the complexity of the models and the qualitative adjustments included in the estimate. Management’s identification and measurement of the qualitative adjustments is highly judgmental and could have a significant impact on the allowance for credit losses.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding of the Company’s process for estimating the allowance for credit losses, including the models used and the qualitative adjustments made to establish the ACL. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the model methodology, including the qualitative adjustment methodology, the monitoring procedures performed over the models, the identification and the measurement of the qualitative adjustments, the reliability and accuracy of data used to estimate the qualitative adjustments, and management’s review and approval of the qualitative adjustments.
To test the models, with the support of specialists, we evaluated the model methodology and design. On a sample basis, we independently tested the key inputs used in the models by agreeing to internal and external sources. Additionally, on a sample basis, we performed an independent recalculation of the models’ output. To test the qualitative adjustments, we evaluated the identification and measurement of the adjustments, including the basis for concluding the adjustments were reasonable. We independently tested the completeness and accuracy of data used by the Company to estimate the qualitative adjustments by agreeing underlying data to relevant sources. On a sample basis, with the support of specialists, we recalculated the qualitative adjustments.

ARES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022

1. 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Nature of Operations

First Financial Bankshares, Inc. (a Texas corporation) (“Bankshares”, “Company”, “we” or “us”) is a financial holding company which owns all of the capital stock of one bank with 
79
 locations located in Texas as of 
December 31, 2024
. The Company’s subsidiary bank is First Financial Bank. The Company’s primary source of revenue is providing loans and banking services to consumers and commercial customers in the market area in which First Financial Bank. is located. In addition, the Company also owns First Financial Trust & Asset Management Company, First Financial Insurance Agency, Inc., First Technology Services, Inc., FFB Investment Paris Fund, LLC and FFB Portfolio Management, Inc.
Basis of Presentation

A summary of significant accounting policies of the Company and its subsidiaries applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements follows. The accounting principles followed by the Company and the methods of applying them are in conformity with both United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and prevailing practices of the banking industry.

The Company evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company’s significant estimates include its allowance for credit losses and its valuation of financial instruments.

Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bankshares and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Stock Repurchase

On July 23, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors extended the authorization to repurchase up to 
5,000,000
 common shares through July 31, 2025. The prior authorization had been in place since July 27, 2021. The stock repurchase plan authorizes management to repurchase and retire the stock at such time as repurchases and retirements are considered beneficial to the Company and its stockholders. Any repurchase of stock will be made through the open market, block trades, or in privately negotiated transactions in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Under the repurchase plan, there is 
no
 minimum number of shares that the Company is required to repurchase. Under the previous authorization effective through July 31, 2024, 
244,559
 shares were repurchased and retired (during the months of June and July 2022) at an average price of $
38.61
 per share. Additionally, 
101,337
 shares were repurchased and retired (all during September 2023) at an average price of $
26.99
 per share.

Investment Securities

Management classifies debt securities as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading based on its intent. Securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and recorded at amortized cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, which are recognized as adjustments to interest income using the interest method. Securities not classified as held-to-maturity or trading are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses (those for which no allowance for credit losses are recorded) reported as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax. Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase.

Interest income includes amortization of purchase premiums and discounts over the period to maturity using a level-yield method, except for premiums on callable securities, which are amortized to their earliest call date. Realized gains and losses are recorded on the sale of securities in noninterest income.

The Company has made a policy election to exclude accrued interest from the amortized cost basis of securities and report accrued interest separately in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. A security is placed on nonaccrual status at the time any principal or interest payments become more than 
90
 days delinquent or if full collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain. Accrued interest for a security placed on nonaccrual is reversed against interest income. There was no accrued interest related to securities reversed against interest income for the years ended 
December 31, 2024 or 2023.

The Company records its available-for-sale securities portfolio at fair value. Fair values of these securities are determined based on methodologies in accordance with current authoritative accounting guidance. Fair values are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors, including market interest rates, prepayment speeds, discount rates, credit ratings and yield curves. Fair values for securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments or an estimate of fair value by using a range of fair value estimates in the market place as a result of the illiquid market specific to the type of security.

The Company’s investment portfolio currently consists of obligations of state and political subdivisions, mortgage pass-through securities, corporate bonds and general obligation or revenue based municipal bonds. Pricing for such securities is generally readily available and transparent in the market. The Company utilizes independent third-party pricing services to value its investment securities, which the Company reviews as well as the underlying pricing methodologies for reasonableness and to ensure such prices are aligned with pricing matrices. The Company validates prices supplied by the independent pricing services by comparison to prices obtained from other third-party sources on a quarterly basis.

Allowance for Credit Losses – Available-for-Sale Securities

For available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position, we first assess whether we intend to sell, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, any previously recognized allowances are charged-off and the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income as a provision for credit losses. For available-for-sale securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis.

Management has made the accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale securities from the estimate of credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit losses. Available-for-sale securities are charged-off against the allowance or, in the absence of any allowance, written down through income when deemed uncollectible by management or when either of the aforementioned criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023
, 
no
 allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale securities was recorded.

Allowance for Credit Losses – Held-to-Maturity Securities

The allowance for credit losses on held-to-maturity securities is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of held-to-maturity securities to present management’s best estimate of the net amount expected to be collected. Held-to-maturity securities are charged-off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible by management. Adjustments to the allowance are reported in our income statement as a component of credit loss expense. Management measures expected credit losses on held-to-maturity securities on a collective basis by major security type with each type sharing similar risk characteristics and considers historical credit loss information that is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Management has made the accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on held-to-maturity securities from the estimate of credit losses.

At December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Company held 
no
 securities that were classified as held-to-maturity.
Loans Held-for-Investment
Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses. Amortized cost is the principal balance outstanding, net of purchase premiums and discounts, fair value hedge accounting adjustments, deferred loan fees and costs. The Company has made a policy election to exclude accrued interest from the amortized cost basis of loans and report accrued interest separately from the related loan balance in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Interest on loans is calculated by using the simple interest method on daily balances of the principal amounts outstanding. The Company defers and amortizes net loan origination fees and costs as an adjustment to yield.

Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when, in management’s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. In determining whether or not a borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations for each class of loans, we consider the borrower’s debt service capacity through the analysis of current financial information, if available, and/or current information with regards to our collateral position. Regulatory provisions would typically require the placement of a loan on nonaccrual status if principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection or full payment of principal and interest is not expected. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual status regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. When interest accrual is discontinued, all unpaid accrued interest is reversed. Interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received in excess of principal due. A loan may be returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured.

Further information regarding our accounting policies related to past due loans, nonaccrual loans and troubled-debt restructurings is presented in Note 3.

Acquired Loans

Loans acquired in connection with acquisitions are recorded at their acquisition-date fair value. The allowance for credit losses related to the acquired loan portfolio is not carried over. Acquired loans are classified into two categories based on the credit risk characteristics of the underlying borrowers as either purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans, or loans with no evidence of credit deterioration (“non-PCD”).
PCD loans are defined as a loan or pool of loans that have experienced more-than-insignificant credit deterioration since the origination date. The Company uses a combination of individual and pooled review approaches to determine if acquired loans are PCD. At acquisition, the Company considers a number of factors to determine if an acquired loan or pool of loans has experienced more-than-insignificant credit deterioration.

The initial allowance related to PCD loans that share similar risk characteristics is established using a pooled approach. The Company uses either a discounted cash flow or weighted average remaining life method to determine the required level of the allowance. PCD loans that were classified as nonaccrual as of the acquisition date and are collateral dependent are assessed for allowance on an individual

F-

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022

basis. For PCD loans, an initial allowance for credit losses is established on the acquisition date. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the initial allowance for credit losses on PCD loans will increase or decrease based on future evaluations, with changes recognized in the provision for credit losses.

Non-PCD loans are pooled into segments together with originated loans that share similar risk characteristics and have an allowance established on the acquisition date, which is recognized in the current period provision for credit losses as well as a fair value adjustment to the amortized cost of the loan and accreted into income over the life of the loan.

Determining the fair value of the acquired loans involves estimating the principal and interest payment cash flows expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at a market rate of interest. Management considers a number of factors in evaluating the acquisition-date fair value including the remaining life, interest rate profile, market interest rate environment, payment schedules, risk ratings, probability of default and loss given default, and estimated prepayment rates. For PCD loans, the non-credit discount or premium is allocated to individual loans as determined by the difference between the loan’s unpaid principal balance and amortized cost basis. For non-PCD loans, the fair value discount or premium is allocated to individual loans and recognized into interest income on a level yield basis over the remaining expected life of the loan.

Allowance for Credit Losses—Loans

The allowance for credit losses (“allowance” or “ACL”) is a contra-asset valuation account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans. The ACL represents an amount which, in management’s judgement, is adequate to absorb the lifetime expected credit losses that may be experienced on outstanding loans at the balance sheet date based on the evaluation of the size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, past events, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions and prepayment experience. The allowance for credit losses is measured and recorded upon the initial recognition of a financial asset. Determination of the adequacy of the allowance is inherently complex and requires the use of significant and highly subjective estimates. Loans are charged-off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible by management. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. Adjustments to the allowance are reported in our income statement as a component of the provision for credit losses. Management has made the accounting policy election to exclude accrued interest receivable on loans from the estimate of credit losses.

The Company’s methodology for estimating the allowance includes: (1) a collective quantified reserve that reflects the Company’s historical default and loss experience adjusted for expected economic conditions throughout a reasonable and supportable period and the Company’s prepayment and curtailment rates; (2) collective qualitative factors based on the risk perceived in concentrations of the loan portfolio, changes in economic conditions, early delinquencies, and factors related to credit administrations, including, among others, underwriting standards, loan-to-value ratios, and borrowers’ risk rating; and (3) individual allowances on loans where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty or when the Company determines that the foreclosure is probable.

In calculating the allowance for credit losses, most loans are segmented into pools based upon similar characteristics and risk profiles. Common characteristics and risk profiles include the type/purpose of loan, underlying collateral, geographical similarity and historical/expected credit loss patterns. In developing these loan pools for the purposes of modeling expected credit losses, we also analyzed the degree of correlation in how loans within each portfolio respond when subjected to varying economic conditions and scenarios as well as other portfolio stress factors. For modeling purposes, our loan portfolio segments include C&I, Municipal, Agricultural, Construction and Development, Farm, Non-Owner Occupied and Owner Occupied CRE, Residential, Consumer Auto and Consumer Non-Auto. We periodically reassess each pool to ensure the loans within the pool continue to share similar characteristics and risk profiles and to determine whether further segmentation is necessary. Refer to Note 3 for more details on the Company’s portfolio segments.
The Company applies two methodologies to estimate the allowance on its pooled portfolio segments; discounted cash flows method and weighted average remaining life method. Allowance estimates on the following portfolio segments are calculated using the discounted cash flows method: C&I, Municipal, Construction and Development, Farm, Non-Owner Occupied and Owner Occupied CRE and Residential. Allowance estimates on the following portfolio segments are calculated using the remaining life method: Agriculture, Consumer Auto and Consumer Non-Auto. The models related to these methodologies utilize the Company’s historical default and loss experience adjusted for future economic forecasts. The reasonable and supportable forecast period represents a one-year economic outlook for the applicable economic variables. Following the end of the reasonable and supportable forecast period expected losses

revert back to the historical mean over the next two years on a straight-line basis. Economic variables that have the most significant impact on the allowance include; Texas unemployment rate, Texas house price index and Texas retail sales index. Contractual loan level cash flows within the discounted cash flows methodology are adjusted for the Company’s historical prepayment and curtailment rate experience.

In some cases, management may determine that an individual loan exhibits unique risk characteristics which differentiate the loan from other loans within our loan pools. In such cases, the loans are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis and excluded from the collective evaluation. Specific allocations of the allowance for credit losses are determined by analyzing the borrower’s ability to repay amounts owed, collateral deficiencies, the relative risk rating of the loan and economic conditions affecting the borrower’s industry, among other things. A loan is considered to be collateral dependent when, based upon management’s assessment, the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the sale of the collateral. In such cases, expected credit losses are based on the fair value of the collateral at the measurement date, adjusted for estimated selling costs if satisfaction of the loan depends on the sale of the collateral. We reevaluate the fair value of collateral supporting collateral dependent loans on an ongoing basis.

Management qualitatively adjusts model results for risk factors that are not considered within our modeling processes but are nonetheless relevant in assessing the expected credit losses within our loan pools. These qualitative factor (“Q-Factor”) adjustments may increase or decrease management’s estimate of expected credit losses based upon the estimated level of risk within the risk factor. The various risk factors that may be considered in making Q-Factor adjustments include, among other things, the impact of (i) changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and practices for collections, write-offs, and recoveries, (ii) actual and expected changes in national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the loan pools, (iii) changes in the nature, volume and size of a loan or the loan pools and in the terms of the underlying loans, (iv) changes in the experience, ability, and depth of our lending management and staff, (v) changes in volume and severity of past due financial assets, the volume of nonaccrual assets, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded assets, (vi) changes in the quality of our credit review function, (vii) changes in the value of the underlying collateral for loans that are non-collateral dependent, (viii) the existence, growth, and effect of any concentrations of credit, and (ix) other factors such as the regulatory, legal and technological environments; competition; and events such as natural disasters or health pandemics.

Management believes it uses relevant information available to make determinations about the allowance and that it has established the existing allowance in accordance with GAAP. However, the determination of the allowance requires significant judgment, and estimates of expected lifetime losses in the loan portfolio can vary significantly from the amounts actually observed. While management uses available information to recognize expected losses, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in the loans comprising the portfolio, changes in the current and forecasted economic conditions, changes to the interest rate environment which may directly impact prepayment and curtailment rate assumptions, and changes in the financial condition of borrowers.

Allowance for Credit Losses—Off-Balance-Sheet/Reserve for Unfunded Commitments
The allowance for credit losses on off-balance-sheet credit exposures is a liability account, calculated in accordance with ASC 326, representing expected credit losses over the contractual period for which we are exposed to credit risk resulting from a contractual obligation to extend credit. These obligations include unfunded lines of credit, commitments to extend credit and federal funds sold to correspondent banks and standby letters of credit. No allowance is recognized if we have the unconditional right to cancel the obligation. The allowance is reported as a component of accrued interest payable and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Adjustments to the allowance are reported in our income statement as a component of the provision for credit losses. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s reserve for unfunded commitments totaled 
$
8,677,000
 and 
$
7,903,000
, respectively, which is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.

Other Real Estate

Other real estate owned is foreclosed property held pending disposition and is initially recorded at fair value, less estimated costs to sell. At foreclosure, if the fair value of the real estate, less estimated costs to sell, is less than the Company’s recorded investment in the related loan, a write-down is recognized through a charge to the ACL. Any subsequent reduction in value is recognized by a charge to income. Operating and holding expenses of such properties, net of related income, and gains and losses on their disposition are included in net gain (loss) on sale of foreclosed assets as incurred.

Bank Premises and Equipment

Bank premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the respective lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter.
Business Combinations, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The Company accounts for all business combinations under the purchase method of accounting. Tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity are recorded at fair value. Intangible assets with finite useful lives represent the future benefit associated with the acquisition of the core deposits and are amortized over 
seven years
, utilizing a method that approximates the expected attrition of the deposits. Goodwill with an indefinite life is not amortized, but rather tested annually for impairment as of June 30 each year and totaled 
$
313,481,000
 at both December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively. There was 
no
 impairment recorded for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
The carrying amount of goodwill arising from acquisitions that qualify as an asset purchase for federal income tax purposes was 
$
6,418,000
 a
nd 
$
8,826,000
 at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively, and is deductible for federal income tax purposes.

Securities Sold Under Agreements To Repurchase

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which are classified as borrowings, generally mature within 
one to four days
 from the transaction date. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are reflected at the amount of the cash received in connection with the transaction. The Company may be required to provide additional collateral based on the estimated fair value of the underlying securities.

Segment Reporting

The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2023-07 "Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvement to Reportable Segment Disclosures" on January 1, 2024. The Company has determined that its banking regions meet the aggregation criteria of ASC 280, Segment Reporting, since each of its banking regions and subsidiaries offer similar products and services, operate in a similar manner, have similar customers and report to the same regulatory authority, and therefore operate one line of business (community banking) located in a single geographic area (Texas). The Company's Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”).
The CODM regularly assesses performance of the aggregated single operating and reporting segment and decides how to allocate resources based on the net income calculated on the same basis as the net income reported in the Company's consolidated statements of earnings and other comprehensive earnings. The CODM is also regularly provided with expense information at a level that is consistent with that disclosed in the Company's consolidated statements of earnings and other comprehensive earnings.

Statements of Cash Flows

For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, amounts due from banks, including interest-bearing deposits in banks with original maturity of 
90 days or less
, and federal funds sold.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Unrealized net losses on the Company’s available-for-sale securities, net of applicable income taxes, totaled 
$
424,289,000
 and 
$
403,298,000
 at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023
, respectively, are included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings (loss) as a separate component of shareholders' equity.

Income Taxes

The Company’s provision for income taxes is based on income before income taxes adjusted for permanent differences between financial reporting and taxable income. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of the various balance sheet assets and liabilities and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws. See note 9 for more information on deferred income taxes.

Stock Based Compensation

The Company grants stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair value using the Black-Scholes model of the shares at the grant date. The grant date fair value is amortized over the vesting period which generally is three, five or six years. The Company also grants restricted stock and/or units for a fixed number of shares which generally vests over periods of one to three years and performance stock units which vest over a three-year period based on Company performance metrics relative to a defined peer group. For stock option grants, the exercise price is established based on the closing trading price of the Company's common stock and for restricted grants, the fair value of the grant is also measured based on the closing trading price. No adjustments have been necessary to properly value the grant based on the terms or other conditions of the grants. Expense is recognized based on the  fair value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest, reduced for forfeitures based on grant-date fair value. See Note 17 for further information.

Per Share Data

Net earnings per share (“EPS”) are computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding during the period. The Company calculates diluted EPS assuming all outstanding stock options to purchase common shares and unvested restricted stock shares have been exercised and/or vested at the beginning of the year (or the time of issuance, if later.) The dilutive effect of the outstanding options and restricted stock is determined by application of the treasury stock method, whereby the proceeds from the exercised options and unearned compensation for restricted stock are assumed to be used to purchase common shares at the average market price during the respective year. Anti-dilutive shares for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
 were 
503,000,

473,000
 and 
1,261,000
, respectively, and were excluded from the computation of EPS.

Other Recently Issued and Effective Authoritative Accounting Guidance

ASU 2023-02, "Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method."
 ASU 2023-02 is intended to improve the accounting and disclosures for investments in tax credit structures. ASU 2023-02 allows entities to elect to account for qualifying tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method, regardless of the program giving rise to the related income tax credits. Previously, this method was only available for qualifying tax equity investments in low-income housing tax credit structures. The adoption of ASU 2023-02 is not expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements and was not early adopted.
ASU 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures."
 ASU 2023-07 expands segment disclosure requirements for public entities to require disclosure of significant expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. ASU 2023-07 became effective for our annual financial statements in 2024 and will be effective for interim periods within fiscal years in 2025. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 did not have a significant impact on our financial statements.
ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.”
 ASU 2023-09 requires entities to disclose more detailed information in their reconciliation of their statutory tax rate to their effective tax rate. Public business entities (PBEs) are required to provide this incremental detail in a numerical, tabular format. The ASU also requires entities to disclose more detailed information about income taxes paid, including by jurisdiction; pretax income (or loss) from continuing operations; and income tax expense (or benefit). PBEs will be required to adopt the new requirements in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2025. The adoption of ASU 2023-09 is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements.

t hold any securities classified as held-to-maturity for the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Company invests in mortgage-backed securities that have expected maturities that differ from their contractual maturities. These differences arise because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without a prepayment penalty. These securities include collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and other asset backed securities. The expected maturities of these securities at December 31, 2024, were computed by using scheduled amortization of balances and historical prepayment rates.

The number of investments in an unrealized loss position totaled 
816
 at December 31, 2024. Any unrealized losses in the U.S. treasuries and government agencies, state and municipal, mortgage-backed and asset-backed investment securities at December 31, 2024 are due to changes in interest rates and not credit-related events. As such, no allowance for credit losses is required at December 31, 2024. Unrealized losses on investment securities are expected to recover over time as these securities approach maturity. Based on evaluations of impaired securities as of December 31, 2024, the Company does not intend to sell any impaired available for sale securities before fair value recovers to the current amortized cost, and it is more-likely-than-not that the Company will not be required to sell impaired securities before fair value recovers, which may be maturity. Our mortgage related securities are backed by GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC or are collateralized by securities backed by these agencies. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
67.17
%
 and 
66.15
%
, respectively, of our available-for-sale securities that are obligations of states and political subdivisions were issued within the State of Texas, of which 
55.77
%
 and 
56.16
%
, respectively, were guaranteed by the Texas Permanent School Fund.

Securities, carried at approximately 
$
2,545,822,000
 and 
$
2,964,467,000
 on December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were pledged as collateral for public or trust fund deposits, repurchase agreements, borrowings and for other purposes required or permitted by law.
During 2024
, there were 
no
 sales of investment securities that were classified as available-for-sale. During 
2023 and 2022, sales of investment securities that were classified as available-for-sale totaled 
$
411,134,000
 and 
$
479,273,000
, respectively. There were 
no
 gross realized securities gains or losses from sales and calls during 
2024. Gross realized gains from 2023 and 2022 securities sales and calls were 
$
1,699,000
 and

6,618,000
, respectively. Gross realized losses from securities sales and calls during 2023 and 2022 were

, respectively.

The specific identification method was used to determine cost in order to compute the realized gains and losses

From a credit risk standpoint, the Company rates its loans in one of five categories: (i) pass, (ii) special mention, (iii) substandard, (iv) doubtful or (v) loss (which are charged-off).
The ratings of loans reflect a judgment about the risks of default and loss associated with the loan. The Company reviews the ratings on our credits as part of our on-going monitoring of the credit quality of our loan portfolio. Ratings are adjusted to reflect the degree of risk and loss that are felt to be inherent in each credit as of each reporting period. Our methodology is structured so that specific allocations are increased in accordance with deterioration in credit quality (and a corresponding increase in risk and loss) or decreased in accordance with improvement in credit quality (and a corresponding decrease in risk and loss).

Credits rated special mention show clear signs of financial weaknesses or deterioration in credit worthiness, however, such concerns are not so pronounced that the Company generally expects to experience significant loss within the short-term. Such credits typically maintain the ability to perform within standard credit terms and credit exposure is not as prominent as credits rated more harshly.

Credits rated substandard are those in which the normal repayment of principal and interest may be, or has been, jeopardized by reason of adverse trends or developments of a financial, managerial, economic or political nature, or important weaknesses exist in collateral. A protracted workout on these credits is a distinct possibility. Prompt corrective action is therefore required to strengthen the Company’s

position, and/or to reduce exposure and to assure that adequate remedial measures are taken by the borrower. Credit exposure becomes more likely in such credits and a serious evaluation of the secondary support to the credit is performed.

Credits rated doubtful are those in which full collection of principal appears highly questionable, and which some degree of loss is anticipated, even though the ultimate amount of loss may not yet be certain and/or other factors exist which could affect collection of debt. Based upon available information, positive action by the Company is required to avert or minimize loss. Credits rated doubtful are generally also placed on nonaccrual.

 The Company monitors commercial, agricultural and real estate loans after such loans are 15 days past due. Consumer loans are monitored after such loans are 30 days past due.

Modifications of receivables to debtors experiencing financial difficulty

On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted the accounting guidance in ASU 2022-02, which eliminates the recognition and measurement of a TDR. Due to the removal of the TDR designation, the Company evaluates all loan restructurings according to the accounting guidance for loan modifications to determine if the restructuring results in a new loan or a continuation of the existing loan. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that result in a direct change in the timing or amount of contractual cash flows include situations where there is principal forgiveness, term extensions, interest rate reduction, and combinations of the listed modifications. Therefore, the disclosures related to loan restructurings are only for modifications that directly affect cash flows.

An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. Because the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses due to the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty was insignificant.
An analysis of the changes in loans to officers, directors, principal shareholders, or associates of such persons for the year ended 
December 31, 2024 (determined as of each respective year-end) follows (in thousands):

value option. The change to the fair value option for loans held-for-sale was effective at June 30, 2018 and was done in conjunction with the Company’s move to mandatory delivery in the secondary market and the purchase of forward mortgage-backed securities to manage the changes in fair value (see Note 5 for additional information).

These loans, which are sold on a servicing released basis, are valued using a market approach by utilizing either: (i) the fair value of the securities backed by similar mortgage loans, adjusted for certain factors to approximate the fair value of a whole mortgage loan, including the value attributable to mortgage servicing and credit risk, (ii) current commitments to purchase loans or (iii) recent observable market trades for similar loans, adjusted for credit risk and other individual loan characteristics. As these prices are derived from market observable inputs, the Company classifies these valuations as Level 2 in the fair value disclosures (see Note 10). Interest income on mortgage loans held-for-sale is recognized based on the contractual rates and reflected in interest income on loans in the consolidated statements of earnings. The Company has no continuing ownership in any of these residential mortgage loans sold.
The Company originates certain mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market. The mortgage loan sales contracts contain indemnification clauses should the loans default, generally in the first three to six months, or if documentation is determined not to be in compliance with regulations. The Company’s historic losses as a result of these indemnities have been insignificant.

5. 
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
:

The Company enters into IRLCs with customers to originate residential mortgage loans at a specific interest rate that are ultimately sold in the secondary market. These commitments, which contain fixed expiration dates, offer the borrower an interest rate guarantee provided the loan meets underwriting guidelines and closes within the timeframe established by the Company.

The Company purchases forward mortgage-backed securities contracts to manage the changes in fair value associated with changes in interest rates related to a portion of the IRLCs. These instruments are typically entered into at the time the IRLC is made in the aggregate.

The fair values of IRLCs are based on current secondary market prices for underlying loans and estimated servicing value with similar coupons, maturity and credit quality, subject to the anticipated loan funding probability (pull-through rate) net of estimated costs to originate the loan. The fair value of IRLCs is subject to change primarily due to changes in interest rates and the estimated pull-through rate. These commitments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value disclosures (see Note 10), as the valuations are based on observable market inputs.

Forward mortgage-backed securities contracts are exchange-traded or traded within highly active dealer markets. In order to determine the fair value of these instruments, the Company utilizes the exchange price or dealer market price for the particular derivative contract and these instruments are therefore classified as Level 2 in the fair value disclosures (see Note 10). The estimated fair values are subject to change primarily due to changes in interest rates. The impact of these forward contracts is included in gain on sale and fees on mortgage loans in the statement of earnings.

These financial instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. All derivatives are carried at fair value in either other assets or other liabilities, which changes in fair value recorded through earnings in the statement of earnings.

Securities sold under repurchase agreements are generally with significant customers of the Company that require short-term liquidity for their funds for which the Company pledges certain securities that have a fair value equal to at least the amount of the borrowings. The agreements mature daily and therefore the risk arising from a decline in the fair value of the collateral pledged is minimal. The securities pledged are mortgage-backed securities. These agreements do not include “right of set-off” provisions and therefore the Company does not offset such agreements for financial reporting purposes. The weighted average interest rate on federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and advances from the FHLB was 
2.01
%
 and 
3.27
%
 at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

During 2021, the Company invested in qualifying Community Development Entities ("CDE") under the federal New Market Tax Credits ("NMTC") program. See Note 9 for further discussion of our activity and related balances on the consolidated balance sheets, including the $
21,053,000
 in other borrowings shown above.

8. 
LINE OF CREDIT:
The Company renewed its loan agreement, effective June 30, 2023, with Frost Bank. Under the loan agreement, as renewed and amended, we are permitted to draw up to $
25,000,000
 on a revolving line of credit. Prior to June 30, 2025, interest will be paid quarterly at 
The Wall Street Journal 
Prime Rate and the line of credit matures 
June 30, 2025
. If a balance exists at June 30, 2025, the principal balance converts to a term facility payable quarterly over 
five
 years and interest is paid quarterly at 
The Wall Street Journal 
Prime Rate. The line of credit is unsecured. Among other provisions in the credit agreement, we must satisfy certain financial covenants during the term of the loan agreement, including, without limitation, covenants that require us to maintain certain capital, loan loss reserve, non-performing asset and cash flow coverage ratios. In addition, the credit agreement contains certain operational covenants, which among others, restricts the payment of dividends above 
55
% of consolidated net income, limits the incurrence of debt (excluding any amounts acquired in an acquisition) and prohibits the disposal of assets except in the ordinary course of business. Since 1995, we have historically declared dividends as a percentage of our consolidated net income in a range of 
36
% (low) in 2021 and 2020 to 
53
% (high) in 2003 and 2006. The Company was in compliance with the financial and operational covenants at 
December 31, 2024
. There was 
no
 outstanding balance under the line of credit as of 
December 31, 2024 or 2023
.

Low Income Housing Tax Credit Investments
 - During 2021, the Company began investing in an affordable housing fund that will invest in real estate projects that qualify for the federal low income housing tax credit (“LIHTC”) program designed to promote private development of low income housing. The investments made by the fund will generate a return to the Company primarily through the realization of LIHTCs, and also through federal tax deductions generated from the ongoing operating losses from the investees of the fund.   The Company’s investment in the fund will be amortized through income tax expense using the proportional amortization method as related tax credits are utilized by the Company. The initial capital contribution commitment to the fund was for up to $
5,500,000
. An additional capital contribution commitment was made during 2024 of $
7,000,000
. 
Contributions were $
3,925,000
 and $
615,000
 at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is included in other assets.
New Market Tax Credits
 - During 2021, the Company began investing in qualifying CDEs under the federal NMTC program. NMTC investments are made through the third-party CDEs which are qualified through the U.S. Department of the Treasury and receive periodic allocation of amounts under the NMTC program. NMTCs are generated from qualified investments by the CDEs utilizing equity investments made by a taxpayer, like the Company. Through these equity investments, the Company will receive the tax benefits from the NMTCs equal to 
39
% of the qualified investment from the CDE to qualifying eligible projects over a seven year period. The Company’s equity investments in the CD
Es is amortized using the proportional amortization method and related tax credits are allocated to the Company. At December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the consolidated balance sheet of the Company included an $
18,000,000
 loan to the investee in loans and the $
21,053,000
 leveraged loan from the investee in other borrowings (see Note 7). At 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the consolidated balance sheet of the Company included CDE investments in other assets of $
24,433,000
 and $
25,738,000
, respectively.

Current authoritative accounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Benefits from tax positions should be recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of cumulative benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no

longer meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. Current authoritative accounting guidance also provides guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of unrecognized tax benefits, interest and penalties. The Company concluded the tax benefits of positions taken and expected to be taken on its tax returns should be recognized in the financial statements under this guidance. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and state margin tax returns in the state of Texas. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2021 or Texas state tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2020. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Company believes that there are 
no
 uncertain tax positions.

10. 
FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES:
The authoritative accounting guidance for fair value measurements defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The price in the principal (or most advantageous) market used to measure the fair value of the asset or liability shall not be adjusted for transaction costs. An orderly transaction is a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets and liabilities; it is not a forced transaction. Market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are (i) independent, (ii) knowledgeable, (iii) able to transact, and (iv) willing to transact.

The authoritative accounting guidance requires the use of valuation techniques that are consistent with the market approach, the income approach and/or the cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present amount on a discounted basis. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement costs). Valuation techniques should be consistently applied. Inputs to valuation techniques refer to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Inputs may be observable, meaning those that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources, or unobservable, meaning those that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. In that regard, the authoritative guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:

•
Level 1 Inputs – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
•
Level 2 Inputs – Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (for example, interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 
•
Level 3 Inputs – Significant unobservable inputs that reflect an entity’s own assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. 
A description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below.

In general, fair value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. If such quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that primarily use, as inputs, observable market-based parameters. Valuation adjustments may be made to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value. While management believes the Company’s valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.

Securities classified as available-for-sale and trading are reported at fair value utilizing Level 1 and Level 2 inputs. For these securities, the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable

No

Certain non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include other real estate owned, goodwill and other intangible assets and other non-financial long-lived assets. Non-financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
 include other real estate owned which, subsequent to their initial transfer to other real estate owned from loans, were re-measured at fair value through a write-down included in gain (loss) on sale of foreclosed assets. During the reported periods, all fair value measurements for foreclosed assets utilized Level 2 inputs based on observable market data, generally third-party appraisals, or Level 3 inputs based on customized discounting criteria. These appraisals are evaluated individually and discounted as necessary due to the age of the appraisal, lack of comparable sales, expected holding periods of property or special use type of the property. Such discounts vary by appraisal based on the above factors but generally range from 
5
% to 
25
% of the appraised value. Re-evaluation of other real estate owned is performed at least annually as required by regulatory guidelines or more often if particular circumstances arise. There were no significant other real estate owned properties that were re-measured subsequent to their initial transfer to other real estate owned during the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023.

At December 31, 2024 and 2023
, other real estate owned totaled $
811,000
 and $
483,000
, respectively. At December 31, 2022, the Company had 
no
 other real estate owned.

The Company is required under current authoritative accounting guidance to disclose the estimated fair value of their financial instrument assets and liabilities including those subject to the requirements discussed above. For the Company, as for most financial institutions, substantially all of its assets and liabilities are considered financial instruments. Many of the Company’s financial instruments, however, lack an available trading market as characterized by a willing buyer and willing seller engaging in an exchange transaction.

The estimated fair value amounts of financial instruments have been determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required to interpret data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

In addition, reasonable comparability between financial institutions may not be likely due to the wide range of permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates that must be made given the absence of active secondary markets for many of the financial instruments. This lack of uniform valuation methodologies also introduces a greater degree of subjectivity to these estimated fair values.

Cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits in banks and accrued interest receivable and payable are liquid in nature and considered Levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Financial instruments with stated maturities have been valued using a present value discounted cash flow with a discount rate approximating current market for similar assets and liabilities and are considered Levels 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Financial instrument liabilities with no stated maturities have an estimated fair value equal to both the amount payable on demand and the carrying value and are considered Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:
The Company is engaged in legal actions arising from the normal course of business. In management’s opinion, the Company has adequate legal defenses with respect to these actions, and as of December 31, 2024 the resolution of these matters is not expected to have material adverse effects upon the results of operations or financial condition of the Company.

The Company leases a portion of its bank premises and equipment under operating leases. At December 31, 2024, future minimum lease commitments were: 2025 - 
$
525,000
, 2026 - $
201,000
, 2027 - $

 and

ne thereafter.

12. 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH  OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK:
We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers. These financial instruments include unfunded lines of credit, commitments to extend credit and federal funds sold to correspondent banks and standby letters of credit. Those instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s reserve for unfunded commitments totaled 
$
8,677,000
 and $
7,903,000
, respectively, which is recorded in other liabilities.

Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the financial instrument for unfunded lines of credit, commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of these instruments. 
We generally use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance sheet instruments. Commitments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, are shown below (dollars in thousands):

The above table also does not include balances related to the Company’s IRLCs and forward mortgage-backed security trades.

Unfunded lines of credit and commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We evaluate each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, as we deem necessary upon extension of credit, is based on our credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant, and equipment and income-producing commercial properties.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments we issue to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third-party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The average collateral value held on letters of credit usually exceeds the contract amount.

We believe we have no other off-balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated, special purpose entities that would expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of the financial statements.

13. 
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK:
The Company grants commercial, retail, agriculture and residential real estate loans to customers primarily in North Central, Southeastern and West Texas. Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of its borrowers’ ability to honor their commitments is dependent upon each local economic sector. In addition, the Company holds mortgage related securities which are guaranteed by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC or are collateralized by loans backed by these agencies.

14. 
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:
The Company also provides a 401(k) plan and profit sharing plan, a qualified defined contribution plan, which covers substantially all full-time employees. The 401(k) feature allows employees to contribute a percentage of their base annual salary with a corresponding employer match. The profit sharing feature includes an employee stock ownership feature (“ESOP”). Employees are fully vested to the extent of their contributions and become fully vested in the Company’s profit sharing contributions over a 
six-year
 vesting period.

The Company matches a maximum of 
4
% on employee deferrals of 
5
% of their employee compensation. Total expense for this match in 
2024, 2023 and 2022 was 
$
3,924,000
, 
$
3,750,000
 and 
$
3,675,000
, respectively, and is included in salaries and employee benefits in the statements of earnings.
Costs related to the Company’s profit sharing plan totaled approximately 
$
9,466,000
, 
$
1,373,000
 and 
$
4,233,000
 in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are included in salaries and employee benefits in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the profit sharing plan’s ESOP assets included First Financial Bankshares, Inc. common stock of 
1,972,996
 and 
2,061,918
 shares valued at approximately 
$
71,584,000
 and 
$
62,476,000
, respectively.

The Company has a non-qualified “excess benefit” plan where executives, whose Company contributions to the profit sharing plan and employer match under the 401(k) feature are curtailed due to Internal Revenue Service limitations, received contributions from the Company equal to the amount under qualified plans as if there had been no Internal Revenue Service limitations. This plan used the same contribution formula and vesting requirements as the 401(k) and profit sharing plan. This "Make Whole Plan" was frozen to new participants and contributions effective December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Make Whole Plan held 
114,495
 and 
117,447
 shares, respectively, in trust for the Company’s executives. There were 
no
 contributions to this plan during the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

The Company adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”), effective January 1, 2019, which was amended effective January 1, 2022. The SERP benefits certain key senior executives of the Company who are selected by the Board to participate. The SERP is intended to provide a benefit from the Company upon retirement, death, disability or voluntary or involuntary termination of services (other than “for cause”). Under the SERP, the Company may, but is not required to, make discretionary contributions to the executive’s accounts from time to time. The contributions may be fully vested or subject to vesting conditions imposed by the Board of

Directors with respect to the contributions; provided, however, that all unvested amounts credited to an executive’s account will become fully vested upon the executive’s death or disability or upon the occurrence of a change of control (as defined in the SERP). Company contributions to the SERP on behalf of an executive are credited with earnings and losses based on the executive’s investment elections. The investment options under the SERP are currently the same as those offered under the Company’s profit sharing plan, except that Company stock can not be purchased as an investment option under the SERP. An executive’s vested account is payable to the participant following his or her termination in a single lump sum or installments, as elected by the participant. The SERP as amended allows selected participants to defer base and incentive compensation as well as the receipt of shares from vested restricted and performance stock units into the plan. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, other assets on the consolidated balance sheet include 
$
5,230,000
 and 
$
3,518,000
 of SERP balances, respectively. The Company made contributions totaling 
$
391,000
, 
$
198,000
 and 
$
445,000
 to the SERP for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, subsequent to the respective year ends, for certain executive officers.

The Company has a directors’ deferred compensation plan whereby the directors may elect to defer up to 
100
% of their directors’ fees. All deferred compensation is invested in the Company’s common stock held in a rabbi trust wherein the funds are used to purchase Company common shares on the open market. The stock is held in nominee name of the trustee, and the principal and earnings of the trust are held separate and apart from other funds of the Company and are used exclusively for the uses and purposes of the deferred compensation agreement. The accounts of the trust have been consolidated in the financial statements of the Company. As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, the rabbi trust held 
929,735
 and 
930,152
 shares, respectively, in trust for the Company’s directors and are reflected as treasury shares on the consolidated financial statements.

The Company has acquired life insurance policies on certain current and former executives and directors of acquired entities. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, other assets on the consolidated balance sheet include 
$
33,895,000
 and 
$
34,136,000
 and reported cash value income (net of related insurance premium expenses) of 
$
1,810,000
, 
$
891,000
 and 
$
836,000
 in 
2024, 2023 and 2022
, respectively.

15. 
DIVIDENDS FROM SUBSIDIARIES:
At December 31, 2024, 
$
428,661,000
 was available for the declaration of dividends by the Company’s subsidiaries without the prior approval of regulatory agencies.

16. 
REGULATORY MATTERS:
Banking regulators measure capital adequacy by means of the risk-based capital ratios and the leverage ratio under the Basel III regulatory capital framework and prompt corrective action regulations. The risk-based capital rules provide for the weighting of assets and off-balance-sheet commitments and contingencies according to prescribed risk categories. Regulatory capital is then divided by risk-weighted assets to determine the risk-adjusted capital ratios. The leverage ratio is computed by dividing shareholders’ equity less intangible assets by quarter-to-date average assets less intangible assets.

As of January 1, 2019, a 
2.5
% capital conservation buffer Basel III was fully phased in. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress and requires increased capital levels for the purpose of capital distributions and other payments. Failure to meet the amount of the buffer will result in restrictions on the Company’s ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had a total risk-based capital ratio of 
20.00
% and 
19.62
%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 
18.83
% and 
18.50
%; a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 
18.83
% and 
18.50
%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 
12.49
% and 
12.06
%, respectively. The regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were calculated under Basel III rules.
As of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, the regulatory capital ratios of the Company and Bank under the Basel III regulatory capital framework are as follows:

Performance Stock Units
Also under the 2021 Plan, the Company awards performance-based restricted stock units ("PSUs") to executive officers and other officers and employees. Under the terms of the award, the number of units that will vest and convert to shares of common stock will be based on the extent to which the Company achieves specific performance criteria during the fixed 
three-year
 performance period. The number of shares issued upon vesting will range from 
0
% to 
200
% of the PSUs granted. The PSUs vest at the end of a three-year period based on either 
50
% each on average adjusted earnings per share growth and return on average assets, or 
100
% return on average assets, as reported, adjusted for unusual gains/losses, merger expenses, and other items as approved by the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors. Performance for each period is measured relative to other U.S. publicly traded banks with $
10
 billion to $
50
 billion in assets. Compensation expense for the PSUs will be estimated each period based on the fair value of the stock at the grant date and the probable outcome of the performance condition, adjusted for passage of time within the vesting period of the awards.

Stock Option Plan
Prior to approval of the 2021 Plan, the 2012 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "2012 Plan") provided for the granting of options to employees of the Company at prices not less than market value at the date of the grant. The 2012 Plan provided that options granted vest and are exercisable after 
two years
 from the date of grant and vest at a rate of 
20
% each year thereafter and have a 
10-year
 term. The most recent grants from the 2021 Plan provided that 
20
% of the options granted vest and are exercisable after one year from the date of grant and the remaining options vest and are exercisable at a rate of 
20
% each year thereafter and have a 
10-year
 term. Shares are issued under the 2012 Plan and the 2021 Plan from available authorized shares.
