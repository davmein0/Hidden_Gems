Other Business Activities
Impairment
During the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the Company evaluated economic conditions subsequent to the date of our annual impairment assessment on April 1, 2023, including competition in the market and inflationary pressures, which increased during the second quarter of 2023, and impacted the performance and outlook of Presque Isle Downs and Casino ("Presque Isle"). As a result, the Company concluded that a trigger event for impairment testing occurred related to the Presque Isle gaming rights, trademark, and the reporting unit's goodwill at the end of the second quarter. Based on the trigger event, the Company evaluated and subsequently updated the projected cash flows and discount rate to reflect the economic environment at that time. As a result, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $24.5 million in the second quarter of 2023 for the Presque Isle gaming rights and trademark. For additional information, refer to Note 7, Asset Impairments to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Key Indicators to Evaluate Business Results and Financial Condition
Our management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition. These indicators include changes in net revenue, operating expense, operating income, earnings per share, outstanding debt balance, operating cash flow and capital spend.
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). We also use non-GAAP measures, including EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA as a key performance measure of results of operations enables management and investors to evaluate and compare from period to period our operating performance in a meaningful and consistent manner. Our chief operating decision maker utilizes Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate segment performance, develop strategy, and allocate resources. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our operating results.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the following:
Adjusted EBITDA includes our portion of EBITDA from our equity investments and the portion of EBITDA attributable to a noncontrolling interest.
Adjusted EBITDA excludes:
• Transaction expense, net which includes:
– Acquisition, disposition, and property sale related charges;
– Other transaction expense, including legal, accounting and other deal-related expense;
• Stock-based compensation expense;
•
 Rivers Des Plaines' impact on our investments in unconsolidated affiliates from:
– Legal reserves and transaction costs;
• Asset impairments;
• Gain on property sales;
• Legal reserves;
32
• Pre-opening expense; and
• Other charges, recoveries and expenses
As of December 31, 2021, Arlington International Racecourse ("Arlington") ceased racing and simulcast operations and the property was sold on February 15, 2023 to the Chicago Bears. Arlington's results and exit costs in 2023 are treated as an adjustment.
On June 26, 2023, the Company's management agreement for Lady Luck in Farmington, Pennsylvania expired and was not renewed. 
For segment reporting, Adjusted EBITDA includes intercompany revenue and expense totals that are eliminated in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. See the Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA included in this section for additional information.
