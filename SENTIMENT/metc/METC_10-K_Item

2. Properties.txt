Summary Overview of Mining Operations
​
Information concerning our mining properties in this Annual Report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, which requires us to disclose our mineral resources, in addition to our mineral reserves, as of the end of our most recently completed fiscal year both in the aggregate and for each of our individually material mining properties.
​
As used in this Annual Report, the terms “mineral resource,” “measured mineral resource,” “indicated mineral resource,” “inferred mineral resource,” “mineral reserve,” “proven mineral reserve” and “probable mineral reserve” are defined and used in accordance with subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. Under subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K, mineral resources may not be classified as “mineral reserves” unless the determination has been made by a qualified person that the indicated and measured mineral resources can be the basis of an economically viable project. You are specifically cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral resources will ever be converted into mineral reserves, as defined by the SEC. See “Item 1A “Risk Factors”
​
You are cautioned that, except for that portion of mineral resources classified as mineral reserves, mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic value. Inferred mineral resources are estimates based on limited geological evidence and sampling and have a too high of a degree of uncertainty as to their existence to apply relevant technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospects of economic extraction in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability. Estimates of inferred mineral resources may not be converted to a mineral reserve. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. A significant amount of exploration must be completed in order to determine whether an inferred mineral resource may be upgraded to a higher category. Therefore, you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists, that it can be the basis of an economically viable project, or that it will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Likewise, you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated mineral resources will ever be converted to mineral reserves. See “Item 1A “Risk Factors”
​
The information that follows relating to the Elk Creek Complex, Berwind Complex, Knox Creek Complex, and Maben Complex is derived, for the most part, from, and in some instances is an extract from, the technical report summaries (“TRS”) relating to such properties prepared in compliance with the Item 601(b)(96) and subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. Portions of the following information are based on assumptions, qualifications and procedures that are not fully described herein. Reference should be made to the full text of the TRSs, incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this Annual Report.

​
At December 31, 2024, we owned or controlled, primarily through long-term leases, approximately 174,750 acres of coal in Virginia and West Virginia and 1,567 acres of coal in Pennsylvania. The aggregate annual production for our properties during the three most recently completed fiscal years are as follows: 3.7 million tons for fiscal year 2024, 3.2 million tons for fiscal year 2023, and 2.7 million tons for fiscal year 2022. Our preparation plants and loadout facilities are located on properties owned by us or held under leases which expire at varying dates over the next 30 years. Most of the leases contain options to renew. Many of these leases provide for a royalty payment to the lessor based on a specific price per ton of coal extracted or as a percentage of coal sales revenue. We believe that all of our leases were entered into at market terms.
​
The Company leases office space in Lexington, Kentucky, which serves as our executive headquarters as well as Charleston, West Virgina, which serves as an operations center. The Company also owns offices in Sheridan, Wyoming. See Item 1. “Business - Our Projects” for additional information about our mining operations and Wyoming initiatives.
​
We hold numerous environmental and mineral extraction permits, water rights and other permits, licenses and approvals from governmental authorities authorizing operations at each of our facilities. With respect to each facility at which we produce coal, permits, licenses and approvals are obtained as needed in the normal course of business based on our mine plans and federal, state, and local regulatory provisions regarding mine permitting and licensing. Based on our historical permitting experience, we expect to be able to continue to obtain necessary mining permits and approvals to support historical rates of production.
​
We are the operators of the mining and processing operations and the mining methods we use consist of surface, underground and highwall mining methods. The mining operations for the Elk Creek, Berwind, Knox Creek, and Maben complexes are material to our business and are further described below.

Elk Creek Complex
​
The Elk Creek Complex is located approximately 45 miles south of Charleston, West Virginia, in Logan, Wyoming, and Mingo Counties at N 37.698718, W 81.778297. The nearest town is Man, West Virginia, which is approximately five miles to the northwest of the Elk Creek Complex. The Elk Creek Complex is within the Southern West Virginia coal field of the Central Appalachia Coal Producing Region (the “CAPP Region”) of the United States.
​
Companies that previously mined on the Elk Creek Complex include Island Creek Coal Company (“Island Creek”) which started mining in the area in December 1904. Consolidation Coal Company, now known as Consol Energy, Inc. (“Consol”), bought Island Creek in July 1993 and continued operations in and around the area until the late-1990s when Consol idled its Elk Creek Mine. Ramaco Coal bought the property from Consol in 2012 and started production on the Elk Creek Complex in the fourth quarter of 2016. The 2012 purchase included acquisition of rail access, permitted impoundment and coal refuse disposal facilities, as well as numerous reclaimed, but permitted deep mines. Pittston Coal Company operated mines on the northern Huff Creek portion (McDonald and Baisden properties) of the Elk Creek Complex in the 1970s and 1980s before the company exited the coal mining business in 2001.
​
The Elk Creek Complex consists of approximately 20,200 acres of leased coal holdings. Within the Elk Creek Complex controlled coal holdings, 16,000 acres lie in Logan County, 2,800 acres in Wyoming County and 1,400 acres in Mingo County. The Elk Creek Complex is in the production stage and currently has seven active mines, two planned and permitted mines, two permitted inactive mines, and one planned but not permitted mine. The four planned and/or permitted mines include one contour surface mine developing area for a highwall miner, and three underground room and pillar mines, which use continuous miners for mine development. Ramaco began production of metallurgical coal at the complex in 2016. A majority of the underground mines implement retreat mining, which results in mining recovery of greater than 80 percent. Contour mining has an average mining recovery of approximately 90 percent, and the highwall mines have an average mining recovery of approximately 40 percent.
​
The Elk Creek Complex is mining several seams and seam splits, including the Chilton A, Upper Dorothy, Upper Dorothy 2, 3, and 4, Middle Dorothy, Lower Dorothy, Upper Cedar Grove, Lower Cedar Grove A, Lower Cedar Grove B, Lower Cedar Grove C, Upper Alma, Lower Alma, Powellton, Eagle, and No. 2 Gas seams, in descending stratigraphic order. 
​
Currently, there are seven active mines within the complex:
●
Ram No. 1 Surface and Highwall Mine
●
Ram No. 3 Surface and Highwall Mine
●
Stonecoal No. 2 Alma Deep Mine
●
Rockhouse Eagle Deep Mine
●
No. 2 Gas Deep Mine
●
Michael Powellton Deep Mine
●
Crucible Deep Mine Lower Cedar Grove B and C seams
​
There are two planned and permitted mines within the complex:
●
Ram No. 2 Surface and Highwall Mine (which is the extension of Ram No. 1 above), scheduled for late 2025 startup
●
Glen Alum Tunnel #1 Deep Mine, scheduled for 2027 startup
​
There are two permitted inactive mines, the Eight-Kay Deep Mine that is projected to start in 2027 as well as the Monarch Deep Mine that is scheduled to start in 2026. The Bens Creek Deep Mine is planned but is not yet permitted. The projected startup date for this mine is 2028. It is likely future mines will be planned and scheduled, as necessary, from resource areas within the complex, to meet internal Ramaco production goals aligned with market conditions. With the exception of the Ram No. 2 mine, all planned mines are subject to future Board approval.
​
The current Elk Creek Complex Life-of-Mine (“LOM”) Plan projects mining through 2040; an expected mine life for the complex of 15 years. However, it is likely that future mines will be planned and scheduled, as necessary, to meet our production goals aligned with market conditions.

​
All Run-of-Mine (“ROM”) coal is washed at the Elk Creek Preparation Plant. The Elk Creek Preparation Plant, built in 2017 by Raw Resources Group located in Princeton, West Virginia, is a well designed and constructed preparation plant, with ROM processing capacity of 700 tons per hour. During 2022, we began work on a throughput upgrade at our Elk Creek Preparation plant. We completed the expansion in 2023, which raised the nameplate processing capacity to 1,050 raw tons per hour and our annual processing capacity from this complex to approximately three million tons per year. 
​
In order to utilize the increased capacity, we also completed development work on additional low-cost, high- volatile mines at Elk Creek during 2024, including the Ram 3 surface/highwall mine and the third section at the Stonecoal Alma mine, both of which were at full production by the end of the third quarter of 2024.
​
The gross book value of the Elk Creek Complex property and its associated plant and equipment was $331 million as of December 31, 2024. The Elk Creek Complex utilizes industry standard, modern surface and underground mining equipment, processing equipment, and infrastructure that is in good operating condition and capable of meeting planned production requirements using prudent operating methods and operating schedules.
​
The Elk Creek Complex produces high-quality, high-volatile metallurgical coal. Historically, the market for metallurgical coal from the Elk Creek Complex has been domestic metallurgical coal consumers and the global seaborne metallurgical coal market. Coal produced from the complex is primarily high-volatile A and high-volatile B metallurgical coal. The Elk Creek Complex also produces thermal coal and specialty coals, which represent approximately five percent of sales.
​
Volatiles refers to the volatile matter contained in the coal. Classification of coal as low, mid or high-volatile refers to the specific volatile content within the coal, with coals of 17% to 22% volatile matter being classified as low-volatile, 23% to 31% as mid-volatile and 32% or greater as high-volatile. The volatile matter in coal impacts coke yield (i.e., the amount of coke and coke by-products produced per ton of coal charged). Low-volatile coal contains more carbon, but too much carbon can result in coke oven damage. Too much volatile matter results in less carbon and reduces the volume of coke produced. Therefore, coke producers use blends of high-volatile and low-volatile coals for coke production.
​
We are unaware of any significant encumbrances to the Elk Creek Complex, including current and future permitting requirements and associated timelines, permit conditions, and violations and fines.
​
Berwind Complex 
​
The Berwind Complex is located approximately 80 miles south of Charleston, West Virginia; 100 miles west of Roanoke, Virginia; 60 miles northeast of Kingsport, Tennessee; and 160 miles east/southeast of Lexington, Kentucky at N 37.164522, W 81.744893. The complex includes areas in Buchanan and Tazewell Counties, Virginia and McDowell County, West Virginia. The Berwind Complex is within the Southwestern Virginia and Southern West Virginia coal fields of the CAPP Region of the United States.
​
The Berwind Complex and surrounding area have an extensive history of coal mining, primarily by underground mining methods. Mining within the Berwind/Knox Creek Complex likely began in the early-1900s and there have been many different mine operators both large and small in the region since then.
​
The Berwind Property consists of approximately 62,500 acres of leased coal holdings located in McDowell County, West Virginia and Buchanan and Tazewell Counties, Virginia. Ramaco obtained its initial lease for this property in 2015 and commenced mine operations in 2017. The Berwind Complex is in the production stage and currently has two active mines. The mines that were active at December 31, 2024 are underground room and pillar mines, which use continuous miners for mine development. 
​
Ramaco started operations at the Berwind Pocahontas 4 Deep Mine in 2017 and idled the mine in mid-July 2022 due to an ignition that an investigation by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) suggests was

caused by lightning that struck a pilot hole for a new shaft. Production at the Berwind No. 1 Deep Mine restarted in the first quarter of 2023. The Company continues to increase production at the main Berwind low-volatile mine.
A majority of the underground mines implement retreat mining, which typically results in mining recovery of greater than 80 percent. Contour mining has an average mining recovery of approximately 90 percent, and the highwall mine has an average mining recovery of approximately 40 percent.
​
The Berwind Complex is mining several seams and seam splits, including the Pocahontas 6, Pocahontas 5, Pocahontas 4 and Pocahontas 3 seams, in descending stratigraphic order.
​
Active Mines:
●
Laurel Fork Pocahontas 3 Deep Mine
●
Berwind No. 1 Pocahontas 4 Deep Mine
​
Permitted Mines:
●
Squire Jim No. 1 Deep Mine, permitted but not planned for startup
​
The current Berwind Complex Life-of-Mine (LOM) Plan projects mining through 2049, an expected mine life for the complex of over 20 years. However, it is likely that future mines will be planned and scheduled, as necessary, from resource areas within the complex, to meet internal Ramaco production goals aligned with market conditions.
​
All Run-of-Mine (ROM) coal is washed at the Berwind Preparation Plant with no planned direct shipment coal. The Berwind Preparation Plant was initially built in 1955 and commissioned in 1957. Ramaco refurbished the preparation plant in 2021 and 2022 based on a design by Ramsey Industrial, with a current ROM processing capacity of 600 tons per hour. 
​
The gross book value of the Berwind Complex property and its associated plant and equipment was $178 million as of December 31, 2024. The Berwind Complex utilizes industry standard, modern surface and underground mining equipment, processing equipment, and infrastructure that is in good operating condition and capable of meeting planned production requirements using prudent operating methods and operating schedules.
​
The Berwind Complex produces high-quality, mid and low-volatile metallurgical coal. Historically, the market for metallurgical coal from the Berwind Complex has been for both domestic metallurgical coal consumers and the global seaborne metallurgical coal market. 
​
We are unaware of any significant encumbrances to the Berwind Complex, including current and future permitting requirements and associated timelines, permit conditions, and violations and fines.
​
Knox Creek Complex 
​
The Knox Creek Complex consists of two general properties or areas as follows:
●
Big Creek Property
●
Knox Creek Property
​
The Knox Creek Complex is located approximately 80 miles south of Charleston, West Virginia; 100 miles west of Roanoke, Virginia; 60 miles northeast of Kingsport, Tennessee; and 160 miles east/southeast of Lexington, Kentucky at N 37.164522, W 81.744893. The complex includes areas in Buchanan, Russell and Tazewell Counties, Virginia and McDowell County, West Virginia. The Knox Creek Complex is within the Southwestern Virginia and Southern West Virginia coal fields of the CAPP Region of the United States.
​
The Knox Creek Complex and surrounding area have an extensive history of coal mining, primarily by underground mining methods. Mining within the Knox Creek Complex likely began in the early-1900s and there have been many different mine operators both large and small in the region since then.
​
69

Table of Contents
The Knox Creek Complex consists of approximately 64,050 acres of owned and leased coal holdings. Within the Knox Creek Complex controlled coal holdings, 5,370 acres lie in McDowell County, West Virginia. The Knox Creek Complex is in the production stage and currently has one active mine and two planned and permitted mines. There are no active or planned West Virginia mines currently within the Knox Creek Complex. The single active mine is a contour surface mine developing areas for a highwall miner. The Company closed the Jawbone No. 1 Deep Mine during 2024, which was nearing end of mine life and experiencing higher cost production.
​
Ramaco began production of metallurgical coal at the complex in 2019. The underground mines will implement retreat mining, which typically results in mining recovery of 50 to 80 percent. At the surface mine, contour mining has an average mining recovery of approximately 90 percent, and highwall mining has an average mining recovery of approximately 40 percent.
​
The Knox Creek Complex is mining or plans to mine several seams and seam splits, including the Jawbone, Kennedy and Tiller seams.
​
Active Mine:
●
Big Creek Surface and Highwall Mine
​
Planned and Permitted Mines:
●
Knox Creek Tiller Deep Mine, scheduled for 2029 startup
●
Kennedy No. 3 Deep Mine, scheduled for 2029 startup
​
Closed Mines:
●
Big Creek Jawbone No. 1 Deep Mine was active during most of 2024, but was closed later in the year and is no longer active
​
The current Knox Creek Complex Life-of-Mine (LOM) Plan projects mining through 2037, an expected mine life for the complex of 12 years. It is anticipated that future mines will be planned and scheduled, as necessary, from resource areas within the complex, to meet internal Ramaco production goals aligned with market conditions. Both planned mines listed above are subject to future Board approval.
​
All Run-of-Mine (ROM) coal is washed at the Knox Creek Preparation Plant. The Knox Creek Preparation Plant, built in 1981 by Powell Construction Company located in Johnson City, Tennessee, is a well designed and constructed preparation plant, with ROM processing capacity of 750 tons per hour. 
​
The gross book value of the Knox Creek Complex property and its associated plant and equipment was $34 million as of December 31, 2024. The Knox Creek Complex utilizes industry standard, modern surface and underground mining equipment, processing equipment, and infrastructure that is in good operating condition and capable of meeting planned production requirements using prudent operating methods and operating schedules.
​
The Knox Creek Complex produces high-quality, mid and high-volatile metallurgical coal. Historically, the market for metallurgical coal from the Knox Creek Complex has included both domestic metallurgical coal consumers and the global seaborne metallurgical coal market. The Knox Creek Complex also sporadically produces a minimal quantity of thermal coal from the surface mine from oxidized zones.
​
We are unaware of any significant encumbrances to the Knox Creek Complex, including current and future permitting requirements and associated timelines, permit conditions, and violations and fines.
​
Maben Complex
​
The Maben Complex is located approximately 52 miles south of Charleston, WV. The complex includes areas in Wyoming and Raleigh County, West Virginia.
​
70

Table of Contents
The Maben Complex and surrounding area have an extensive history of coal mining, primarily by contour surface and underground mining methods. Mining within the area likely began in the early-1900s, and there have been many different mine operators both large and small in the region since then. The Maben Coal Company, unrelated to Ramaco, was one of the primary operators on the Maben property and in the region. Pocahontas Coal Company also had a presence in the region.
​
The Maben property consists of approximately 28,000 acres of controlled mineral rights acquired from the purchase of Maben Coal in the third quarter of 2022 from Appleton Coal, LLC. As part of the transaction, we assumed existing mining permits issued by the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection, which authorizes mining by both surface and highwall mining methods as well as by underground methods. We also assumed issued permits covering an existing haul road, as well as an active refuse disposal area together with a preparation plant and unit train loadout, neither of which had been constructed at the closing date. During 2024, the Company completed the purchase of an existing coal preparation plant and relocated the plant to the Maben Complex, which was commissioned early in the fourth quarter.
​
The Maben Complex is in the production stage and currently has one active mine and three planned underground mines.
​
Active Mine:
●
Maben Surface and Highwall Mine
​
Planned and Permitted Mines:
●
Beckley Crystal Deep Mine, scheduled for 2026 startup
●
Allen Creek Mine No. 1, scheduled for 2028 startup
​
Planned and Unpermitted Mine:
●
Slick Rock Sewell Deep Mine, scheduled for late 2026 startup
​
The current expected mine life for the complex is 15 years; however, it is anticipated that future mines will be planned and scheduled, as necessary, from resource areas within the complex, to meet internal Ramaco production goals aligned with market conditions.
​
The gross book value of the Maben Complex property and its associated plant and equipment was $24 million as of December 31, 2024. The Maben Complex utilizes industry standard, modern surface and highwall mining equipment, processing equipment, and infrastructure that is in good operating condition and capable of meeting planned production requirements using prudent operating methods and operating schedules.
​
The Maben Complex produces high-quality, low-volatile metallurgical coal, which serves both domestic metallurgical coal consumers and the global seaborne metallurgical coal market.
​
We are unaware of any significant encumbrances to the Maben Complex, including current and future permitting requirements and associated timelines, permit conditions, and violations and fines.

​
Our coal resource and reserve estimates at December 31, 2024, were prepared by a qualified person (“QP”) and have a basis in periodic, historical reserve studies completed by third-party geological engineering firms. Our coal resource 
73

Table of Contents
and reserve estimates are based on data obtained from our drilling activities and other available geologic data. Acquisitions or sales of coal properties will change these estimates. Changes in mining methods or the utilization of new technologies may increase or decrease the recovery basis for a coal seam. The most recent studies of our coal reserves for the Elk Creek Complex, Berwind Complex, Knox Creek Complex, and Maben Complex were prepared by an independent engineering firm, Weir International, Inc. (“Weir”). In periods between third party updates, we update reserves utilizing our internal staff of engineers and geologists based on production data. We intend to continue to periodically retain outside experts to assist management with the verification of our estimates of our coal reserves going forward.
​
Weir prepared our reserve reporting in compliance with the Regulation S-K 1300 requirements. Weir initiated this process with us by completing a historical project review as well as its validation of our complete drill hole database. Weir validated that property control is accurately reflected in reserve modeling, verifying the latest property boundaries, including control by each seam. Weir also examined reserve boundaries to ensure agreement with mining parameters, such as minimum thickness, minimum yield and minimum inter-burden between seams. Resource classification is determined based on the expectation of our meeting these mining parameters. Weir also conducted mining integrity checks to ensure each reserve area is minable.
​
In determining whether our reserves meet this standard, we take into account, among other things, our potential ability to obtain a mining permit, the possible necessity of revising a mining plan, changes in estimated future costs, changes in future cash flows caused by changes in costs required to be incurred to meet regulatory requirements and obtaining or renewing mining permits, variations in quantity and quality of coal, and varying levels of demand and their effects on selling prices. Further, the economic recoverability of our reserves is based on market conditions including contracted pricing, market pricing and overall demand for our coal. Thus, the actual value at which we no longer consider our reserves to be economically recoverable varies depending on the length of time in which the specific market conditions are expected to last. We consider our reserves to be economically recoverable at a price in excess of our cash costs to mine the coal and fund our ongoing replacement capital. The reserves in this Annual Report are classified by reliability or accuracy in decreasing order of geological assurance as Proven (Measured) and Probable (Indicated). 
​
Summaries of the mineral resources and mineral reserves as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are shown below. Weir served as the QP and prepared the estimates of mineral resources and mineral reserves at the Berwind Complex, Knox Creek Complex, Elk Creek Complex, and Maben Complex. Since a material change has not occurred from the last TRS filed for each of the Berwind, Knox Creek, and Elk Creek complexes, the previous years’ TRSs have not been updated. Refer to Exhibit 96.1, 96.2, and 96.3 for access to the previous TRS for the Berwind Complex, Knox Creek Complex, and Elk Creek Complex, respectively. Refer to Exhibit 96.4 for the TRS for the Maben Complex.

Estimates of coal reserves and resources are updated annually to reflect changes resulting from active mine production, mine plan modifications, property acquisitions/sales, impacts of additional exploration drilling, and any other changes that impact remaining coal reserve and resource tonnage. 
​
The combined proven and probable reserves increased by 7 million tons and measured and indicated in-place resources increased by 233 million tons during 2024, both of which were driven by the completion of reserves and resources assessments for the first time for the Maben Complex.

​
Key assumptions and parameters relating to the mineral resources and mineral reserves are discussed in sections 11 and 12, respectively, of each TRS.
​
Exploration Target
​
Brook Mine is an exploration property that includes three drillhole programs involving a total of 124 new core drillholes, targeting rare earth elements and critical minerals within the current Brook Mine permit area. So far, the results of these drilling programs and related chemical, metallurgical, and mineralogy testing, indicate elevated levels of rare earth elements neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium along with significant concentrations of critical minerals gallium, and germanium, and scandium. Work is ongoing to evaluate the potential extraction of these resources within the current Brook Mine permit area and to conclude whether such activities would be commercially feasible. The Company anticipates completing its techno-economic analysis of the overall commercial aspects of the potential opportunity in 2025 and anticipates beginning construction of a demonstration processing facility in mid to late 2025.
​
There has been insufficient analysis of the Brook Mine to estimate a mineral resource and it is unclear, at present, whether further exploration and analysis will result in the estimation of a mineral resource. The exploration target therefore does not represent, and should not be construed to be, an estimate of a mineral resource or mineral reserve as such terms are used in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K. 
​
Internal Controls
​
In our exploration and mineral resource and reserve estimation efforts, we utilize a certified American National Standards Institute third-party laboratory, which has in-house quality control and assurance procedures. Once in possession of the samples, the laboratory standard sample preparation and security procedures are followed. After the sample has been tested, reviewed, and accepted, the disposal of the sample is done in accordance with local, state and EPA approved methods. 
​
Weir has determined the sample preparation, security and analysis procedures used for our drillhole samples meet current coal industry standards and practices for quality testing, with laboratory results suitable to use for geological modeling, mineral resource estimation and economic evaluation.
​
Year-end reserve estimates are and will continue to be reviewed by our Chief Executive Officer and other senior management, and revisions are communicated to our board of directors. Inaccuracies in our estimates of our coal reserves could result in decreased profitability from lower-than-expected revenue or higher-than-expected costs. Actual production recovered from identified reserve areas and properties, and revenue and expenditures associated with our mining operations, may vary materially from estimates.
​
