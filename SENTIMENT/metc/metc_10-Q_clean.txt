CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this
“Quarterly Report”) includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“Exchange Act”). All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this report, regarding our strategy,
future operations, financial position, estimated revenue and losses, projected costs, prospects, plans, and objectives of management
are forward-looking statements. When used in this Quarterly Report, the words “could,” “believe,” “anticipate,”
“intend,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project” and similar expressions are intended to identify
forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. These forward-looking statements
are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions about future events and are based on currently available information
as to the outcome and timing of future events. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors
and other cautionary statements described under, but not limited to, the heading “Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in this
Quarterly Report and elsewhere in the Annual Report of Ramaco Resources, Inc. (the “Company”) on Form 10-K for

other risks identified in this Quarterly Report and in our Form
                                            10-K that are not historical.

We caution you that these forward-looking statements
are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control,
incident to the development, production, gathering and sale of coal. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing
environment and additional risks may arise from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all of the risks associated
with our business, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors,
may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Although we believe
that our plans, intentions, and expectations reflected in or suggested by the forward-looking statements we make in this Quarterly Report
are reasonable, we can give no assurance that these plans, intentions, or expectations will be achieved or occur, and actual results
could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties,
investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

All forward-looking statements, expressed or
implied, included in this Quarterly Report are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement and speak only as of
the date of this Quarterly Report. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral
forward-looking statements that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue.

Except as otherwise required by applicable law,
we disclaim any duty to update any forward-looking statements, all of which are expressly qualified by the statements in this section,
to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report.

Ramaco Resources, Inc.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1—BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Ramaco Resources, Inc. (the
“Company,” “Ramaco,” “we,” “us” or “our,”) is a Delaware corporation
formed in October 2016. Our principal corporate and executive offices are located in Lexington, Kentucky with operational offices in
Charleston, West Virginia and Sheridan, Wyoming. We are an operator and developer of high-quality, low-cost metallurgical coal in
southern West Virginia and southwestern Virginia. Our metallurgical coal development portfolio primarily includes the following
properties: Elk Creek, Berwind, Knox Creek, and Maben. We believe each of these properties possesses geologic and logistical
advantages that make our coal among the lowest delivered-cost U.S. metallurgical coal to our domestic customer base, North American
blast furnace steel mills and coke plants, as well as international metallurgical coal consumers. In June 2025, we initiated
development of our rare earth element and critical mineral operations near Sheridan, Wyoming (the “Brook Mine”). That mine has initially begun to produce representative ore material for short-term pilot-scale testing of the feedstock with the goal
of ultimately establishing its rare earth element mineral reserves and resources for processing at a full-scale commercial processing
facility into rare earth element and critical mineral oxides. Contiguous to the Brook Mine, the
Company operates a carbon research facility related to the production of advanced carbon products and materials from coal. The
Company’s operations are organized into two reportable segments: Metallurgical Coal and Rare Earths and Critical Minerals. See
Note 12, “Segment Reporting,” for additional information.

Basis of Presentation
—These interim
financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC regarding interim financial
reporting. Certain disclosures have been condensed or omitted from these financial statements. Accordingly, they do not include all the
information and notes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for complete
consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.

In the opinion of the Company, the accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary
for a fair statement of the Company’s financial position as of September 30, 2025, as well as the results of operations
and cash flows for all periods presented. In preparing the accompanying financial statements, management has made certain estimates and
assumptions that affect reported amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures of contingencies. Actual
results may differ from those estimates. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of annual results. Intercompany
balances and transactions between consolidated entities have been eliminated.

There were no material changes to the
Company’s significant accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 other than the modification of its
reportable segment structure described in Note 12, “Segment Reporting”.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
—In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
 (“ASU 2023-09”).
The amendments in ASU 2023-09 require reporting entities to disclose annual income taxes paid, net of refunds, disaggregated by federal,
state, and foreign taxes and to provide additional disaggregated information for individual jurisdictions that equal or exceed 5% of
total income taxes paid, net of refunds. ASU 2023-09 also requires public business entities to disclose additional categories of information
about federal, state, and foreign income taxes in their annual rate reconciliation table and provide more information about some categories
if the quantitative threshold is met. The ASU will also require disclosure of amounts 
and
 percentages in the annual rate reconciliation
table, rather than amounts 
or
 percentages, and will eliminate certain existing disclosure requirements related to uncertain tax
positions and unrecognized deferred tax liabilities. ASU 2023-09 is effective starting with Ramaco’s 2025 annual financial statements
and may be applied prospectively to only the income tax disclosures provided for 2025 or retrospectively by providing revised disclosures
for all periods presented. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU; however, incremental
disclosures will be provided on a prospective basis in the Company’s 2025 annual financial statements upon adoption.

5

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03,

Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation
of Income Statement Expenses 
(“ASU 2024-03”). The amendments in ASU 2024-03 require public business entities to disclose
in the notes to the financial statements, among other things, specific information about certain costs and expenses including purchases
of inventory, employee compensation, and depreciation, amortization, and depletion expenses for each caption on the income statement
where such expenses are included. ASU 2024-03 is effective starting with the Company’s 2027 annual financial statements and on
a quarterly basis thereafter. Early adoption is permitted, and the amendments may be applied prospectively to reporting periods after
the effective date or retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the extent
to which its disclosures will be affected by the ASU.

Legislation
—On July 4, 2025, the
One Big Beautiful Bill Act was enacted in the United States. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes significant provisions, such as
the permanent extension of certain expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, modifications to the international tax framework
and the restoration of favorable tax treatment for certain business provisions. The legislation has multiple effective dates, with certain
provisions effective in 2025 and others implemented through future years. It also added metallurgical coal to the list of “critical
minerals” eligible for the section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit which significantly alters the tax landscape for metallurgical
coal. We expect the 
2.5
% tax credit to have a positive impact on the Company’s net income when it becomes effective in 2026, however,
we are currently assessing its impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Revolving Credit Facility—
On
May 3, 2024, the Company entered into the First Amendment Agreement (“First Amendment Agreement”) to the Second Amended and
Restated Credit and Security Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”), which includes KeyBank National Association (“KeyBank”)
and multiple lending parties, in order to, among other things, extend the maturity date and increase the size of the facility. The amended
facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) has a maturity date of 
May 3, 2029
, and provides an initial aggregate revolving
commitment of $
200.0
 million as well as an accordion feature to increase the size by an additional $
75.0
 million subject to certain terms
and conditions, including lenders’ consent. Prior to the First Amendment Agreement, the facility had a maturity date of February
15, 2026, and an initial aggregate revolving commitment of $
125.0
 million as well as an accordion feature of $
50.0
 million.

On
November 21, 2024, in order to facilitate the 2029 Note Offering described below, the Company entered into a Second Amendment
Agreement, which, among other things, amended the Credit Agreement by increasing the amount of “Permitted Additional Unsecured
Debt” (as defined in the Credit Agreement) from $
45,000,000
 to $
75,000,000
. On July 23, 2025, in order to facilitate the 2030
Note Offering described below, the Company entered into a Third Amendment Agreement, which, among other things, permitted the
Company to incur additional indebtedness in the form of unsecured notes to be issued in the 2030 Notes Offering in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed $
100.0
 million (the “2030 Unsecured Note Basket”), conditioned upon the full redemption
of the Company’s 2026 Notes issued in July 2021, and reduced the amount of “Permitted Additional Unsecured Debt”
from $
75.0
 million to $
15.0
 million plus the unused portion of the 2030 Unsecured Note Basket. On August 5, 2025, the Company
entered into a Fourth Amendment Agreement, which, among other things, amended the Credit Agreement by removing all negative
covenants relating to the issuance of equity securities by the Company.
 The borrowing base of the amended facility as of
September 30, 2025 was $
78.6
 million based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory collateral and reserve
requirements. There were no outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2025.

Revolving loans under the amended facility bear
interest at either the base rate plus 
2.0
% or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 
2.5
%. The base rate equals the highest of the
administrative agent’s prime rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 
0.5
%, or 
3.0
%. The effective interest rate for borrowings
during the third quarter of 2025 was 
6.83
%.

The terms of the Revolving Credit Facility include covenants limiting
the ability of the Company to incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans, incur liens, consummate mergers and similar fundamental
changes, make restricted payments, and enter into transactions with affiliates. The terms of the facility also require the Company to
maintain certain covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio and compensating balance requirements. A fixed charge coverage ratio
of not less than 
1.10
:
1.00
, calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, must be maintained by the Company. In addition, the
Company must maintain an average daily cash balance of $
5.0
 million, as determined on a monthly basis, in a dedicated account as well
as an additional $
1.5
 million and $
1.0
 million in separate dedicated accounts to assure future credit availability. At September 30, 2025,
the Company was in compliance with all debt covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.

8.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2030—
On
July 31, 2025, the Company completed a public offering of 
8.25
% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2030 (the “2030 Notes”) having
an aggregate principal amount of $
57.0
 million with an option for the underwriters to purchase an additional $
8
 million of aggregate
principal which was exercised by the underwriters on August 1, 2025 (the “2030 Note Offering”). The 2030 Notes mature on

July 31, 2030
, unless redeemed prior to maturity and bear interest at a rate of 
8.25
% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on the
30th day of January, April, July and October of each year, commencing on October 30, 2025. The Company may redeem the 2030 Notes in whole
or in part, at the Company’s option, at any time on or after July 31, 2027, or upon certain change of control events, at a redemption
price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption. The Notes
were listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (the “NASDAQ”) on August 1, 2025 under the symbol “METCI.”

7

The net proceeds from the 2030 Note Offering
were used to redeem in full all outstanding amounts under the Senior Notes due in 2026, with remaining proceeds to be used for
general corporate purposes, including funding future investments, making capital expenditures and funding working capital. The
remaining $
34.5
 million in aggregate principal of Senior Notes due in 2026 was repaid on July 31, 2025.

8.375% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2029
—On November 27,
2024, the Company completed an offering of $
50.0
 million, in the aggregate, of 
8.375
% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2029 (the “2029
Notes”) and on December 11, 2024, the Company closed on an additional $
7.5
 million of aggregate principal amount of 2029 Notes (the
“2029 Note Offering”). The Company incurred transaction-related fees of $
2.3
 million and third-party debt issuance costs of
$
0.8
 million. The 2029 Notes mature on November 30, 2029, unless redeemed prior to maturity. The 2029 Notes bear interest at a rate of

8.375
% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on the 30th day of January, April, July and October of each year, commencing on January
30, 2025. The Company may redeem the 2029 Notes in whole or in part, at the Company’s option, at any time on or after
November 30, 2026, at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including,
the date of redemption. The Notes were listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol “METCZ.”

Fair Value
—The Company’s
2029 Notes had an estimated fair value of $
58.7
 million and $
58.1
 million at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
The Company’s 2030 Notes, which were issued on July 31, 2025, had an estimated fair value of $
66.6
 million at September 30,
2025. The Company’s Senior Notes due in 2026, which were repaid on July 31, 2025, had an estimated fair value of $
35.6
 million
at December 31, 2024. The fair values of the Company’s Senior Notes were based on observable market prices and were considered
a Level 2 measurement based on trading volumes. The difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the Company’s
remaining debts is not material due to the similarity between the terms of the debt agreements and prevailing market terms available
to the Company.

Current Portion of Long-term Debt—The Company’s
short-term debt at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 comprised of $
0.1
 million and $
0.4
 million due under equipment loans with
a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
4.7
% for each period.

Other—
Lease obligations and liabilities
related to insurance premium financing are excluded from the disclosures above.

Self-Insurance
—The Company is self-insured
for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation claims and occupational disease obligations under the Federal Mine Safety
and Health Act of 1969, as amended, as well as for employee medical expenses. The Company purchases insurance coverage to reduce its
exposure to significant levels of these claims. Self-insured losses are accrued based upon estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured
claims incurred as of the balance sheet date using claims data and actuarial assumptions and, therefore, are subject to uncertainty due
to a variety of factors.

The estimated aggregate liability for these items
totaled $
8.6
 million and $
8.3
 million as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Of the aggregate liability, the amounts
included in Other long-term liabilities were $
6.3
 million and $
5.2
 million at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.

Funds held in escrow for potential future workers’
compensation claims are considered restricted cash and have been included in prepaid expenses and other on the condensed consolidated
balance sheets. Restricted cash balances were $
0.8
 million at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

NOTE 7—EQUITY

Common Stock—
On June 12, 2023, an
amendment to the Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation was approved by shareholder vote to reclassify the
Company’s existing common stock as shares of Class A common stock and create a separate Class B common stock.

The initial distribution of Class B common stock
occurred on June 21, 2023 via a stock dividend to existing holders of common stock as of May 12, 2023. On the date of initial distribution,
each holder of common stock received 
0.2
 shares of Class B common stock for every 
one
 share of existing common stock held on the record
date. Similar actions or modifications occurred for holders of outstanding stock-based awards.

8

The distribution of the Class B common stock
provides existing holders of the Company’s common stock with an opportunity to participate directly in the financial performance
of the Company’s CORE assets on a stand-alone basis, separate from the Company’s metallurgical coal operations. CORE assets
were acquired initially as part of the Company’s acquisition of Ramaco Coal in the second quarter of 2022. The financial performance
of CORE assets consists of the following non-cost bearing revenue streams based on the Company’s current expectations:

●
Royalty fees derived from the royalties associated with the
Ramaco Coal and Amonate reserves, which we believe approximates 
3
% of Company-produced coal sales revenue excluding coal sales revenue
from Knox Creek,

●
Infrastructure fees based on $
5.00
 per ton of coal processed
at our preparation plants and $
2.50
 per ton of loaded coal at the Company’s rail load-out facilities, and

●
Future income derived, if and when realized, from advanced
carbon products as well as rare earth elements and critical minerals initiatives.

The Company has paid dividends equal to 
20
% of
the total fees above; however, any dividend amounts declared and paid are subject to the sole discretion of the Company’s Board
of Directors.

In addition, the Board of Directors retains the
power to change or add expense allocation policies related to CORE, redefine CORE assets, and redetermine CORE’s per-ton usage
fees at any time, in its sole discretion, without shareholder approval. Holders of shares of Class A common stock continue to be entitled
to receive dividends when and if declared by the Board of Directors subject to any statutory or contractual restrictions on the payment
of dividends and to any prior rights and preferences that may be applicable to outstanding preferred stock, if any.

CORE is not a separate legal entity, and holders
of Class B common stock do not own a direct interest in the assets of CORE. Holders of Class B common stock are stockholders of Ramaco
Resources, Inc. and are subject to all risks and liabilities of the Company as a whole.

With respect to voting rights, holders of Class
A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders and are
entitled to 
one
 vote per share. The holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in
the election of directors. Class B common stock does not have any specific voting rights or governance rights with respect to CORE.

With respect to liquidation rights, holders of
common stock are entitled to receive ratably the assets available for distribution to the stockholders after payment of liabilities and
the liquidation preference of outstanding preferred stock, if any. That is, the rights to residual net assets upon liquidation are equal
between holders of Class A and Class B common stock. Holders of Class B common stock do not have specific rights to CORE assets in the
event of liquidation.

The Board of Directors also retains the ability,
in its sole discretion, to exchange all outstanding shares of Class B common stock into Class A common stock based on an exchange ratio
determined by a 
20
-day trailing volume-weighted average price for each class of stock.

Class A Common Stock
Issuance
—On August 7, 2025, the Company completed an underwritten public offering, with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC as underwriters, relating to the issuance of 
10,666,667
 shares of the Company’s Class A common
stock at a price to the public of $
18.75
 per share (the “August Offering”). The Underwriters purchased the shares of
common stock at a price of $
17.71875
 per share. The net proceeds to the Company from the August Offering were approximately $
188.1

million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The
Company intends to use the net proceeds from the August Offering to fund the acceleration of our development of our rare earth
elements and critical minerals project, for strategic growth opportunities, and for general corporate purposes.

Stock-Based Awards
—Stock-based compensation
expense totaled $
4.7
 million and $
4.0
 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024, respectively. Stock-based
compensation expense totaled $
12.8
 million and $
13.3
 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024, respectively.
During 2024, the Company granted new stock-based awards and modified certain awards previously granted as discussed below. New stock-based
awards granted during the first nine months of 2025 were for Class A common stock, all of which were granted in the first quarter of
2025. There were 
no
 Class B stock-based awards granted during the first nine months of 2025.

Restricted Stock—
We granted 
341,295

shares of Class A restricted stock to certain senior executives, key employees, and directors during the first quarter of 2025, having
a grant-date fair value of $
3.3
 million. The aggregate fair value of the awards granted to employees was $
2.7
 million, which is recognized
ratably as expense over the 
three-year
 service period unless forfeited. The aggregate fair value of restricted stock granted to directors
was $
0.6
 million, which is recognized ratably as expense over 
one year
 unless forfeited. During the vesting period, the participants
have voting rights and receive nonforfeitable dividends on the same basis as fully vested common stockholders.

Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)—
We
granted 
713,305
 Class A restricted stock units to certain senior executives and key employees during the first quarter of 2025, having
a grant-date fair value of $
9.81
 per share. The aggregate fair value of these awards was $
7.0
 million, which is recognized ratably as
expense over the 
three-year
 service period unless forfeited. During the vesting period, the participants have 
no
 voting rights and no
dividend rights; however, participants are entitled to receive dividend equivalents, which shall be subject to the same conditions applicable
to the units and payable at the time the units vest. The recipient will receive 
one
 share of Class A common stock for each stock unit
vested.

Performance Stock Units (“PSUs”)—
We
granted Class A performance stock units to certain senior executives and key employees during the first quarter of 2025. These awards
cliff-vest approximately three years from the date of grant based on the achievement of targeted performance levels related to pre-established
relative total shareholder return goals. These performance stock units may be earned from 
0
% to 
200
% of target depending on actual results.
During the vesting period, the participants have 
no
 voting rights and no dividend rights; however, participants are entitled to
receive dividend equivalents, which shall be subject to the same conditions applicable to the units and payable at the time the units
vest. The recipient will receive 
one
 share of Class A common stock for each stock unit vested.

Performance stock units are accounted for as awards
with a market condition since vesting depends on total shareholder return relative to a group of peer companies. The target number of
performance stock units granted during the first quarter of 2025, or 
713,305
 units, were valued relative to the total shareholder return
of a peer group based on a Monte Carlo simulation, which resulted in a grant date fair value of $
15.03
 per unit. The aggregate fair value
of these awards was $
10.7
 million, which is recognized ratably as expense over the 
three-year
 period.

Modification—
 The resignation of
one of the Company’s executive officers and the separation agreement between the employee and the Company that occurred during
the first quarter of 2024 resulted in a net charge to stock compensation expense of $
1.2
 million during the period. Incremental value
of $
1.8
 million resulted from the continued equity vesting provision included in the separation agreement applicable to the employee’s
restricted stock awards, which was recognized as an expense. This amount was offset partially by the $
0.6
 million reversal of previously
recognized compensation expense related to the pre-modified restricted stock award ($
0.3
 million) as well as the forfeiture of restricted
stock units and performance stock units (collectively $
0.3
 million).

NOTE 8—COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Environmental Liabilities
—
Environmental
liabilities are recognized when the expenditures are considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Measurement of liabilities
is based on currently enacted laws and regulations, existing technology, and undiscounted site-specific costs. Generally, such recognition
would coincide with a commitment to a formal plan of action. 
No
 amounts have been recognized for environmental liabilities.

Surety Bond
—
In accordance
with state laws, we are required to post reclamation bonds to assure that reclamation work is completed. We also have a smaller amount
of surety bonds that secure performance obligations. Bonds outstanding at September 30, 2025 totaled approximately $
34.7
 million.

Coal Leases and Associated Royalty Commitments
—We
lease coal reserves under agreements that require royalties to be paid as the coal is mined and sold. Many of these agreements require
minimum annual royalties to be paid regardless of the amount of coal mined and sold. Total royalty expenses were $
4.5
 million and $
6.4

million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024, and $
17.3
 million and $
19.5
 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024, respectively. These agreements generally have terms running through exhaustion of all
the mineable and merchantable coal covered by the respective lease. Royalties or throughput payments are based on a percentage of the
gross selling price received for the coal we mine.

Contingent Transportation Purchase Commitments—
We
secure the ability to transport coal through rail contracts and export terminals that are sometimes funded through take-or-pay arrangements.
As of September 30, 2025, the Company’s remaining commitments under take-or-pay arrangements totaled $
23.4
 million, the majority
of which relates to 
two
 multi-year contracts with total remaining commitments of $
11.3
 million and $
11.8
 million until the terms expire
in the fourth quarter of 2026 and the first quarter of 2028, respectively. The level of these commitments will generally be reduced at
a per ton rate as such rail and export terminal services are utilized against the required minimum tonnage amounts over the contract
term stipulated in such rail and export terminal contracts. However, as of September 30, 2025, the Company had 
no
 expected volume shortfall
resulting in a need for an accrued liability.

11

Litigation
—From time to time, we
are subject to various litigation and other claims in the normal course of business. Losses related to such contingencies are accrued
when/if loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. 
No
 losses have been accrued in the consolidated financial
statements with respect to such matters. Losses from certain injury-related matters are reasonably possible of occurring; however, an
estimate of the possible range of loss cannot be made at this time as no litigation has progressed sufficiently through discovery and
development of important facts and legal issues at this time. While it is possible that liability will be assessed against us in the
preparation plant purchase matter discussed below, we deem that possibility to be remote.

Preparation Plant Purchase

In February 2024, we purchased a Preparation Plant
(the “Plant”) from EMCOAL, Inc. for $
3
 million. After this purchase, the Plant was disassembled and transported to the Maben
Complex for reassembly. On November 15, 2024, Justice Coal of Alabama, LLC (the “Plaintiff”) filed a complaint in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia, Beckley Division, against Ramaco Resources, Inc., Ramaco Development,
LLC, and Maben Coal LLC. On May 5, 2025, the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia granted our Motion
to Transfer Venue to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. On June 3, 2025 Plaintiff amended its Complaint
to add EMCOAL, Inc. as a Defendant.

Plaintiff claims their sale of the Plant to EMCOAL,
Inc. was not completed and thus EMCOAL, Inc. did not have the right to sell the Plant to us. As a result of Ramaco purchasing the Plant
from EMCOAL, Inc., Plaintiff claims in the complaint we are liable for conversion, unjust enrichment, and negligence. Plaintiff has sought
damages for these alleged claims. We filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint against us on June 24, 2025 and that
motion is currently pending before the Court. We believe we have meritorious defenses to all claims in this matter.

Storage Silo Partial Failure

On November 5, 2018, 
one
 of our 
three
 raw
coal storage silos that fed our Elk Creek plant experienced a partial structural failure. A temporary conveying system completed in late-November
2018 restored approximately 
80
% of our plant capacity. We completed a permanent belt workaround and restored the preparation plant
to its full processing capacity in mid-2019. Our insurance carrier, Federal Insurance Company, disputed our claim for coverage based
on certain exclusions to the applicable policy and, therefore, on August 21, 2019, we filed suit against Federal Insurance Company and
Chubb INA Holdings, Inc. in Logan County Circuit Court in West Virginia seeking a declaratory judgment that the partial silo collapse
was an insurable event and to require coverage under our policy. Defendants removed the case to the United States District Court for
the Southern District of West Virginia, and upon removal, we substituted ACE American Insurance Company as a defendant in place of Chubb
INA Holdings, Inc. The trial in the matter commenced on June 29, 2021, in Charleston, West Virginia.

On July 15, 2021, the jury returned a verdict
in our favor for $
7.7
 million in contract damages and on July 16, 2021, made an additional award of $
25.0
 million for damages
for wrongful denial of the claim under 
Hayseeds, Inc.

v. State Farm Fire & Cas.
, 177 W. Va. 323, 352 S.E.
2d 73 (W. Va. 1986), including inconvenience and aggravation. On August 12, 2021, the defendants filed a post-trial motion for judgment
as a matter of law or in the alternative to alter or amend the judgment or for a new trial. On March 4, 2022, the court entered its memorandum
opinion and order on the motion reducing the jury award to a total of $
1.8
 million, including pre-judgment interest, and also vacated
and set aside, in its entirety, the jury award of 
Hayseeds
 damages. The same day, the court entered the judgment in
accordance with the memorandum opinion and order.

On April 1, 2022, we filed a notice of appeal
with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. On July 20, 2023, the court rendered a decision reinstating the jury’s $
7.7
 million
contract damages verdict. The court further determined that we are entitled to attorney’s fees in an amount to be determined on
remand. Finally, the court held that we are entitled to 
Hayseeds
 damages for wrongful denial of the claim but remanded
for a new trial on the amount of such damages after affirming that the original $
25
 million award was excessive. On August 3, 2023,
the Defendants-Appellees filed a Petition of Rehearing and Rehearing 
En Banc
 with the Fourth Circuit. The petition was
denied by order dated August 15, 2023. On August 29, 2023, the court clarified that the amount of attorney’s fees to be determined
on remand included appellate fees. On September 8, 2023, the court entered its amended judgment, which awarded post-judgment interest
on the previously awarded and reinstated verdict related to contract (compensatory) damages and the Fourth Circuit thereafter issued
its mandate on October 2, 2023. On August 19, 2024, the Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order that the Hayseeds damages to be considered
in the new trial would include annoyance and inconvenience up to October 2, 2023 with new discovery permitted for the time period of
July 15, 2021 through October 2, 2023. The Court also ordered Hayseeds damages to be considered for net economic loss caused by the defendant’s
delay in settlement be allowed for the time period of July 15, 2021 through October 2, 2023 with new discovery to be permitted for that
time period.

12

The defendants fully paid the portion of the
judgment related to contract (compensatory) damages in the court’s order and that portion of the matter is considered closed.
The Company recognized a $
7.8
 million gain during 2023, which was recorded in 
Other income (expense), net
 on
the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Of this amount, $
2.0
 million was included in 
Insurance proceeds related to
property, plant, and equipment
 as part of investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and the
remaining amount was included in operating activities. On April 24, 2024, the Court stated Ramaco is entitled to reasonable attorney
fees for both the appeal and the first trial, adding there will be a full 
Hayseeds
 trial under the timelines set
forth above. Regarding the court’s determination and award of attorney’s fees, the Company accrued an additional loss
recovery asset of less than $
0.1
 million during the third quarter of 2025, bringing the total loss recovery asset to approximately
$
4.7
 million in 
Prepaid expenses and other
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2025. The
corresponding reduction of less than $
0.1
 million during the third quarter of 2025 was to 
Selling, general, and
administrative
 expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company considers that it is probable to recover
at least this amount of previously recognized attorneys’ fees expenses based upon the developments above.

The matter is now pending before the District
Court for a new trial for 
Hayseeds
 damages, as well as the court’s determination and award of attorney’s fees.
The trial date originally set for July 15, 2025 has been continued and we are currently awaiting a new scheduling order from the court.

NOTE 9—REVENUE

Our revenue is derived from contracts for the
sale of coal and is recognized when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied, which is at the point in time control
is transferred to our customer. Generally, domestic sales contracts have terms of about 
one year
 and the pricing is typically fixed.
Export sales have spot or term contracts, and pricing can be either fixed or derived against index-based pricing mechanisms. Sales completed
with delivery to an export terminal are reported as export revenue.

Revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025
includes a $
0.1
 and $
0.6
 million, respectively, net increase to revenue related to adjustments for performance obligations satisfied
in a previous reporting period. These adjustments were due to true-ups of previous estimates for provisional pricing and demurrage as
well as price adjustments for minimum specifications or qualities of delivered coal.

As of September 30, 2025, the Company
had outstanding performance obligations of approximately 
0.6
 million tons for contracts with fixed sales prices averaging $
164

per ton, excluding freight, as well as 
1.2
 million tons for contracts with index-based pricing mechanisms. The Company expects to satisfy
approximately 
48
% of the committed tons in 2025, 
48
% in 2026, and 
3
% in 2027. Variable amounts, including index-based prices, have not
been estimated for the purpose of disclosing remaining performance obligations as permitted under the revenue recognition guidance when
variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation.

The Company has not recorded any revenues from
the Rare Earths and Critical Minerals Segment.

Concentrations
—During the three months
ended September 30, 2025, sales to 
three
 individual customers were 10% or more of our total revenue. Sales to these customers represented

15
%, 
10
%, and 
11
%, respectively, or collectively 
36
%, of our total revenue during the three-month period. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2025, sales to two individual customers were 10% or more of our total revenue. Sales to these customers represented 
16
%
and 
11
%, respectively, or collectively 
27
%, of our total revenue during the nine month period. For comparison purposes, the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales to two individual customers were 10% or more of our total revenue and collectively accounted
for approximately 
22
% and 
23
%, respectively, of our total revenue. Three customers with individual accounts receivable balances equal
to 10% or more of total accounts receivable made up approximately 
24
%, 
14
%, and 
12
% of our trade receivables, or collectively 
50
% of the
Company’s accounts receivable balance at September 30, 2025.

NOTE 10—INCOME TAXES

Income tax provisions for interim periods are
generally based on an estimated annual effective income tax rate calculated separately from the effect of significant, infrequent, or
unusual items related specifically to interim periods. The income tax impacts of discrete items are recognized in the period these occur.

Our effective tax rate for the three months ended
September 30, 2025 and 2024 was 
19.9
% benefit and 
9.3
% expense, respectively, excluding the impact of discrete items. Our effective tax
rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was 
22.2
% benefit and 
28.0
% expense, respectively, excluding discrete items.
Discrete items for the periods included items for management compensation and stock-based compensation.

Unvested restricted stock awards have the right
to receive nonforfeitable dividends on the same basis as common shares; therefore, unvested restricted stock is considered a participating
security to calculate EPS. Under the two-class method, the Company reports separately the net earnings allocated away from holders of
Class A and Class B common stock to holders of unvested restricted stock awards.

For accounting purposes, Class B’s participation
rights in net earnings are, in substance, discretionary based on the power of the Company’s Board of Directors to add or modify
expense allocation policies, redefine CORE assets, and redetermine CORE’s per-ton usage fees at any time, in its sole discretion,
without shareholder approval. Therefore, no amount of the Company’s net earnings shall be allocated to Class B to calculate EPS
other than actual dividends declared during the period for the tracking stock. However, during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2025, dividends declared by the Company were more than consolidated net income (loss) for the period, which resulted in an undistributed
net loss for reporting purposes. The resulting undistributed net loss was allocated proportionately between outstanding Class A and Class
B common stock based on the rights to residual net assets upon liquidation being equal between holders of Class A and Class B common
stock. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, two dividends were declared for Class A common stock and three dividends were declared
for Class B common stock.

Diluted EPS is calculated using the treasury
stock method for stock options and restricted stock units. For performance stock units, the awards are first evaluated under the contingently
issuable shares guidance, which requires a determination as to whether shares would be issuable if the end of the reporting period were
the end of the contingency period. For shares determined to be issuable under performance stock unit awards, the treasury stock method
is then applied to determine the dilutive impact of the awards, if any. Unvested restricted stock awards are considered potential common
shares as well as participating securities, as discussed previously, and are included in diluted EPS using the more dilutive of the treasury
stock method or the two-class method. Since these awards share in dividends on a 
1
:1 basis with common shares, applying the treasury
stock method is antidilutive compared to the basic EPS calculation that allocates earnings to participating securities under the two-class
method discussed previously.

Antidilutive shares excluded from the dilutive
EPS calculation are presented below:

NOTE 12—SEGMENT REPORTING

Pursuant to ASC 280, operating segments are defined
as components of an enterprise engaged in business activities from which it may recognize revenues and incur expenses, about which discrete
financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in deciding how
to allocate resources and in assessing performance.

During the third quarter of 2025, the Company modified its segment
structure largely as a result of activity at the Brook Mine during the period. Beginning with the third quarter of 2025, the Company’s
reportable segments, which are primarily based on the Company’s internal organizational structure and types of controlled mineral
deposits, are its 
two
 operating segments—Metallurgical Coal and Rare Earths and Critical Minerals (no operating segments have been
aggregated). The change in reportable segments also resulted in a change to the CODM’s primary segment measure of profit or loss
in assessing segment performance as further described below. In conjunction with this change, prior period amounts have been recast to
conform to this new segment reporting structure.

The Metallurgical Coal segment operates and develops
high-quality, low-cost metallurgical coal in southern West Virginia and southwestern Virginia. The Metallurgical Coal segment generates
revenue primarily through the production of metallurgical coal for sale to the steel industry. The Metallurgical Coal segment also generates
revenue through the sale of coal purchased from third parties.

The Rare Earths and Critical Minerals
segment operates the Brook Mine complex located in Sheridan, Wyoming, where the Company is developing rare earth elements and
critical mineral operations in addition to performing initiatives related to coal-to-carbon based products and materials. The Brook
Mine has initially begun to produce representative ore material for short-term pilot-scale testing of the feedstock with the goal of
ultimately establishing its rare earth element mineral reserves and resources for processing at a full-scale commercial processing
facility into rare earth element and critical mineral oxides. No revenues have been recognized from the Rare Earths and Critical
Minerals segment.

15

The Company’s CODM, the 
chief executive officer
, regularly reviews
financial information at the segment level for the purpose of allocating resources and assessing operating results and financial performance.

The CODM uses Segment Adjusted EBITDA as management’s primary segment measure of profit or loss in assessing segment performance
and deciding how to allocate the Company’s resources. This measure enables the CODM to evaluate operational efficiency and segment
performance by comparing current results to historical data, while also monitoring variances between actual results and forecasts to inform
decisions on capital, personnel and other resource allocations across segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as segment revenues
less significant segment expenses, specifically, cost of sales (excluding transportation costs), transportation costs and selling, general
and administrative expenses (excluding stock-based compensation expense), as well as certain other segment items. Significant segment
expenses and other segment items also exclude certain costs that are non-recurring, non-cash or are not related to the segments’
underlying business performance. A reconciliation of total Segment Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated income or loss before income taxes
is included in the tables below.

Certain current period costs are incurred at the corporate level and
are allocated to the Company’s segments. These costs generally include shared service functions such as legal, information technology,
finance and accounting, sales, and executive management. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances
of the costs being allocated that is deemed to best represent the expected benefit received by the operating segment. The remaining unallocated
corporate costs that are not attributed to the operating segments are reported within Corporate expenses as a reconciling item to our
consolidated results. Our allocation methodology is periodically evaluated and may change. A similar allocation of shared service functions
is not presented within the recasted prior period information as the benefit to the respective operating segment is not comparable to
the current period. The expenses associated with these shared service functions are presented within the Metallurgical Coal segment in
the prior period.

As the Company’s CODM manages the Company’s
assets on a consolidated basis, the CODM is not regularly provided asset information for the reportable segments. The Company does not
have any material long-lived assets located outside of the United States. For all of the periods presented below, (i) the Company’s
revenues were derived from U.S.-domiciled operations, and (ii) the Company did not have any intersegment revenues.

The CODM does not regularly review segment asset
information at a different asset level or category than those disclosed within the consolidated balance sheet for the purpose of assessing
performance and making resource allocation decisions.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis of our
financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in our Annual Report, as well as the financial statements and related
notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future
plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. The forward-looking statements are dependent upon events, risks and uncertainties
that may be outside our control. We caution you that our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking
statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, particularly
in the “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and in our Annual Report and in this Quarterly Report
under the heading “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” all of which are difficult to predict. In light of these risks, uncertainties
and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed may not occur. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking
statements except as otherwise required by applicable law.

Overview

We are an operator and developer of high-quality,
low-cost metallurgical coal in southern West Virginia and southwestern Virginia. Our metallurgical coal development portfolio primarily
includes the following properties: Elk Creek, Berwind, Knox Creek, and Maben. We believe each of these properties possesses geologic and
logistical advantages that make our coal among the lowest delivered-cost U.S. metallurgical coal to our domestic customer base, North
American blast furnace steel mills and coke plants, as well as international metallurgical coal consumers. In June 2025, we initiated development of our rare earth element and critical mineral operations near Sheridan, Wyoming (the “Brook
Mine”). That mine has initially begun to produce representative ore material for short-term pilot-scale testing of the feedstock
with the goal of ultimately establishing its rare earth element mineral reserves and resources for processing at a full-scale commercial
processing facility into rare earth element and critical mineral oxides. Contiguous to the Brook Mine, the
Company operates a carbon research facility related to the production of advanced carbon products and materials from coal.

Our reportable segments, which are primarily
based on the Company’s internal organizational structure and types of controlled mineral deposits, are its two operating segments—Metallurgical
Coal and Rare Earths and Critical Minerals. Where applicable, prior period amounts have been recast to conform to this segment reporting
structure, which was modified during the third quarter of 2025.

Metallurgical Coal Segment

Our primary source of revenue is the sale of
metallurgical coal. We maintain 66 million reserve tons and 1,352 million measured and indicated resource tons of high-quality metallurgical
coal. Our plan is to continue the development of our existing properties and grow annual production over the next few years to approximately
seven million clean tons of metallurgical coal, subject to market conditions, permitting and additional capital deployment in the medium-term.
We may make acquisitions of reserves or infrastructure that continue our focus on advantaged geology and lower costs.

The overall outlook of the metallurgical coal
business is dependent on a variety of factors such as pricing, regulatory uncertainties, and global economic conditions. Coal consumption
and production in the U.S. are driven by several market dynamics and trends including the U.S. and global economies, the U.S. dollar’s
strength relative to other currencies and accelerating production cuts. Blast furnace steelmaking is more prevalent outside the U.S.
compared to domestic steel production, which creates demand for exports of metallurgical coal, including demand growth in Asia Pacific.

Global metallurgical coal markets softened in
2024 and continued to do so in 2025 due to constrained economic growth in some regions of the world and continued conflict overseas.
The global steel market experienced slower growth, especially in China, resulting in elevated levels of Chinese steel exports. These
conditions have led steel companies to both cut back on their own production and to reduce the price they are willing to pay for their
metallurgical coal feedstock. For 2025, overall steel demand will likely remain weak in the near term; however, supply cuts may occur
for higher cost operations absent a significant upward movement in pricing. Longer term, the Company believes that limited global investment
in new coking coal production capacity, the industrialization of emerging economies, expansion of urbanization globally, and an eventual
return to economic growth will support coking coal markets overall.

21

During the nine months ended September 30, 2025,
we sold 2.9 million tons of coal and recognized $408.6 million of revenue. Of this amount, 38% of our revenue was from sales into North
American markets, including Canada, and 62% of our revenue was from sales into export markets. During the same period of 2024, we sold
2.9 million tons of coal and recognized $495.4 million of revenue, of which 33% was from sales into North American markets, including
Canada, and 67% was from sales into export markets. Sales into export markets, which often include index-based pricing, generally have
greater exposure to variability in pricing from period to period. The Company’s exports have not been materially delayed or otherwise
affected by recent severe weather events, dockworker labor disputes, or recently enacted U.S. tariffs.

As of September 30, 2025, the Company
had outstanding performance obligations of approximately 0.6 million tons for contracts with fixed sales prices averaging $164
per ton, excluding freight, as well as 1.2 million tons for contracts with index-based pricing mechanisms. The Company expects to satisfy
approximately 48% of the committed tons in 2025, 48% in 2026, and 3% in 2027. Refer to Note 9 of Part I, Item 1 for additional information.

The metallurgical coal markets are volatile in
nature; therefore, the Company prioritizes managing its financial position and liquidity, while managing costs and capital expenditures
and returning value to its shareholders.

In the first nine months of 2025, our segment capital expenditures
were $45.9 million, excluding capitalized interest of $0.9 million. In the first nine months of 2024, our capital expenditures were $55.8
million, excluding capitalized interest of $1.0 million. The decrease in capital expenditures was due to lower spending in 2025 on the
Company’s strategic growth projects, specifically at the Maben preparation plant.

The Company produced 2.9 million tons during the first nine months
of 2025 compared to 2.7 million tons during the first nine months of 2024 as a result of the increase in capacity and completed development
work. The Company expects full-year production volumes in 2025 between 3.7 and 3.9 million tons with an ability to vary production dependent
on market conditions.

Rare Earths and Critical Minerals Segment

The Company continues to make significant progress
on the development of the Brook Mine rare earth elements and critical mineral project. Analyses performed to date indicate elevated levels
of rare earth elements along with significant concentrations of critical minerals which were banned for export to the United States by
China. In March 2025, the Company received a $6.1 million matching grant from the Wyoming Energy Authority, which shall be applied toward
the development of an initial processing laboratory/pilot plant and related facilities at the Brook Mine. Construction of the laboratory/pilot
plant began in Q3 2025 and is expected to be completed in mid-2026. Concurrently, in conjunction with Fluor Corporation, the Company has
completed its preliminary economic assessment that demonstrates the viability of commercial development of rare earth elements and critical
minerals processing. A summary of these findings was released in July 2025.

Earlier in 2025, President Trump issued an
emergency declaration which prioritizes domestic critical mineral production as a matter of national security and economic
resilience. As a result, the Company has been actively engaged in strategic discussions involving senior officials across the
Department of Energy, Department of Interior, Department of War, the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council, the
President’s National Energy Dominance Council, and the National Security Council in response to the shared urgency to reduce
reliance on foreign sources of critical mineral production and processing. The Company was requested by various arms of the
Administration to consider both the expansion and acceleration of the Brook Mine project. In September 2025, the Company expanded
its internal production projections from the preliminary economic assessment and released a Technical Report Summary, prepared by
Weir International, Inc., reflecting enhanced project economics and resource efficiency stemming from higher grade resource quality
than previously known at the time of the preliminary economic assessment.

In August 2025, concurrent with the rapid evolution
of the Brook Mine project, the Company successfully raised gross proceeds of $200 million through an underwritten public offering of its
Class A common stock, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses payable by the Company.
This additional capital provides a significant funding source towards the development of our rare earth elements and critical minerals
platform at the Brook Mine.

22

We have also made notable additions to our executive
management team in 2025 to lead in the development of the Rare Earths and Critical Minerals segment as we continue to refine mineral recovery,
extraction methodology, and processing capacity assumptions within the mine plan. To assist in the continued development of the project,
the Company has officially retained Hatch Ltd. to lead its ongoing pre-feasibility study. Hatch was selected for its technical expertise
in rare earth element processing and will oversee test work, laboratory/pilot plant design, and process optimization. This pre-feasibility
study is expected to provide key information for future permitting, investment, and offtake discussions aligning with the Company’s
strategy to accelerate project development. The pre-feasibility study is expected to be completed in 2026. We expect to proceed to engineering and designing the full commercial oxide plant, with a construction period to be validated and updated
upon the completion of the pre-feasibility study to be followed by a subsequent two-year shakedown period for the plant to be optimized
to reach full steady-state capacity.

In the first nine months of 2025, our segment
capital expenditures were $2.4 million compared to $0.1 million for the corresponding time period of 2024. The increase in capital expenditures
was attributable to the continued expansion of the Brook Mine project.

No revenues have been recognized from the Company’s
Rare Earths and Critical Minerals segment to date.

The activities at the Brook Mine may result in
a material change to our operating results and financial condition in future periods as the project continues to develop. The future financial
statement impact is largely dependent on the results of laboratory/pilot plant testing for processing rare earth element and critical
mineral concentrates into oxides and subsequent achievement of commercial production. At this time, we are unable to estimate the potential financial impact to future periods.

Net income and Adjusted EBITDA for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2025 were negatively impacted by the softening of global metallurgical coal markets and
the decrease in metallurgical coal price indices. This occurred due to a variety of macroeconomic factors, including the continued Chinese
oversupply of steel into a muted global economic environment. Refer to 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
 later in Item 2 for more information
regarding Adjusted EBITDA.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared
to Three Months Ended September 30, 2024

Revenue.
 Coal sales revenue for the three
months ended September 30, 2025 was $121.0 million, approximately 28% lower than the same period in 2024 driven by the negative impact
of pricing and a 15% decrease in tons sold. See the “Metallurgical Coal Segment” section below for further discussion of year-over-year
changes in revenue. There are no revenues from rare earth elements and critical minerals at this time.

Cost of sales. 
Our cost of coal sales for
the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $101.8 million, approximately 24% lower than the same period in 2024 driven by the closure
of the Jawbone mine in Q3 2024 and the idling of the Rockhouse Eagle mine in Q2 2025, in addition to reduced trucking costs at the Maben
complex subsequent to commissioning in Q4 2024. See the “Metallurgical Coal Segment” section below for further discussion
of year-over-year changes in cost of sales. There are no cost of sales from rare earth elements and critical minerals at this time.

Depreciation, depletion, and amortization.

Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense totaled $17.1 million
and $17.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The decrease quarter-to-quarter was related to
a $1.4 million decrease in development amortization, partially offset by general increases in plant and equipment versus 2024.

Selling, general, and administrative. 
Selling,
general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $16.1 million and $12.9 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2025 and 2024 respectively. The $3.2 million increase in 2025 was primarily due to an increase in professional service
expenses.

Other income (expense), net. 
Other
income (expense), net was consistent for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended September 30,
2024, with $0.1 million in other income and ($0.1) million in other expense, respectively.

Interest expense, net. 
Interest expense, net was $2.3 million for the three months ended September
30, 2025 compared to $1.7 million for the same period in 2024. The increase in 2025 was largely due to issuance of the 8.375% Senior Unsecured
Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”)  in late 2024.

Income tax expense (benefit).
 The effective
tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was 19.9% and 9.3%, respectively, excluding the impact of discrete items.
Discrete items for the periods included items for management compensation and stock-based compensation. The primary differences from the
federal statutory rate of 21% are related to state taxes, non-deductible expenses, the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, and
depletion expense for income tax purposes.

Earnings (loss) per share.

11 of Part I, Item 1 for information regarding earnings per share calculations for Class A and Class B common stock.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared
to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024

Revenue. 
Coal sales revenue for the nine
months ended September 30, 2025 was $408.6 million, approximately 18% lower than the same period in 2024 driven by the negative impact
of pricing. See the “Metallurgical Coal Segment” section below for further discussion of year-over-year changes in revenue.
There are no revenues from rare earth elements and critical minerals at this time.

Cost of sales. 
Our cost of coal sales totaled
$346.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $397.2 million for the same period in 2024. The 13% decrease was
driven by the closure of the Jawbone mine in Q3 2024 and the idling of the Rockhouse Eagle mine in Q2 2025, in addition to reduced trucking
costs at the Maben complex subsequent to commissioning in Q4 2024. See the “Metallurgical Coal Segment” section below for
further discussion of year-over-year changes in cost of sales. There are no cost of sales from rare earth elements and critical minerals
at this time.

24

Depreciation, depletion, and amortization.

Depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense totaled $51.7 million
and $48.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 respectively. The increase year-to-year was related to general
increases in plant and equipment and production versus 2024.

Selling, general, and administrative.

SG&A expenses were $49.8 million and $37.9 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase in 2025 was primarily due to an increase in professional service
expenses.

Other income (expense), net.
 Other income,
net was $1.3 million and $3.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The $1.8 million decrease
was principally due to a non-recurring transportation damage settlement in the prior year resulting in greater transportation-related
income at that time.

Interest expense, net. 
Interest expense, net was $7.3 million and $4.5 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase in 2025 was largely due to issuance of the 2029 Notes in late 2024.

Income tax expense. 
The effective tax rate
for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024 was 22.2% and 28.0%, respectively, excluding the impact of discrete items. Discrete
items for the periods included items for management compensation and stock-based compensation. The primary differences from the federal
statutory rate of 21% are related to state taxes, non-deductible expenses, the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, and depletion
expense for income tax purposes.

Earnings per share. 
Refer to Note 11 of
Part I, Item 1 for information regarding earnings per share calculations for Class A and Class B common stock.

Our revenue includes sales of Company-produced
coal and coal purchased from third parties. We include amounts billed by us for transportation to our customers within revenue and transportation
costs incurred within cost of sales.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2025 Compared to Three Months
Ended September 30, 2024

Revenue. 
Coal sales revenue for the three
months ended September 30, 2025 was $121.0 million, approximately 28% lower than the same period in 2024 driven by the negative impact
of pricing and a 15% decrease in tons sold. The decrease in tons sold is attributable to export markets, which decreased by 22% primarily
due to timing differences in shipments to foreign customers. Revenue per ton sold decreased 15% from $164 per ton to $139 per ton while
revenue per ton sold (FOB mine), a non-GAAP measure which excludes transportation revenues and demurrage, also decreased 12% from $136
per ton to $120 per ton. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures later in Item 2 for more information regarding this measure. The decrease
in the Company’s revenue per ton sold measures were due to the decrease in metallurgical coal prices as U.S. metallurgical coal
price indices fell by an average of 18% during the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same period of 2024 as a result
of the macroeconomic conditions discussed earlier. We expect metallurgical coal prices to remain volatile in the near term.

Cost of sales. 
Our cost of coal sales for the three months ended September 30, 2025
was $101.8 million, approximately 24% lower than the same period in 2024 driven by the 15% decrease in tons sold discussed above and operational
efficiencies. Cost of sales per ton sold decreased 10% from $130 per ton to $117 per ton. Cash cost per ton sold 
(FOB mine)
, a non-GAAP
measure which excludes transportation costs and idle mine costs, decreased 5% from $102 per ton to $97 per ton. Refer to 
Non-GAAP Financial
Measures
 later in Item 2 for more information regarding this measure. Mine costs for the third quarter of 2025 benefited from efficiencies
gained from increased production versus the same period in 2024.

Segment adjusted
EBITDA.
 Segment adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $15.9 million, approximately 41% lower
than the same period in 2024 driven by the revenue and cost of sales items discussed above.

Nine Months Ended
September 30, 2025 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024

Revenue.
 Coal
sales revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $408.6 million, approximately 18% lower than the same period in 2024 driven
by the negative impact of pricing, offset by a 1% increase in tons sold. Revenue per ton sold decreased 18% from $173 per ton to $141
per ton while revenue per ton sold (FOB mine), a non-GAAP measure which excludes transportation revenues and demurrage, decreased 16%
from $145 per ton to $122 per ton. The decrease in the Company’s revenue per ton sold measures were due to the decrease in metallurgical
coal prices as U.S. metallurgical coal price indices fell by an average of 19% during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared
to the same period of 2024 as a result of the macroeconomic conditions discussed earlier. We expect metallurgical coal prices to remain
volatile in the near term.

Cost of sales. 
Our cost of coal sales totaled $346.3 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2025 compared to $393.6 million for the same period in 2024. The 12% decrease was driven by the closure of the Jawbone mine
in Q3 2024 and the idling of the Rockhouse Eagle mine in Q2 2025, in addition to reduced trucking costs at the Maben complex subsequent
to commissioning in Q4 2024. Cost of sales per ton sold decreased 12% from $137 per ton to $120 per ton. Cash cost per ton sold (FOB mine),
a non-GAAP measure which excludes transportation costs and idle mine costs, decreased 8% from $109 per ton to $100 per ton. Mine costs
for the first nine months of 2024 were impacted negatively by challenging geology and labor constraints which improved during the same
period of 2025.

Segment adjusted
EBITDA.
 Segment adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2025
was $51.4 million, approximately 40% lower than the same period in 2024 driven by the revenue and cost of sales items discussed above.

Segment adjusted EBITDA.

Segment adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 decreased by approximately $2.4 million and $8.8
million, respectively, compared to the same period in 2024 primarily driven by increased labor and professional service costs to develop
the Brook Mine rare earth elements and critical minerals project in 2025.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The metallurgical coal markets are volatile in
nature; therefore, the Company prioritizes managing its financial position and liquidity, while managing costs and capital expenditures
and returning value to its shareholders.

On May 3, 2024, the Company entered into the
First Amendment Agreement to the Second Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement in order to, among other things, extend the
maturity date and increase the size of its existing Revolving Credit Facility. The amended facility has a maturity date of May 3, 2029,
and provides an initial aggregate revolving commitment of $200 million as well as an accordion feature to increase the size by an additional
$75 million subject to certain terms and conditions, including the lenders’ consent. The amended facility provides the Company
with additional flexibility to pursue further growth in production while meeting normal operating requirements. The terms of the amended
facility also require the Company to maintain certain covenants, including fixed charge coverage ratio and compensating balance requirements.
Borrowings under the amended facility may not exceed the borrowing base as determined under the amended formula included in the agreement.

At September 30, 2025, we had $193.8
million of cash and cash equivalents and $78.6 million of remaining availability under our Revolving Credit Facility for future borrowings.
Cash and cash equivalents include $6.5 million of compensating balances held in dedicated accounts to assure future credit availability
under the revolver. The Company’s total current assets were $328.7 million and were in excess of total current liabilities by $218.2
million as of the balance sheet date.

Significant sources and uses of cash during the
first nine months of 2025

Sources of cash:

●
Cash flows provided by operating activities were $20.3 million
during the nine months ended September 30, 2025, which were driven primarily by net earnings adjusted for non-cash expenses
including depreciation, depletion, and amortization as well as stock-based compensation. Changes in operating assets and liabilities
also contributed to operating cash flow driven primarily by the decrease in accounts receivable due to the collection of fourth quarter
2024 revenues and an increase in inventory.

27

●
Cash inflows for financing activities totaled $196.6 million,
which is primarily driven by:

●
Net proceeds from a Class A common stock equity issuance of $189.0
                                            million;

●
Net proceeds from an Unsecured Senior Note issuance of $64.9 million;

●
Repayment of Unsecured Senior Notes of $34.5 million; and

●
Repayments of $11.1 million on our existing finance leases and insurance
                                            financing

Uses of cash:

●
Cash outflows for investing activities totaled $56.1 million,
which is primarily driven by:

●
Capital expenditures of $52.1 million, including expenditures related
                                            to the preparation plant and expansion of our Maben complex. The preparation plant at Maben
                                            was commissioned in October 2024, which contributed to the reduced trucking costs at the
                                            complex in subsequent periods.

The Class B common stock dividends are calculated
based on 20% of the previous quarter’s CORE royalty and infrastructure fees as shown below. Refer to Note 7 of Part I, Item 1 for

As of the issuance of these financial statements,
the Board of Directors has not declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company anticipates declaring a similar
dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 and on a quarterly basis in future periods; however, future declarations of dividends
are subject to Board of Directors’ approval and may be adjusted as business needs or market conditions change.

28

Future sources and uses of cash

Our primary use of cash includes our investment
in the development of our rare earth elements and critical mineral platform, capital expenditures for mine development, and ongoing operating
expenses. We expect to fund our capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months and the reasonably foreseeable future with
cash on hand, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, projected cash flows from operations, and, if warranted, capital raised
under the Company’s shelf registration discussed below. Factors that could adversely impact our future liquidity and ability to
carry out our capital expenditure program include the following:

●
Project overruns related to the development of the Brook Mine, including
but not limited to increased costs to extract and process rare earth elements and critical minerals into oxides

●
Timely delivery of our product by rail and other transportation
carriers;

●
Late payments of accounts receivable by our customers;

●
Cost overruns in our purchases of equipment needed to complete
our mine development plans;

●
Delays in completion of development of our various mines,
processing plants and refuse disposal facilities, which would reduce the coal we would have available to sell and our cash flow from
operations; and

●
Adverse changes in the metallurgical coal markets that would
reduce the expected cash flow from operations.

If future cash flows were to become insufficient
to meet our liquidity needs or capital requirements, due to changes in macroeconomic conditions or otherwise, we may reduce our expected
level of capital expenditures for new mine production and/or fund a portion of our capital expenditures through the issuance of debt
or equity securities, new debt arrangements, or from other sources such as asset sales.

On August 5, 2025, the Company filed an automatic shelf
registration statement, which was effective upon filing, to sell any combination of Class A common stock, Class B common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt
securities, warrants, and rights. No securities may be sold until a prospectus supplement describing the method and terms of any future
offering is delivered.

Refer to Note 5 of Part I, Item 1 for information
regarding the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and indebtedness.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenue and
expenses reported for the period then ended. A discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates is included in “Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates”
of the Annual Report. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies the nine months ended September 30, 2025.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

A discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements
is included under the heading “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
- Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” in the Annual Report. There were no material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2025.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Adjusted EBITDA - 
Adjusted
EBITDA is used as a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry
analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate
our operating performance.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus net
interest expense; stock-based compensation expense; depreciation, depletion, and amortization expenses; income taxes; accretion of asset
retirement obligations; and, when applicable, certain other non-operating items (income tax penalties and charitable contributions).
A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA is included below. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to serve as a substitute to U.S.
GAAP measures of performance and may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies.

Non-GAAP revenue per ton
sold- 
Non-GAAP revenue per ton sold (FOB mine) is calculated as coal sales revenue less transportation
revenues and demurrage, divided by tons sold. We believe revenue per ton sold (FOB mine) provides useful information to investors as
it enables investors to compare revenue per ton we generate against similar measures made by other publicly-traded coal companies and
more effectively monitor changes in coal prices from period to period excluding the impact of transportation costs which are beyond our
control. The adjustments made to arrive at these measures are significant in understanding and assessing our financial performance. Revenue
per ton sold (FOB mine) is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP and, therefore, should not be considered
as a substitute to revenue under U.S. GAAP.

Non-GAAP cash cost per ton sold - 
Non-GAAP
cash cost per ton sold (FOB mine) is calculated as cash cost of sales less transportation and idle and other costs, divided by tons sold. We believe cash cost per ton sold provides useful information to investors as it enables
investors to compare our cash cost per ton against similar measures made by other publicly-traded coal companies and more effectively
monitor changes in coal cost from period to period excluding the impact of transportation costs which are beyond our control, and alternative
mineral costs, which are more developmentally focused at the present time. The adjustments made to arrive at these measures are significant
in understanding and assessing our financial performance. Cash cost per ton sold (FOB mine) is not a measure of financial performance
in accordance with U.S. GAAP and, therefore, should not be considered as a substitute to cost of sales under U.S. GAAP.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Market Risk

Disclosures about market risk are included in
Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” of our Annual Report.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act,
we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer, who serves
as our principal executive officer, and our chief financial officer, who serves as our principal financial officer, the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period
covered by this quarterly report. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information
required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures,
and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. However, based on
that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report as a result of the material
weakness in internal control over financial reporting as described below.

Previously Reported Material Weakness

We previously identified a material weakness and
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as
a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting disclosed below. The Company’s remediation plan for
the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is also discussed below.

Based on this evaluation, management identified
a material weakness related to an insufficiency of appropriately qualified and trained professionals to perform certain control activities
necessary to achieve our control objectives. The material weakness also resulted in incomplete or inadequate documentation related to
accounting policies and procedures, inappropriate conclusions reached regarding non-routine accounting matters, and insufficient evidence
of internal control activities. A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over
financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was ineffective
as of December 31, 2024.

Remediation Plan

We have executed our plan for remediation to address
the material weakness, which included assessing, redesigning, and implementing modifications of our internal controls, and the hiring
of additional qualified accounting personnel, while supplementing internal resources with qualified external advisors as needed. While
management has taken steps to address the root cause of the material weakness, we will not be able to fully remediate this material weakness
until testing of the amended internal controls have demonstrated their operating effectiveness over a sustained period of financial reporting
cycles.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have taken substantial steps toward improving
our control environment by executing our remediation plan to address the material weakness, as described above. Except as described above,
there were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our third quarter that materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

Senior members of management
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and
all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
of the control system are met. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

Due to the nature of our business, we may become,
from time to time, involved in routine litigation or subject to disputes or claims related to our business activities. While the outcome
of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, in the opinion of our management, there are no pending litigation, disputes or
claims against us which, if decided adversely, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, cash flows or results of operations. For a description of our legal proceedings, see Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Part I of this Quarterly Report.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

In addition to the other information set forth
in this Quarterly Report, you should carefully consider the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading “Item 1A.
Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report and the risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our other SEC filings,
which could materially affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, or future results of operations.

Additional risks and uncertainties not currently
known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or future
results. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those described in our Annual Report.

Our growth prospects may be adversely affected
by fluctuations in demand for, and prices of, rare earth elements and critical minerals.

Changes in the level of demand for, and the market
price of (including taxes and other tariffs and fees imposed upon) rare earth elements and critical minerals could significantly affect
our growth prospects, which depend in large part on our ability to successfully develop the Brook Mine into a producing mine. As is the
case with any mining asset that is not yet in commercial production, there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop
the Brook Mine into a commercial scale mine. In particular, the prices for rare earth elements and critical minerals may fluctuate and
are likely to be affected by numerous factors beyond our control such as interest rates, exchange rates, taxes, inflation, fluctuation
in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, shipping and other transportation and logistics costs, global and
regional supply and demand for rare earth minerals and products, potential industry trends and the political and economic conditions of
countries that produce and procure rare earth elements and critical minerals. In addition, a future change in the U.S. federal administration
could result in changing policies and priorities, including with respect to trade policy and tariffs, taxes and regulation generally,
all of which may have a detrimental impact on the demand for rare earth elements and critical minerals and related products.

Furthermore, supply side factors may have a significant
influence on price volatility for rare earth elements and critical minerals. Supply of rare earth elements and critical minerals is currently
dominated by Chinese producers. The Chinese Central Government regulates production via export bans, quotas and looser environmental standards
compared to other countries, and, to a lesser extent, regulation of imports, and has and may continue to change such export bans, production
quotas, environmental standards, and import regulations. Over the past few years, there has been significant restructuring of the Chinese
market in line with Chinese Central Government policy; however, periods of over-supply or speculative trading of rare earth elements and
critical minerals can lead to significant fluctuations in the market price of such products. A prolonged or significant economic contraction
in the U.S., China, or worldwide could put downward pressure on market prices of rare earth elements and critical minerals. Protracted
periods of low prices for rare earth elements and critical minerals could significantly impact our growth prospects. Demand for rare earth
elements and critical minerals may be impacted by demand for downstream products such as hybrid and electric vehicles, wind turbines,
robotics, medical equipment, military equipment and other high-growth, advanced motion technologies, as well as demand in the general
automotive and electronics industries. By contrast, extended periods of high commodity prices may create economic dislocations that may
be destabilizing to rare earth elements and critical minerals supply and demand and ultimately to the broader markets. Strong rare earth
elements and critical minerals prices may create economic pressure to identify or create alternate technologies that ultimately could
depress long-term demand for rare earth minerals and products, and at the same time may incentivize development of competing mining properties.

Based on all of the above, we cannot provide assurance
that mineralization can be mined or processed profitably.

32

We do not currently have rare earth elements
or critical mineral reserves, and our growth prospects may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully develop the Brook Mine
into a commercial scale mine. 

As described in the Brook Mine – Initial
Assessment technical report summary for the Brook Mine prepared by Weir International, Inc. (September 17, 2025), our estimates of rare
earth elements and critical minerals are reported as in-place inferred resources. Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not
meet the threshold for reserve modifying factors, such as estimated economic viability, that would allow for conversion to mineral reserves.
There is no certainty that any part of the mineral resources estimated will be converted into mineral reserves in the future. Rare earth
elements and critical minerals is a new initiative for us and, as such, has required and will continue to require us to make significant
investments to build out our rare earth element capabilities. As a new facet of our business, there are heightened risks and uncertainties,
and there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop the Brook Mine into a commercial scale mine. We have in the past
pursued alternative strategies and initiatives outside the scope of our core metallurgical mining business that have not to date resulted
in meaningful returns on our investment. We have little to no demonstrated track record of commercial, operational or financial success
outside of our core business, and given the uncertainties associated with rare earth elements and critical minerals and the mining thereof,
we cannot assure you that this initiative will be successful.

An increase in the global supply of rare
earth element products, dumping, predatory pricing and other anti-competitive tactics taken by our competitors may materially and adversely
affect our growth prospects and the price of our common stock.

The pricing of and demand for rare earth element
products is affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including the global macroeconomic environment and the global supply and
demand for products that use rare earth elements and critical minerals. China accounts for the significant majority of global rare earth
element and critical mineral production and also dominates the manufacture of metals from rare earth elements, capabilities that are not
currently present at scale in the U.S. Over the past few years, there has been significant restructuring of the Chinese rare earth element
production industry, further centralizing control over production by state-owned enterprises. Chinese competitors may engage in predatory
pricing or other behaviors designed to inhibit competition. Any increase in the amount of rare earth element products exported from China
or other nations and increased competition may adversely affect our ability to develop Brook Mine into an economically feasible producing
mine or, in the future, our ability to ultimately profitably recover and sell rare earth elements and critical minerals, which could adversely
impact our growth prospects and the price of our common stock. As a result of these factors, we may not be able to compete effectively
against current and future competitors.

Chinese competitors may have greater financial
resources, as well as other strategic advantages to operate, maintain, improve, and possibly expand their facilities. Additionally, our
Chinese competitors have historically been able to produce at relatively low costs due to domestic economic and regulatory factors, including
less stringent environmental and governmental regulations and lower labor and benefit costs. If we are not able to achieve consistent
product quality at our anticipated costs of production, then any strategic advantages that our competitors may have over us, including,
without limitation, lower labor, compliance, and production costs, could have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects and the
price of our common stock.

Consolidation of the rare earth elements
and critical minerals industry may result in increased competition.

Some of our competitors have made, or may make,
acquisitions or enter into partnerships or other strategic relationships to achieve competitive advantages. In addition, new entrants
not currently considered competitors may enter our market through acquisitions, partnerships, or strategic relationships. We expect these
trends to continue as demand for rare earth element materials increases. Industry consolidation may result in competitors with more compelling
product offerings or greater pricing flexibility than we may have, or business practices that make it more difficult for us to compete
effectively, including on the basis of price, sales, technology or supply. For example, in December 2021, China merged three state entities
to establish the China Rare Earth Group Co. Ltd (“China Rare Earth Group”), that accounts for more than half of China’s
heavy rare earths supplies. China Rare Earth Group has enhanced pricing power of key rare earths, such as dysprosium and terbium, which
has brought changes to the global rare earth elements supply chain. These competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on
our growth prospects and the price of our common stock.

33

Changes in tax legislation could have an
adverse impact on our cash tax liabilities, results of operations or financial condition.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”)
reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and included certain other changes that resulted in a significant reduction
of our income tax liability. The recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025 (the “OBBBA”) extends many of the policies
first enacted in the TCJA and introduces new rules that will impact our business. OBBBA provides for the temporary 2.5% Advanced Manufacturing
Production Credit for metallurgical coal. The tax credit for metallurgical coal production is scheduled to terminate after December 31,
2029, limiting our ability to benefit from this incentive to a short window beginning in 2026. Other key provisions of OBBBA include,
but are not limited to, (i) restoration of 100% bonus depreciation for qualified property (e.g., machinery and equipment) acquired and
placed in service after January 19, 2025, repealing the TCJA’s phase-down that began in 2023, and deduction of domestic research
and experimental expenditures in the current period, (ii) new bonus depreciation election allowing the immediate expensing of 100% of
the cost basis of “qualified production property” (e.g., manufacturing facilities placed in service in the United States),
if construction commences after January 19, 2025, and before January 1, 2029, and the asset is placed in service before January 1, 2031,
and (iii) favorable adjustments to the interest deduction rules by permanently restoring the pre-2022 deduction cap on interest expenses
with respect to debt incurred in a trade or business to generally 30% of a taxpayer’s EBITDA (as opposed to 30% of EBIT, as required
under prior law). The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) added a variety of incentives to promote clean energy, many
of which will be reduced or eliminated under the OBBBA. The IRA also added a new corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on adjusted
financial statement income and an excise tax on share buybacks, both of which remain in effect under the OBBBA. Congress could, in the
future, revise or repeal those changes or enact other tax law changes, such as the elimination of tax preferences currently available
with respect to coal exploration and development and the percentage depletion allowance. We are unable to predict whether any such changes
will ultimately be enacted, but any such changes could have a material impact on our cash tax liabilities, results of operations or financial
condition.

Item 5. Other Information

Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements

During the period covered
by this Quarterly Report, none of the Company’s directors or executive officers has 
adopted
 or

arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (each as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended).

Unresolved Staff Comment

The Company received
a comment letter, dated August 19, 2025, from the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance of the SEC (the “Staff”) relating
to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2025. The Staff’s comments principally concern: (i) our
disclosures and public statements regarding the Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) for the Brook Mine rare earth elements
and critical minerals project, including the basis for statements characterizing the project as technically and economically viable in
light of the AACE Class 5 classification and the conceptual nature of the underlying exploration target; (ii) the consistency of our disclosures
regarding the preparation of the PEA under Regulation S-K Subpart 1300 with our release of a Company-prepared summary and references to
the AACE classification system; and (iii) whether our plans to commence carbon ore mining activities and to construct a pilot-scale concentrate
processing facility could result in a material change to our operating results or financial condition in future periods, and our related
considerations under Item 303 of Regulation S-K.

In response, we explained
that the conclusions regarding technical and economic viability referenced in our disclosures were those of Fluor Corporation as set forth
in its PEA, based on then-available information and Company-provided pricing, and that the Class 5 designation reflects the preliminary
level of project definition and expected accuracy for early-stage cost estimates. We also clarified that our Company-prepared PEA summary
was released in accordance with the disclosure framework of Regulation S-K Subpart 1300, that the summary was not a Technical Report Summary
under Subpart 1300 and appropriately referenced the AACE classification system. We committed to update the operating results and financial
conditions if they change in future periods.

We have not received
further communication from the Staff regarding these matters, and the comments therefore remain unresolved as of the date of this Quarterly
Report.
