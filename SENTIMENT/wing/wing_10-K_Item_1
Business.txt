Business
Throughout this report, unless the context indicates otherwise, Wingstop Inc. (NASDAQ: WING) and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to as the “Company,” “Wingstop,” or in the first-person notations of “we,” “us,” and “our.”
General
Wingstop is the largest fast casual chicken wings-focused restaurant chain in the world, with more than 2,550 locations worldwide. The first Wingstop opened in Garland, Texas in 1994, and we began franchising Wingstop restaurants in 1997. Since 2015, Wingstop Inc.’s common stock has traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “WING.” We are dedicated to serving the world flavor through an unparalleled guest experience and offering of classic wings, boneless wings, tenders, and chicken sandwiches, always cooked to order, and hand-sauced-and-tossed in 12 bold, distinctive flavors.
The Company is primarily a franchisor, with approximately 98% of Wingstop’s restaurants currently owned and operated by independent franchisees. We operate in a single segment for reporting purposes and generate revenues by charging royalties, advertising fees, and franchise fees to our franchisees and by operating a number of our own restaurants. We believe our asset-light, highly-franchised business model generates strong operating margins and requires low capital expenditures, creating stockholder value through strong and consistent free cash flow and capital-efficient growth.
Our Brand
It is our mission to serve the world flavor. We offer our guests fresh, cooked-to-order wings, tenders, and chicken sandwiches with bold, layered flavors that touch all of the senses, and we complement our wings, tenders, and chicken sandwiches with fresh-cut, seasoned fries and fresh, hand-cut carrots and celery. We round out the flavor experience with ranch and bleu cheese dips that are made in-house daily. We never use heat lamps or microwaves in the preparation of our food.
Our 12 flavor offerings, along with limited time offerings of special flavors, create a differentiated experience that drives demand across multiple day parts and occasions. Paired with our numerous order options (dine-in / carryout / delivery; individual / combo meals / family packs) that allow guests to enjoy Wingstop during any occasion, whether it is a quick carry-out snack, a party size order for their favorite group occasion, or delivery for a family meal, we believe this customizable unique experience drives repeat business and brand loyalty.
Our Vision
Our vision is to become a Top 10 Global Restaurant Brand. Based on our internal analysis, we believe there is opportunity for our brand to grow to more than 6,000 restaurants across the United States and to more than 4,000 restaurants internationally. Our approach to becoming a Top 10 Global Restaurant Brand centers around the following key strategic priorities:
–
sustaining long-term same store sales growth;
–
maintaining best-in-class returns; and
–
expanding our global footprint.
The foundation of this approach is our culture, which we define as The Wingstop Way, our investment in people as a competitive advantage necessary to continue to scale our organization for the next phase of growth, and our cultivation of a global mindset. 
Sustaining Long-Term Same Store Sales Growth
We believe in sustaining long-term same store sales growth through a combination of brand awareness, menu innovation, delivery, data-driven marketing and maximizing our digital leadership position. Our national advertising program is funded through the Wingstop Restaurants Advertising Fund (the “Ad Fund”), a consolidated not-for-profit advertising fund for which a percentage of gross sales is collected from Wingstop restaurant domestic franchisees and company-owned restaurants to be used for various forms of advertising for the Wingstop brand. Domestic franchisees are required to contribute 5.3% of gross sales to the Ad Fund. The national advertising program supports elevated marketing spend and premium placements through an extensive range of social media and digital marketing channels, including search engine, digital video, and social media advertising, to allow us to target core customers and create top of mind consideration with relevant, impactful messaging.

The national advertising program also supports our digital initiatives and related strategies, including our focused investments in customer relationship management and our proprietary digital platform, which allows us to deploy a digital platform-based marketing strategy. As a result of these investments, we continue to sustain digital sales above 60%. 
Maintaining Best-in-Class Unit Economics
We believe the growing popularity of the Wingstop experience and the operational simplicity of our restaurants translate into attractive economics at our franchised and company-owned locations. Existing franchisees accounted for more than 90% of franchised restaurants opened in each of 2023 and 2024, which we believe further underscores our restaurant model’s financial appeal. 
Upon the opening of a new restaurant, its sales volume generally builds year after year. Our domestic average unit volume (“AUV”) has grown consistently, approximating $2.1 million during fiscal year 2024. Our domestic operating model provides for a low average initial investment of approximately $535,000, excluding real estate purchase or lease costs and pre-opening expenses. In year two of operation of a new restaurant, we target a franchisee unlevered cash-on-cash return of approximately 70%+. We believe low entry costs and high returns provide a compelling investment opportunity for our franchisees that has helped drive the continued growth of our system. 
Expanding Our Global Footprint
We believe in the importance of building one global brand with a distinctive flavor experience that is consistent around the globe. This includes laying the groundwork for a global supply chain to support expansion of our global footprint, as well as creating a consistent digital presence centered around our global technology strategy which includes expanding our best-in-class domestic digital platform internationally.
We believe that there is significant opportunity to continue to expand globally, and we intend to focus our efforts on increasing our geographic penetration in both existing and new domestic markets, as well as international markets. We believe our highly-franchised model positions us for continued strong unit growth over the medium- and long-term. We expect franchisee demand for our brand, supported by compelling unit economics, operational simplicity, low entry costs, and flexible real estate profile, to drive global restaurant growth.  
We believe we can achieve our domestic restaurant potential by doubling our current footprint through expansion in both existing and emerging markets. Our domestic market expansion strategy focuses on maximizing our brand market share and visibility in key priority markets. We have a robust development pipeline with approximately 90% of our domestic commitments as of December 28, 2024 from existing franchisees, supporting the strength of our restaurant business model and our positive franchisor-franchisee relationships. 
We also believe that there is a significant opportunity to grow our business internationally. In fiscal year 2024, we opened 71 net new international restaurants, and as of December 28, 2024, we had 359 international restaurants located in 11 countries and U.S. territories, all of which were franchised.
We believe that our restaurant operating model translates well internationally based on our small real estate footprint, our simplicity of operations, the universal and broad appeal of chicken, and our ability to customize our wide variety of flavors to local tastes. 
Our Franchise
Franchise Overview
Our franchisees operated a total of 2,513 restaurants in 45 states and 12 countries and U.S. territories as of December 28, 2024. We have rigorous qualification criteria and training programs for our franchisees and require them to adhere to strict operating standards. We work hard to ensure that every Wingstop franchise location meets the same quality and customer service benchmarks in order to preserve the consistency and reliability of the Wingstop brand.
Franchisees (along with their managers) must attend and successfully complete a four-week training program prior to opening a new franchise restaurant. Our training program covers various topics including Wingstop culture, food preparation and storage, food safety, cleaning and sanitation, marketing and advertising, point of sale (“POS”) systems, accounting, and hospitality, among others.

All of our franchise agreements require that each franchised restaurant be operated in accordance with our defined operating procedures, adhere to the menu we establish, and meet applicable quality, service, health, and cleanliness standards. We may terminate the franchise rights of any franchisee who does not comply with our standards and requirements. We believe that maintaining superior food quality, an inviting and energetic atmosphere, and excellent guest service are critical to the reputation and success of our concept. Therefore, we enforce the contractual requirements of our franchise agreements.
We have a broad and diversified domestic franchisee base. Since 2014, the number of franchisees who own ten or more restaurants has more than doubled. This increase is consistent with our strategy to grow with our existing franchisees. As of December 28, 2024, our domestic franchise base of 196 franchisees had an average restaurant ownership of approximately eleven restaurants per franchisee and an average tenure of ten years. 
U.S. Franchise Agreements
We enter into area development agreements with U.S. franchisees, pursuant to which they are granted the right to develop restaurants in a defined market area.

Franchisees pay a $10,000 development fee per restaurant to-be-developed

at the time a development agreement is signed, which fee

is not refundable.

When a mutually agreeable site for a restaurant has been chosen, we enter into a franchise agreement with the franchisee, under which the franchisee is generally granted the right to operate a restaurant in a particular location, typically providing for a 10-year initial term, with an opportunity to enter into one or more renewal franchise agreements subject to certain conditions. We generally update and/or revise our franchise agreement on an annual basis and, as a result, the agreements we enter into with individual franchisees may vary. Our franchise documents currently provide that franchisees must pay a franchise fee of $20,000 for each restaurant opened. 
Under our current standard franchise agreement, each franchisee is required to pay us a royalty of 6% of their gross sales net of discounts. Each restaurant also contributes 5.3% of gross sales net of discounts to the Ad Fund to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns. The national advertising fund contribution rate increased to 5.3% from 5%, effective the first day of the fiscal second quarter 2024. These funds are managed by the Ad Fund and are primarily used to create advertising content and purchase digital and television advertising on a national level, as well as to support digital and technology-related costs. Beginning the fiscal first quarter of 2025, the advertising fund contribution rate will increase to 5.5% to support digital and technology-related costs. 
International Franchise Agreements
Our markets outside of the United States are operated by master franchisees with franchise and distribution rights for entire regions or countries. The master franchise agreement typically requires the franchisees to open a minimum number of restaurants within a specified period. The master franchisee is generally required to pay an initial, upfront development fee for the territory as well as a franchise fee for each restaurant opened. Under our current standard master franchise agreement, each master franchisee is also required to pay a continuing royalty fee as a percentage of sales, which varies among international markets, but is currently set at 6%. 
Suppliers and Distribution 
Our franchisees are required to purchase all chicken, groceries, produce, beverages, equipment and signage, furniture, fixtures, logo-imprinted paper goods, and cleaning supplies solely from suppliers that we designate and approve. Our supply partners are required to meet strict quality standards. We regularly inspect vendors to ensure our standards are being met and that prices offered are competitive. We also have a Global Supplier Code of Conduct that outlines the standards and business practices that we expect of all our direct and extended suppliers as we strive to meet the highest standards of business conduct.  
The principal raw materials for a Wingstop restaurant operation are bone-in and boneless chicken wings, tenders, and chicken fillets. Therefore, chicken is our largest product cost item and represented approximately 57.6% of all purchases for the 2024 fiscal year. Company-owned and franchised restaurants purchase their bone-in and boneless chicken wings, chicken tenders, and chicken fillets from suppliers that we designate and approve. Our chicken supply is diversified both geographically and with a broad range of suppliers supporting the Wingstop system. We designate sources for potatoes to ensure that they are grown to our specifications. We also require franchisees to use our proprietary sauces, seasonings, and spice blends and to purchase them and other proprietary products only from designated sources. 
All food items and packaging goods for Wingstop restaurants in the U.S. are currently supplied through one distributor. Currently, there are 21 geographically diverse distribution centers, which carry all products required for a Wingstop restaurant and service all of Wingstop’s domestic restaurants. The distributor is contractually obligated to deliver products to our restaurants at least twice weekly, and provides consolidated deliveries with a tightly controlled and monitored cold chain for 
7
perishable items. The distributor’s national distribution system has a documented recovery plan to handle any disruption. Wingstop contracts directly with manufacturers to sell products to the distributor, who in turn receives a fee for delivering these items to our restaurants. The majority of Wingstop’s highest-spend items are formula or fixed-contract priced. Wingstop has also negotiated agreements with its beverage suppliers to offer beverage dispensing systems, along with associated branded products, in all Wingstop restaurants.
Information / Technology Systems
We have core information systems in place that, together with focused investments we are making in technology (including our proprietary digital platform), we believe are designed to scale and support our future growth plans. We specify a POS system and restaurant management system in all domestic restaurants that help facilitate the operation of the restaurants by recording sales, purchasing and inventory of goods, managing of labor and assessing restaurant performance. Our POS system and restaurant management system is configured to record and store financial information in a manner that we specify, and we require franchisees to provide us with continual and unlimited independent access to all information on each POS system.
We have a proprietary online ordering platform and mobile ordering applications that integrate with third party delivery providers and our POS system, which makes it easy for our guests to order-ahead, and which we believe leads to higher check averages.
We require our franchisees’ electronic information systems, including POS systems, to comply with and be maintained in accordance with established network security standards, including applicable Payment Card Industry and data privacy standards.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 28, 2024, we employed 1,335 employees, affectionately referred to as “team members,” of whom 325 were full-time corporate-based and regional personnel. The remainder were part-time or restaurant-level team members. None of our team members are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that we have good relations with our team members. Our franchise owners are independent business owners, so they and their employees are not considered our team members and are therefore not included in our team member count. 
Our human capital objectives include attracting, retaining, and accelerating the growth of our team members. Our team member programs are designed to develop talent and prepare team members for advancement and leadership positions in the future; provide market-competitive pay and benefits; focus on team members’ health, safety and well-being; enhance our culture through our continuing efforts to make our workplace more engaging and inclusive; and acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing and diverse workforce. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We are committed to fostering an environment of diversity, equity, and inclusion, including among our board of directors, and having diverse representation across all levels of our workforce. Examples of some of our recent efforts and metrics include:
•
diversity and inclusion education training was offered to team members throughout the year;
•
65% of our franchisees and 50% of our board of directors identify as diverse;
•
90% of our team members identify as diverse; and
•
we are a member of the Women’s Foodservice Forum and the Multicultural Foodservice & Hospitality Alliance Group.
We are also committed to providing competitive pay to compensate and reward our team members. All corporate management and staff and restaurant management positions for company-owned restaurants, including hourly assistant managers and shift leaders, are eligible for performance-based cash incentives. Our incentive plan reinforces and rewards individuals for achievement of specific company and/or restaurant business goals.
We offer comprehensive benefit programs to eligible team members. Our core health and welfare benefits are supplemented with a variety of voluntary benefits and paid time away from work programs. We maintain a strong focus on team member well-being, health and safety.
We invest in people and infrastructure to build the organization for the next level. In addition to seeking to acquire new talent in the marketplace that share our values and goals, we recognize and support the growth and development of our team members 
8
and offer opportunities to participate in regular talent and development planning reviews to assist us with growing our internal restaurant teams.
Government Regulation

We and our franchisees are subject to various federal regulations affecting the operation of our business. We and our franchisees are subject to the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act, the U.S. Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and various other federal and state laws governing matters such as minimum wage requirements, overtime, fringe benefits, workplace safety and other working conditions and citizenship requirements. A significant number of our and our franchisees’ food service personnel are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage, and past increases in the minimum wage have increased our and our franchisees’ labor costs, as would future increases. Our distributors and suppliers also may be affected by higher minimum wage and benefit standards, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us and our franchisees.
We are subject to extensive and varied state and local government regulation affecting the operation of our business, as are our franchisees, including regulations relating to public and occupational health and safety, sanitation, fire prevention, and franchise operation. Each Wingstop restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, including with respect to zoning, health, safety, the preparation and sale of food, sanitation, food safety, nutritional information disclosure, environmental, and building and fire safety, in the jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located. Our and our franchisees’ licenses to sell alcoholic beverages must be renewed annually and may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause, including violation by us or our employees, or our franchisees or their employees, of any law or regulation pertaining to alcoholic beverage control, such as those regulating the minimum age of patrons or employees, advertising, wholesale purchasing, and inventory control.
In addition, we are subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC and various state franchise laws require that we furnish a franchise disclosure document containing certain information to prospective franchisees in advance of any franchise sale or the receipt of any consideration for the franchise, and a number of states require registration of the franchise disclosure document at least annually with state authorities. We are operating under exemptions from registration (though not disclosure) in several states based on our qualifications for exemption as set forth in each such state’s laws. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship, including in the areas of termination and non-renewal, presently exist in a substantial number of states. We believe that our franchise disclosure document and franchising procedures comply in all material respects with both the FTC guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises.
Our international franchised restaurants are subject to national and local laws and regulations that are often similar to those affecting our U.S. restaurants. We believe that we have established procedures at our international franchised restaurants that provide reasonable assurance that our international franchised restaurants comply in all material respects with the laws of the applicable foreign jurisdiction.
Other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the section entitled “Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry” and listed in “
