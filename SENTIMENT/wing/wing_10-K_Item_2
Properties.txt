Properties
The Company leases an office building in Dallas, Texas containing approximately 112,200 square feet, which we use as our corporate headquarters and global support center. We also own a 78,000 square foot office building in Addison, Texas, which we are currently evaluating for future use, and which has not been leased, rented, or currently utilized. 
All company-owned restaurant real estate facilities are leased by us, typically under five- to ten-year leases with one or two five-year renewal options, often containing rent escalation provisions, and generally requiring us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance and common area and other operating costs in addition to base or fixed rent. All domestic and international franchise restaurants are leased or owned directly by the respective franchisees. 
Due to lower square footage requirements, our restaurants can be located in a variety of locations. They tend to be located primarily in shopping centers, as in-line or end-cap locations. Our restaurants generally occupy approximately 1,700 square feet of leased retail space. As of December 28, 2024, we and our franchisees operated 2,563 restaurants in 45 states and 12 countries and U.S. territories.
