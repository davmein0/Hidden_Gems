Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties. 
A comparison of our results of operations and cash flows for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 can be found under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024.
We operate on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday of each calendar year. Our fiscal quarters are comprised of 13 weeks, with the exception of the fourth quarter of a 53-week year, which contains 14 weeks. Fiscal years 2024 and 2023 each contain 52 weeks, while fiscal year 2022 contains 53 weeks.
Overview

Wingstop is the largest fast casual chicken wings-focused restaurant chain in the world and has demonstrated strong, consistent growth. As of December 28, 2024, we had a total of 2,563 restaurants in our system. Our restaurant base is 98% franchised, with 2,513 franchised locations (including 359 international locations) and 50 company-owned restaurants as of December 28, 2024. We generate revenues by charging royalties, advertising fees and franchise fees to our franchisees and by operating a number of our own restaurants. 
We plan to grow our business by opening new franchised restaurants and increasing our same store sales, while leveraging our franchise model to create shareholder value. Domestic same store sales have increased for 21 consecutive years beginning in 2004, which includes 3-year cumulative domestic same stores sales growth of 41.6% since the beginning of fiscal year 2022. We believe our asset-light, highly-franchised business model generates strong operating margins and requires low capital expenditures, creating shareholder value through strong and consistent operating cash flow and capital-efficient growth.

Key Performance Indicators 
Key measures that we use in evaluating our restaurants and assessing our business include the following: 
Number of restaurants. 
Management reviews the number of new restaurants, the number of closed restaurants, and the number of acquisitions and divestitures of restaurants to assess net new restaurant growth, system-wide sales, royalty and franchise fee revenue, and company-owned restaurant sales.

System-wide sales. 
System-wide sales represents net sales for all of our company-owned and franchised restaurants (as reported by franchisees). This measure allows management to better assess changes in our royalty revenue, our overall store performance, the health of our brand and the strength of our market position relative to competitors. Our system-wide sales growth is driven by new restaurant openings as well as increases in same store sales.

Domestic average unit volume (“AUV”).
 Domestic

AUV consists of the average annual sales of all restaurants that have been open for a trailing 52-week period or longer. This measure is calculated by dividing sales during the applicable period for all restaurants being measured by the number of restaurants being measured. Domestic AUV includes revenue from both company-owned and franchised restaurants. Domestic AUV allows management to assess our domestic company-owned and franchised restaurant economics. Changes in domestic AUV are primarily driven by increases in same store sales and are also influenced by opening new restaurants.

Domestic same store sales. 
Domestic same store sales reflects the change in year-over-year sales for the same store base. We define the same store base to include those restaurants open for at least 52 full weeks. This measure highlights the performance of existing restaurants, while excluding the impact of new restaurant openings and permanent closures. We review same store sales for domestic company-owned restaurants as well as system-wide domestic restaurants. Domestic same store sales growth is driven by increases in transactions and average transaction size. Transaction size increases are driven by price increases or favorable mix shift from either an increase in items purchased or shifts into higher priced items.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.
 We define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, net, income tax expense (benefit), and depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, net, income tax expense (benefit), and depreciation and amortization, with further adjustments for losses on debt extinguishment and financing transactions, transaction costs, costs and fees associated with investments in our strategic initiatives, system implementation costs, and stock-based compensation expense. For a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and for further discussion of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as non-GAAP measures and how we utilize them, see footnote 2 below.

The percentage of system-wide sales attributable to company-owned restaurants was 2.5% and 2.8% for the fiscal years ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively. The remainder was generated by franchised restaurants, as reported by our franchisees.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. These should not be viewed as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. 
We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by our competitors, because not all companies and analysts calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Management believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these non-GAAP financial measures as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations. Many investors are interested in understanding the performance of our business by comparing our results from ongoing operations on a period-over-period basis and would ordinarily add back non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, as well as items that are not part of normal day-to-day operations of our business. 
Management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: 
•
as a measurement of operating performance because they assist us in comparing the operating performance of our restaurants on a consistent basis, as they remove the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations; 
•
for planning purposes, including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget and financial projections; 
•
to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies; 
•
to evaluate our capacity to fund capital expenditures and expand our business; and 
•
to calculate incentive compensation payments for our employees, including assessing performance under our annual incentive compensation plan and determining the vesting of performance-based equity awards. 
By providing these non-GAAP financial measures, together with a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure, we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of our business and our results of operations, as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as an alternative to, or a substitute for net income or other financial statement data presented in our consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance. Some of the limitations are: 
•
such measures do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
•
such measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;
•
such measures do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; 
33
•
such measures do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; 
•
although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and such measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and 
•
other companies in our industry may calculate such measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. 
Due to these limitations, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our GAAP results and using these non-GAAP measures only as performance measures and only supplementally. As noted in the table below, Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments for losses on debt extinguishment and financing transactions, transaction costs, costs and fees associated with investments in our strategic initiatives, system implementation costs, and stock-based compensation expense. We believe these adjustments are appropriate because the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of our restaurants, and complicate comparisons of our internal operating results and operating results of other restaurant companies over time. Each of the normal recurring adjustments and other adjustments described in this paragraph and in the reconciliation table below help management measure our core operating performance over time by removing items that are not related to day-to-day operations.

Given the magnitude and scope of this strategic review initiative that is not expected to recur in the foreseeable future, the Company considers the incremental consulting fees incurred with respect to the initiative not reflective of the ongoing costs to operate its business.

Revenue
During

fiscal year 2024, total revenue was $625.8 million, an increase of $165.8 million, or 36.0%, compared to $460.1 million in the prior fiscal year. 
Royalty revenue, franchise fees and other increased $81.3 million, of which $36.1 million was due to domestic same store sales growth of 19.9%, and $29.9 million was due to net new franchise development since December 30, 2023. Other revenue increased by $7.2 million primarily due to an increase in vendor rebates.
Advertising fees increased $60.5 million, of which $51.0

million was due to a 36.8% increase in system-wide sales during fiscal year 2024, and $9.5 million was due to an increase in the national advertising fund contribution rate to 5.3% from 5.0% effective the first day of the fiscal second quarter 2024. 
Company-owned restaurant sales increased $24.0 million, of which $16.0 million was related to company-owned same store sales growth of 7.7%, driven primarily by an increase in transactions, and $8.0 million was primarily related to company-owned restaurants opened and acquired during fiscal year 2024.

Food, beverage and packaging costs as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales were 36.2% in fiscal year 2024 compared to 33.1% in the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to a 43.0% increase in the cost of bone-in chicken wings as compared to the prior year period. Our purchases in the prior fiscal year period were tied primarily to the spot market, which benefited from significant deflation in the cost of bone-in chicken wings. During fiscal year 2024, we were able to move the majority of our purchases of bone-in chicken wings away from the spot market to provide more predictable food cost.  
Labor costs as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales were 23.6% in fiscal year 2024 compared to 24.0% in the prior fiscal year. The decrease is primarily due to sales leverage related to the company-owned domestic same store sales increase of 7.7%, offset by an increase in company-owned restaurant wages.
Other restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales were 19.2% in fiscal year 2024 compared to 19.1% in the prior fiscal year. The increase as a percentage of company-owned restaurant sales was primarily due to an increase in the national advertising fund contribution rate to 5.3% from 5.0% effective the first day of the fiscal second quarter 2024, partially offset by sales leverage related to the company-owned domestic same store sales increase of 7.7%.
Advertising expenses
Advertising expenses were $233.3 million, an increase of $66.7 million, compared to $166.6 million in fiscal year 2023. Advertising expenses are recognized at the same time the related revenue is recognized, which does not necessarily correlate to the actual timing of the related advertising spend.
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”)
SG&A was $116.8 million in fiscal year 2024, an increase of $19.9 million, or 20.5%, compared to $96.9 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase in SG&A expense was driven by an increase in headcount-related expenses of $10.2 million to support the growth in our business, an increase in performance-based stock compensation and incentive compensation expense of $7.6 million related primarily to the Company’s performance, and an increase in professional and consulting fees of $1.2 million associated with the Company’s strategic initiatives, including system implementation costs.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization was $19.5 million in fiscal year 2024, an increase of $6.3 million, or 47.2%, compared to $13.2 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to software assets placed into service during fiscal year 2024 that relate to the launch of our proprietary technology platform: MyWingstop.
Interest expense, net
Interest expense, net was $21.3 million in fiscal year 2024, an increase of $3.1 million, or 16.8%, compared to $18.2 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by less interest income earned during fiscal year 2024 due to higher cash balances during fiscal year 2023. 
Income tax expense
The effective tax rate in fiscal year 2024 was 26.1%, compared to an effective tax rate of 25.6% in the prior fiscal year. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in non-deductible expenses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
General. 
Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash provided from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, and borrowings available under our securitized financing facility. Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, general corporate needs, capital expenditures, income tax payments, debt service requirements, 
36
and dividend payments. Historically, we have operated with minimal positive working capital or with negative working capital. We generally utilize available cash flows from operations to invest in our business, service our debt obligations, and pay dividends. As of December 28, 2024, the Company had $359.6 million of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet, including advertising fund cash and cash equivalents. 
Based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth, we expect that cash flows from operations, combined with our securitized financing facility including our Variable Funding Notes, will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future.

Operating activities
. Our cash flows from operating activities are principally driven by sales at both franchise restaurants and company-owned restaurants, as well as franchise fees. We collect franchise royalties from our franchise owners on a weekly basis. Restaurant-level operating costs at our company-owned restaurants, unearned franchise fees, and corporate overhead costs also impact our cash flows from operating activities. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $157.6 million in fiscal year 2024, an increase of $36.0 million from cash provided by operating activities of $121.6 million in the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to an increase in operating income, as well as changes in Ad Fund cash and cash equivalents, directly related to the timing of payments for expenses incurred for national advertising.
Investing activities
. Our net cash used in investing activities was $62.5 million in fiscal year 2024, an increase of $10.3 million, from $52.2 million in fiscal year 2023. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures related to our technology investments, as well as the impact of additional restaurants acquired from franchisees as compared to the prior fiscal year period, partially offset by the sale of seven company-owned restaurants to a franchisee in fiscal year 2024.
Financing activities
. Our net cash provided by financing activities was $144.8 million in fiscal year 2024, a change of $300.3 million, from net cash used in financing activities of $155.5 million in fiscal year 2023. The change is primarily related to the net cash provided by additional borrowings under our 2024 Class A-2 Notes (as defined below) of $500 million in fiscal year 2024, partially offset by an increase of $189.3 million in common stock repurchased under our share repurchase program as compared to the prior fiscal year.
Securitized financing facility
. On December 3, 2024, the Company completed a securitized financing transaction, in which Wingstop Funding LLC, a limited purpose, bankruptcy-remote, indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Issuer”), issued $500 million of its Series 2024-1 5.858% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2 (the “2024 Class A-2 Notes”). The Issuer also increased the capacity of its revolving financing facility of Series 2022-1 Variable Funding Senior Notes, Class A-1 (the “Variable Funding Notes”) from $200 million to $300 million. Following the increase, borrowing capacity under the Variable Funding Notes permits borrowings of up to a maximum principal amount of $300 million, a portion of which may be used to issue letters of credit. The 2024 Class A-2 Notes and the Variable Funding Notes are referred to collectively as the “2024 Notes.” The proceeds from the securitized financing transaction were used to pay related transaction fees and expenses, strengthen the Company's liquidity position and for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of shares of the Company’s common stock.
In addition to the 2024 Notes, the Company’s outstanding debt consists of its existing Series 2022-1 3.734% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2 (the “2022 Notes”) and Series 2020-1 2.84% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2 (the “2020 Notes”). No borrowings were outstanding under the Variable Funding Notes as of December 28, 2024.
37
Dividends
. We paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share of common stock in each of the first two quarters of 2024, and quarterly cash dividends of $0.27 per share of common stock in both the third and fourth quarters of 2024, resulting in aggregate quarterly dividend payments of $28.7 million in fiscal year 2024. On February 18, 2025, the Company’s board of directors approved a dividend of $0.27 per share, to be paid on March 28, 2025 to stockholders of record as of March 7, 2025, totaling approximately $7.7 million.
We do not currently expect the restrictions in our debt instruments to impact our ability to make regular quarterly dividends pursuant to our quarterly dividend program. However, any future declarations of dividends, as well as the amount and timing of such dividends, is subject to capital availability and the discretion of our board of directors, which must evaluate, among other things, whether cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders.
Share Repurchase Program.
 On August 17, 2023, the Company’s board of directors approved a new share repurchase program with authorization to repurchase up to $250.0 million of its outstanding shares of common stock (the “August 2023 Authorization”). On August 23, 2023, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the “2023 ASR Agreement”) with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $125.0 million of the Company’s common stock as part of the August 2023 Authorization. Under the 2023 ASR Agreement, the Company paid the financial institution $125.0 million in cash and received and retired a total of 645,952 shares of common stock at an average share price of $193.51. Final settlement of the ASR Agreement occurred on December 21, 2023.
On December 5, 2024, the Company’s board of directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional $500.0 million of its outstanding shares of common stock under its existing share repurchase program (the “December 2024 Authorization” and together with the August 2023 Authorization, the “Share Repurchase Program”), following the substantial completion of purchases of common stock under the August 2023 Authorization. 
On December 9, 2024, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the “2024 ASR Agreement”) with a third-party financial institution to repurchase $250.0 million of the Company’s common stock under its Share Repurchase Program. Pursuant to the ASR Agreement, during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 the Company  made an initial payment to the financial institution of $250.0 million in cash and received and retired an initial delivery of 551,325 shares of common stock, representing an estimated 75% of the total shares expected to be delivered under the ASR Agreement, based on the closing price on the date of initial delivery of $328.54. The delivery of any remaining shares will occur at the final settlement of the transactions under the ASR Agreement, which is scheduled to occur in the fiscal first quarter of 2025. The number of shares to be delivered upon final settlement is based on the daily volume-weighted average share prices during the valuation period specified in the ASR Agreement, less a discount and subject to adjustments. 
During fiscal year 2024, the Company repurchased and retired 720,804 shares at an average share price of $339.95, inclusive of the shares repurchased under the 2024 ASR Agreement. During fiscal year 2023, the Company repurchased and retired 645,952 shares at an average share price of $193.51 under the 2023 ASR Agreement. As of December 28, 2024, $311.1 million remained available under the Share Repurchase Program. Since the inception of the Company’s share repurchase program in August 2023, the Company has repurchased and retired 1,366,756 shares of its common stock at an average price of $272.89 per share.
Contractual Obligations 
Our cash requirements greater than twelve months from contractual obligations and commitments include: 
Debt Obligations and Interest Payments.
 Refer to “Note 11 - Debt Obligations” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information of our obligations and the timing of expected payments. 
Operating Leases.
 Refer to “Note 12 - Leases” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information of our obligations and the timing of expected payments. 
Indemnifications.
 We are parties to certain indemnification obligations to third parties in the ordinary course of business. We believe the probability of incurring an actual liability under such indemnifications is sufficiently remote so that no liability has been recorded.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates may require application of management’s most 
38
difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. While we apply our judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could vary from these assumptions. It is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using different assumptions. Our most significant accounting policies and estimates are more fully described in “Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, we believe the accounting policies described below are particularly important to the portrayal and understanding of our financial position and results of operations.
Revenue Recognition
Revenues consist primarily of royalties, national advertising fund contributions, initial and renewal franchise fees, and upfront fees from development agreements and international territory agreements. The Company's performance obligations under its franchise agreements consist of (a) a franchise license, (b) pre-opening services, such as training, and (c) ongoing services, such as management of Ad Fund contributions, development of training materials and menu items, and restaurant monitoring. These performance obligations are highly interrelated, so they are not considered to be individually distinct and therefore are accounted for as a single performance obligation, which is satisfied by providing a right to use the Company's intellectual property over the term of each franchise agreement. Franchise fee, development fee and international territory fee payments received by the Company before the restaurant opens are recorded as deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Royalties, including franchisee contributions to the Ad Fund, are calculated as a percentage of franchise restaurant sales over the term of the franchise agreement. Initial and renewal franchise fees are payable by the franchisee prior to the restaurant opening or at the time of a renewal of an existing franchise agreement. The Company's franchise agreement royalties, inclusive of Ad Fund contributions, represent sales-based royalties that are related entirely to the Company's performance obligation under the franchise agreement and are recognized as franchised restaurant sales occur, payable weekly. Additionally, initial and renewal franchise fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective agreement. The Company's performance obligation under development agreements and international territory agreements generally consists of an obligation to grant exclusive development rights over a stated term. These development rights are not distinct from franchise agreements, so upfront fees paid by franchisees for development rights are apportioned to each franchised restaurant opened and accounted for as an initial franchise fee. 
Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures of Market Risks
Commodity Price Risk. 
We are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices. Many of the food products purchased by us are affected by weather, production, availability, and other factors outside our control. Although we enter into arrangements in an effort to mitigate the price volatility of food costs, there are no established fixed price markets for fresh bone-in chicken wings, so we may be subject to prevailing market conditions. Bone-in chicken wings accounted for approximately 19.8% and 16.8% of our company-owned restaurant costs of sales in fiscal years 2024 and 2023. A hypothetical 10.0% increase in the bone-in chicken wing costs in fiscal year 2024 would have increased company-owned restaurant costs of sales by approximately $1.8 million during the year. We do not engage in speculative financial transactions nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Interest Rate Risk. 
Our long-term debt, including current portion, consisted entirely of the $1,220.9 million incurred under the 2024 Notes, 2022 Notes and 2020 Notes as of December 28, 2024 (excluding unamortized debt issuance costs). The Company’s predominantly fixed-rate debt structure has reduced its exposure to interest rate increases that could adversely affect its earnings and cash flows, but the Company remains exposed to changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and to the risk that the Company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate. The Company is exposed to interest rate increases under the Variable Funding Notes; however, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its Variable Funding Notes as of December 28, 2024.

Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 28, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The management of Wingstop Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)
. Based on such assessment our management has concluded that, as of December 28, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
Wingstop Inc.: 
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
We have audited Wingstop Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 19, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. 
Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors 
Wingstop Inc.: 
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Wingstop Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 19, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion 
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained over royalty revenue and advertising fees
As discussed in Notes 1 and 17 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized $259.6 million of royalty revenue and $217.6 million of advertising fees for the year ended December 28, 2024. Royalty revenue and advertising fees are calculated as a percentage of franchise restaurant sales over the term of the franchise agreement.
We identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained over royalty revenue and advertising fees as a critical audit matter. This evaluation required subjective auditor judgement due to the highly automated nature of certain processes to record revenue that involve interfacing data across multiple IT systems. The complexity of the IT environment required the involvement of IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge.
The following are the primary procedures performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgement to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over the processing and recording of revenue, including the 
F-2
determination of IT systems for which those procedures were performed. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the processing and recording of revenue. We involved IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in testing certain general IT and automated internal controls over IT systems used for the processing and recording of revenue. We compared revenue recognized to cash received for royalty revenue and advertising fees. We confirmed with a sample of franchisees regarding the amount of royalties and advertising fees that they owed to the Company. In addition, we evaluated the overall sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained over royalty revenue and advertising fees by assessing the results of procedures performed.

WINGSTOP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(1)
Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Overview
Wingstop Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, “Wingstop” or the “Company”), is in the business of franchising and operating Wingstop restaurants. As of December 28, 2024, the Company had a total of 
2,563
 restaurants in its system. The Company's restaurant base is 
98
% franchised, with 
2,513
 franchised restaurants (including 
359
 international restaurants) and 
50
 company-owned restaurants as of December 28, 2024. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a)
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Wingstop Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
(b)
Fiscal Year End
The Company uses a 52/53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Saturday of the calendar year. Fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 included 52, 52, and 53 weeks, respectively. The 53
rd
 week in fiscal 2022 fell in the fiscal fourth quarter.
(c)
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions, primarily related to long-lived asset valuation, indefinite and finite lived intangible asset valuation, income taxes, investments, leases, stock-based compensation, contingencies, and common stock equity valuations. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Although management bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results could differ from those estimates.
(d)
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
The Company continually monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions in which it maintains its deposits and investments. As of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, the Company maintained balances in various cash accounts in excess of federally insured limits. All highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.
Restricted cash includes cash and cash equivalents held for future principal and interest payments as required by the Company's debt agreements (see Note 11). The Company also has Advertising fund restricted cash, which can only be used for activities related to the promotion of the Wingstop brand.

F-8
Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash within the Consolidated Balance Sheets that are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were as follows (in thousands):

$

$

(e)
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, consists primarily of accrued royalty fee receivables, collected weekly in arrears, and vendor rebates. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical losses and current economic conditions. On a continuing basis, management analyzes delinquent receivables, which are charged off against the existing allowance account when determined to be uncollectible.
(f)
Inventories
Inventories, which consist of food and beverage products, paper goods, and supplies, are valued at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or net realizable value.
(g)
Cloud Computing Arrangements
Cloud computing arrangements (“CCA”) are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization. The Company capitalizes implementation costs associated with its cloud computing arrangements, which are recorded net of amortization in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and “Other assets.” CCA implementation costs are amortized over the term of the related hosting agreement, including renewal periods that are reasonably certain to be exercised. CCA implementation costs are included within operating activities in the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows.

(h)
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes all direct costs necessary to acquire and prepare assets for use or to develop or obtain internal-use software, including internal labor.

Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:
Property and Equipment
Estimated Useful Lives
Building
40
 years
Leasehold and other improvements
Lesser of 
7
 to 
10
 years or the expected lease term
Equipment, furniture and fixtures
3
 to 
7
 years
Capitalized software
3
 to 
10
 years
At the time property and equipment are retired, the asset and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is included in earnings. The Company expenses repair and maintenance costs that maintain the appearance and functionality of the restaurant but do not extend the useful life of any restaurant asset. Improvements to leased properties are depreciated over the shorter of their useful life or the lease term, which includes a fixed, non-cancelable lease term plus any reasonably assured renewal periods. See Note 6 for additional information.
(i)
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
Property and equipment and finite-life intangible assets are reviewed for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company’s assessment of recoverability of property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets is performed at the component level, which is generally an individual restaurant and requires judgment and an estimate of future restaurant generated cash flows. The Company’s estimates of fair values are based on the best information available and require the use of estimates, judgments, and projections.
 The Company did 
no
t record any impairment losses on long-lived assets in fiscal years 2024, 2023, or 2022.
F-9
(j)
Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of goodwill and trademarks, which are not subject to amortization. We generally record goodwill in connection with the acquisition of restaurants from franchisees. On an annual basis (October 1
st
 of each fiscal year) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable, the Company reviews the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
No
 indications of impairment were identified during fiscal years 2024, 2023, or 2022.
It is possible that changes in circumstances or changes in management’s judgments, assumptions, and estimates could result in an impairment charge of a portion or all of its goodwill or other intangible assets.
(k)
Foreign Currency Translation
The foreign currency translation adjustment included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income represents the unrealized impact of translating our foreign investment. This amount is not included in Net income and would only be realized upon disposition of our investment. The related Accumulated other comprehensive loss is presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
(l)
Revenue Recognition
Revenues consist primarily of royalties, national advertising fund (the "Ad Fund") contributions (advertising fees), initial and renewal franchise fees, and upfront fees from development agreements and international territory agreements. The Company's performance obligations under its franchise agreements consist of (a) a franchise license, (b) pre-opening services, such as training, and (c) ongoing services, such as management of the Ad Fund contributions, development of training materials and menu items, and restaurant monitoring. These performance obligations are highly interrelated, so they are not considered to be individually distinct and therefore are accounted for as a single performance obligation, which is satisfied by providing a right to use the Company's intellectual property over the term of each franchise agreement. Franchise fee, development fee and international territory fee payments received by the Company before the restaurant opens are recorded as deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Royalties, including franchisee contributions to the Ad Fund, are calculated as a percentage of franchise restaurant sales over the term of the franchise agreement. Initial and renewal franchise fees are payable by the franchisee prior to the restaurant opening or at the time of a renewal of an existing franchise agreement. The Company's franchise agreement royalties, inclusive of Ad Fund contributions, represent sales-based royalties that are related entirely to the Company's performance obligation under the franchise agreement and are recognized as franchised restaurant sales occur, payable weekly. Additionally, initial and renewal franchise fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective agreement. The Company's performance obligation under development agreements and international territory agreements generally consists of an obligation to grant exclusive development rights over a stated term. These development rights are not distinct from franchise agreements, so upfront fees paid by franchisees for development rights are apportioned to each franchised restaurant opened and accounted for as an initial franchise fee. 
The Company records food and beverage revenues from company-owned restaurants upon sale to the customer. The Company collects and remits sales, food and beverage, alcoholic beverage, and hospitality taxes on transactions with customers and reports such amounts under the net method in its Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Accordingly, these taxes are not included in gross revenue. 
The Company records a liability in the period in which a gift card is sold. As gift cards are redeemed, the liability is reduced. When gift cards are redeemed at a franchisee-operated restaurant, the revenue and related administrative costs are recognized by the franchisee. The Company recognizes revenue and related administrative costs when gift cards are redeemed at company-owned restaurants.

(m)
Consideration from Vendors
The Company has entered into food and beverage supply agreements with certain major vendors. Pursuant to the terms of these arrangements, rebates are provided to the Company from the vendors based upon the dollar volume of purchases for company-owned restaurants and franchised restaurants. These incentives are recognized as earned throughout the year and are classified as a reduction in Cost of sales with any consideration received in excess of the total expense of the vendor’s products included within Royalty revenue, franchise fees and other within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
 The incentives recognized were approximately $
25.3
 million, $
17.7
 million, and $
13.1
 million, during fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, 
F-10
respectively, of which $
3.1
 million, $
2.3
 million, and $
1.8
 million was classified as a reduction in Cost of sales during fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
(n)
Advertising Expenses
The Company administers the Ad Fund, for which a percentage of gross sales is collected from domestic restaurant franchisees and company-owned restaurants to be used for various forms of advertising for the Wingstop brand. Effective the first day of the fiscal second quarter of 2024, domestic franchisees’ contribution rates to the national advertising fund increased to 
5.3
%, up from 
5
%, of gross sales. The national advertising fund contribution rate was 
5
% for fiscal year 2023.
The Company administers and directs the development of all advertising and promotion programs in the Ad Fund for which it collects advertising contributions in accordance with the provisions of its franchise agreements. The Company has a contractual obligation with regard to these advertising contributions. The Company consolidates and reports all assets and liabilities of the Ad Fund as restricted assets of the Ad Fund and liabilities of the Ad Fund within current assets and current liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 28, 2024, the restricted assets and liabilities of the Ad Fund consisted of $
23.7
 million of cash and cash equivalents, $
9.0
 million of accounts receivable, $
15.3
 million of accrued expenses, and $
17.3
 million of accounts payable. As of December 30, 2023, the restricted assets and liabilities of the Ad Fund consisted of $
18.8
 million of cash and cash equivalents, $
6.6
 million of accounts receivable, $
17.2
 million of accrued expenses, and $
8.1
 million of accounts payable.
Pursuant to the Company’s franchise agreements, use of Ad Fund contributions is restricted to advertising, public relations, merchandising, similar activities, and administrative expenses to increase sales and further enhance the public reputation of the Wingstop brand. The aforementioned administrative expenses may also include personnel expenses and allocated costs incurred by the Company that are directly associated with administering the Ad Fund, as outlined in the provisions of the applicable franchise agreements.
The Company expenses the production costs of advertising in the period in which the advertising first occurs. All other advertising and promotional costs are expensed in the period incurred. When contributions to the Ad Fund exceed the related advertising expenses, advertising costs are accrued up to the amount of the related contributions. Ad Fund contributions and expenditures are reported on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Advertising expenses incurred by company-owned restaurants are included within Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Company-owned restaurants incurred advertising expenses of $
6.3
 million, $
4.9
 million, and $
3.6
 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
(o)
Leases
The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at inception and leases restaurants and office space under operating leases. Most lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances, rent holidays, rent escalation clauses, and/or contingent rent provisions. For leases with renewal periods at the Company’s option, the Company determines the expected lease period based on whether the renewal of any options are reasonably certain at the inception of the lease. For purposes of measurement and amortization of the right-of-use asset and associated lease liability over the terms of the leases, the Company uses the date it takes possession of the leased space for construction purposes at the beginning of the lease term, which is generally 
two
 to 
three months
 prior to a restaurant’s opening date. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available on the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company has lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components which are not separated. Certain leases require the Company to pay a portion of real estate taxes, utilities, building operating expenses, insurance, and other charges in addition to rent.
(p)
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company measures stock-based compensation cost at fair value on the date of grant for all share-based awards and recognizes compensation expense over the service period that the awards are expected to vest. The Company has elected to recognize compensation cost for graded-vesting awards subject only to a service condition over the requisite service period of the entire award. For performance awards, the Company recognizes expense in the period in which vesting becomes probable. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.

(q)
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities as well as tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the change. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return including all of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Judgment is required in evaluating the Company’s uncertain tax positions and determining the Company’s income tax expense. The Company assesses the income tax position and records the liabilities for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date.

Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities convertible into, or other contracts to issue, common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. For the calculation of diluted earnings per share, the basic weighted average number of shares is increased by the dilutive effect of the exercise and vesting of stock options and service-based and performance-based restricted stock units, respectively, determined using the treasury stock method.

Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. Assets and liabilities are classified using a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value as follows:
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.
Level 2 - Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs corroborated by market data.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs reflecting management’s estimates and assumptions.
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. 
Fair value of debt is determined on a non-recurring basis, which results are summarized as follows (in thousands):

The Company had a state net operating loss carry-forward of $
23.3
 million at December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023. The state net operating loss carry forwards begin to expire in 2030.
F-18
The Company had a valuation allowance of $
0.6
 million against its deferred tax assets as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023. In assessing whether a deferred tax asset will be realized, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that either some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company considers the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, the Company believes it is more likely than not that it will realize a portion of the benefits of the federal and state deductible differences. 
The Company files income tax returns, which are periodically audited by various federal and state jurisdictions. The Company's income tax returns prior to tax year 2018 are generally considered closed to examination by the applicable tax authorities. In fiscal year 2024, the Internal Revenue Service commenced an examination of the Company’s U.S. income tax return for fiscal year 2021.

Securitized Financing Facility
On December 3, 2024, the Company completed a securitized financing transaction, in which Wingstop Funding LLC, a limited purpose, bankruptcy-remote, indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Issuer”), issued $
500
 million of its Series 2024-1 
5.858
% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2 (the “2024 Class A-2 Notes”). The Issuer also increased the capacity of its revolving financing facility of Series 2022-1 Variable Funding Senior Notes, Class A-1 (the “Variable Funding Notes”) from $
200
 million to $
300
 million. Following the increase, borrowing capacity under the Variable Funding Notes permits borrowings of up to a maximum principal amount of $
300
 million, a portion may be used to issue letters of credits. The 2024 Class A-2 Notes and the Variable Funding Notes are referred to collectively as the “2024 Notes.” The proceeds from the securitized financing transaction were used to pay related transaction fees and expenses, strengthen the Company's liquidity position and for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of shares of the Company’s common stock.
In addition to the 2024 Notes, the Company’s outstanding debt consists of its existing Series 2022-1 
3.734
% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2 (the “2022 Notes”) and Series 2020-1 
2.84
% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2 (the “2020 Notes”), which have an anticipated repayment date of March 2029 and December 2027, respectively. 
No
 borrowings were outstanding under the Variable Funding Notes as of December 28, 2024.
The 2024 Notes were issued in a securitization transaction, which is guaranteed by certain limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company and secured by a security interest in substantially all of their assets, including certain domestic and foreign revenue-generating assets, consisting principally of franchise-related agreements, intellectual property, and vendor rebate contracts.
The 2024 Notes were issued pursuant to a second amended and restated base indenture and related supplemental indentures (collectively, the “Indenture”). Interest and principal payments on the 2024 Class A-2 Notes are payable on a quarterly basis. The requirement to make such quarterly principal payments on the 2024 Class A-2 Notes is subject to certain financial conditions set forth in the Indenture. The legal final maturity date of the 2024 Notes is in December of 2054, but, unless earlier prepaid to the extent permitted under the Indenture, the anticipated repayment date of the 2024 Class A-2 Notes is December 2031. If the Issuer has not repaid or refinanced the 2024 Class A-2 Notes prior
 to the anticipated repayment date, additional interest will accrue on the 2024 Notes.
The Variable Funding Notes accrue interest at a variable rate based on (i) the prime rate, (ii) the overnight federal funds rates, (iii) the secured overnight financing rate, or (iv) with respect to advances made by conduit investors, the weighted average cost of, or related to, the issuance of commercial paper allocated to fund or maintain such advances, in each case plus any applicable 
F-20
margin, as more fully set forth in the 2024 Variable Funding Note Purchase Agreement, dated December 3, 2024, and the indenture supplement. 
Commitment fees and other usage fees apply to the Variable Funding Notes facility depending on the type of borrowing requested. There is a 
60
-basis points draw fee on borrowings requested pursuant to the terms of the Variable Fund Notes. Additionally, during a commitment availability period, there is a 
30
-basis point commitment fee on the committed portion of the Variable Funding Notes.
The 2020 Notes, 2022 Notes, and the 2024 Notes (together, the “Notes”) are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments in the case of the Notes under certain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, that the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective, and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information, and similar matters. The Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated debt service coverage ratios, the sum of global gross sales for specified restaurants being below certain levels on certain measurement dates, certain change of control and manager termination events, an event of default, and the failure to repay or refinance the Notes on the applicable scheduled maturity date. The Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal or other amounts due on or with respect to the Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective, and certain judgments. As of December 28, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.
During the first quarter of 2022, as a result of the termination of the 2020 variable funding note facility, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $
0.8
 million related to the write-off of previously capitalized financing costs. Total debt issuance costs incurred and capitalized in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes were $
5.5
 million.
As of December 28, 2024, the Company’s leverage ratio under the 2020 Class A-2 Notes, the 2022 Class A-2 Notes, and the 2024 Class A-2 Notes was less than 
5.0
x. Per the terms of the Company’s debt agreements, principal payments can be suspended at the borrower’s election until the repayment date as long as the Company maintains a leverage ratio of less than 
5.0
x. Accordingly, the Company elected to suspend payments following the principal payment made in the second quarter of 2023, and the entire outstanding balance of the 2020 Class A-2 Notes, the 2022 Class A-2 Notes, and the 2024 Class A-2 Notes has been classified as long-term debt due after fiscal year 2026. The 2020 Class A-2 Notes, the 2022 Class A-2 Notes, and the 2024 Class A-2 Notes are generally subject to 
1
% annual amortization.

Leases
The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company has operating leases for retail store locations, office space, and equipment. The Company's leases have remaining terms of 
0.9
 years to 
13.2
 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to 
ten years
. Lease terms may include options to renew when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
As most of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available on the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company has lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance).
During the fiscal first quarter 2024, the Company executed a lease for an office building, which commenced in May 2024. The operating lease has an initial lease term of 
13.8
 years with undiscounted fixed payments of $
66.9
 million in the aggregate over the initial term.

Commitments and Contingencies
The Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims, and liabilities, such as employment-related claims and other cases, which arise in the ordinary course of business and are generally covered by insurance. In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to those actions should not have a material adverse impact on financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Employee Benefit Plan
The Company sponsors a 401(k) profit sharing plan for all employees who are eligible based upon age and length of service. The Company made matching contributions of approximately $

0.9
 million for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation
In May 2024, the Company’s stockholders approved the adoption of the 2024 Omnibus Award Plan (the “2024 Plan”). All equity grants subject to FASB ASC Topic 718 after the date of approval are made under the 2024 Plan. No further equity grants after that date are permitted under the 2015 Omnibus Award Plan (as amended, the “2015 Plan”). The 2024 Plan is currently the only equity plan from which future equity awards may be granted, but outstanding awards granted under the 2015 Plan will continue to be governed by the terms of the 2015 Plan and the underlying award agreement. The 2024 Plan provides for the grant or award of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance unit awards, performance share awards, cash-based awards and other stock-based awards to employees, directors, and other eligible persons. Stock options issued under the 2024 Plan expire 
ten years
 from the date of the grant. As of December 28, 2024, there were approximately 
1.8
 million shares available for future grants under the 2024 Plan. 
In the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined in the 2024 Plan) in connection with which the board of directors or the Compensation Committee of the board of directors determines prior to such change in control that outstanding awards will be honored or assumed or new rights substituted therefore (as required by the Plan), each outstanding award will continue to vest in accordance with its terms. In the event the outstanding awards are not assumed or new rights substituted therefore in connection with the transaction, the awards will become fully vested and, to the extent applicable, exercisable immediately prior to the change in control and shall be exchanged for cash. 
Stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the requisite employee service period. The Company recognized approximately $
22.1
 million, $
15.6
 million, and $
4.2
 million in stock compensation expense, net of forfeitures, for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in-capital. The Company recognized forfeitures of $
0.8
 million and $
1.3
 million for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. Stock compensation expense is included in Selling, general and administrative in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Assumptions made regarding forfeitures in determining the remaining unamortized share-based compensation are re-evaluated periodically.

Performance Stock Units
Performance stock units (“PSUs”) represent a right to receive a certain number of shares of common stock based on the achievement of company performance goals and continued employment during the vesting period. Performance stock units cliff-vest at the end of a 
three year
 service period or vest in equal annual amounts over a 
three year
 period. Vested amounts may range from 
0
% to a maximum of 
250
% of targeted amounts depending on the achievement of performance measures at the end of each vesting period. Such performance measures are based on the Company meeting net new restaurant targets, return on incremental investment targets, or sales targets for the vesting period. The fair value of PSUs is based on the closing price on the date of grant. The compensation expense related to these PSUs is recognized over the vesting period when the achievement of the performance conditions becomes probable. The total compensation cost for the PSUs is determined based on the most likely outcome of the performance condition and the number of awards expected to vest.

Restaurant Transactions
During fiscal year 2024, the Company completed the sale of 
seven
 company-owned restaurants in the New York market to a franchisee for aggregate proceeds of $
4.0
 million. In connection with the sale of the restaurants, the Company recorded a $
1.0
 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the related assets and liabilities, which was net of $
31,000
 reduction in goodwill. The net gain on these restaurant sales was recorded in Gain on sale of restaurants and other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as of December 28, 2024. 
The Company acquired 
four
 restaurants from franchisees during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, and 
three
 restaurants from franchisees during each of the fiscal years ended December 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The total purchase prices are reflected in the table below and were all funded by cash flows from operations.
The following table summarizes the allocations of the purchase prices to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of these acquisitions (in thousands):

The results of operations of these restaurants are included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income since the date of acquisition. The acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations. 
The excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair value of assets acquired was allocated to goodwill and is attributable to the benefits expected as a result of the acquisition, including sales and growth opportunities. All of the goodwill from the acquisitions is expected to be deductible for federal income tax purposes.
Pro-forma financial information of the combined entities is not presented due to the immaterial impact of the financial results of the acquired restaurants on our consolidated financial statements.
The fair value measurement of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date is based on significant inputs not observed in the market and thus represents a Level 3 fair value measurement. Fair value measurements for reacquired 
F-25
franchise rights were determined using the income approach. Fair value measurements for property and equipment were determined using the cost approach.

Franchise fee, development fee, and international territory fee payments received by the Company are recorded as deferred revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which represents a contract liability. Deferred revenue is reduced as fees are recognized in revenue over the term of the franchise license for the respective restaurant. As the term of the franchise license is typically 
ten years
, substantially all of the franchise fee revenue recognized in the current fiscal year was included in the deferred revenue balance as of December 30, 2023. Approximately $
13.5
 million and $
9.3
 million of deferred revenue as of December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, relates to restaurants that were not yet opened, so the fees are not yet being amortized. The weighted average remaining amortization period for deferred franchise and renewal fees related to open restaurants is 
7.2
 years. The Company did not have any material contract assets as of December 28, 2024.

Segment Information
In accordance with Segment Reporting, the Company uses the management approach for determining its reportable segments. The management approach is based upon the way that management reviews performance and allocates resources. 
The Company has 
one
 reportable segment: restaurants. The restaurant segment sells food and beverage through its company-owned restaurants as well as collects royalties, franchise fees, and Ad Fund contributions from franchised restaurants. The restaurant segment derives revenue from both company-owned and franchised restaurants domestically and from franchised restaurants across 
11
 international countries and territories. The Company manages the business activities on a consolidated basis, as Wingstop restaurants all have similar customers, sell similar products, and have a similar process to sell those products. The measure of restaurant segment assets is reported as Total assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accounting policies of the restaurant segment are the same as those described in Note 1.
The Company’s chief operating decision-maker (the “CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company measures segment profit using consolidated net income. The CODM uses consolidated net income in deciding whether to reinvest profits into the restaurant segment or into other parts of the Company, such as for acquisitions, share repurchases or to pay dividends. Components of consolidated net income, including SG&A, are used to monitor budget versus actual results in assessing performance of the segment.
