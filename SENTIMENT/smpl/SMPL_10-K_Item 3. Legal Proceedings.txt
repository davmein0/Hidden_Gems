Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding the Company’s expectation for future performance, liquidity and capital resources that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s expectations. The Company’s actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include those identified below and those described in “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” and in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Report. The Company assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.
Our fiscal year ends the last Saturday in August. Our fiscal year 2025 ended August 30, 2025, was a fifty-two week period. Our fiscal years 2024 and 2023 ended August 31, 2024, and August 26, 2023, were a fifty-three week period and a fifty-two week period, respectively. Our fiscal quarters are comprised of thirteen weeks each, except for fifty-three week fiscal periods for which the fourth quarter is comprised of fourteen weeks, and end on the thirteenth Saturday of each quarter (fourteenth Saturday of the fourth quarter, when applicable). Our fiscal quarters for fiscal 2025 ended on November 30, 2024, March 1, 2025, May 31, 2025, and August 30, 2025.
Unless the context requires otherwise in this Report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” and “Simply Good Foods” refer to The Simply Good Foods Company and its subsidiaries. In context, “Quest” may also refer to the Quest brand, “Atkins” may also refer to the Atkins brand, and “OWYN” may also refer to the OWYN brand. Atkins, Quest, OWYN, and the Simply Good logo are either registered trademarks or trademarks of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary Simply Good Foods USA, Inc. or one of its affiliates in the United States and elsewhere. All rights are reserved.
Overview
The Simply Good Foods Company is a consumer packaged food and beverage company that aims to lead the nutritious snacking movement with trusted brands that offer a variety of convenient, innovative, great-tasting, better-for-you snacks and meal replacements, and other product offerings. The product portfolio we develop, market and sell consists primarily of protein bars, ready-to-drink (“RTD”) shakes, sweet and salty snacks and confectionery products marketed under the Quest, Atkins, and OWYN brand names. We believe Simply Good Foods is poised to expand its wellness platform through innovation and organic growth along with acquisition opportunities.
To that end, in June 2024, we completed the acquisition of Only What You Need, Inc., a plant-based protein food company, for a cash purchase price of approximately $281.9 million (subject to customary adjustments). For more information, please see “
Liquidity and Capital Resources-OWYN Acquisition
”.
Our nutritious snacking platform consists of brands that specialize in providing products for consumers that follow certain nutritional philosophies and health-and-wellness trends: Quest for consumers seeking a variety of protein-rich foods and beverages that also limit sugars and simple carbs, Atkins for those following a low-carb lifestyle, and OWYN for those looking for a plant-based food and beverage option. We distribute our products in major retail channels, primarily in North America, including grocery, club, and mass merchandise, as well as through e-commerce, convenience, specialty, and other channels. Our portfolio of nutritious snacking brands gives us a strong platform with which to introduce new products, expand distribution, and attract new consumers to our products.
Business Trends
Our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal year ended August 30, 2025, were primarily driven by Quest and OWYN volume growth, which more than offset continued declines in Atkins driven primarily by a reduction of distribution. In recent periods, retail distribution for the Atkins brand has been under pressure, driving net sales declines for the brand that have been partially offset by growth in the e-commerce channel. The Atkins brand has had, and continues to have, a large retail presence on-shelf, which is being reduced in fiscal year 2026 and could be reduced in future periods. In response, in fiscal year 2026, we are taking actions to bolster the highest performing Atkins products and simultaneously working with retailers to replace lower performing Atkins products with higher performing Quest and OWYN products.
The Company’s gross margin was affected by the unfavorable effects of higher commodity expenses compared to the prior year. We continue to monitor macroeconomic trends and uncertainties such as consumer and economic uncertainty, key ingredient inflation, supply chain challenges, and the effects of tariffs, which may have adverse effects on net sales and profitability. We are continuing to evaluate these factors and our ability to potentially offset all or a portion of cost increases through pricing actions and cost savings efforts for fiscal year 2026. Economic pressures on customers and consumers, including the challenges of high inflation and the effects of tariffs, may negatively affect our net sales and profitability in the future.
Please also see the information under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for additional information regarding the risks of inflation, higher raw material, packaging, co-manufacturing, and logistics costs, and supply chain challenges.

Our Reportable Segment
Following the OWYN Acquisition during the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, the Company determined its operations are organized into two operating segments, Quest and Atkins, and OWYN, due to similar financial, economic and operating characteristics. The operating segments are also similar in the following areas: (a) the nature of the products; (b) the nature of the production processes; (c) the methods used to distribute products to customers, (d) the type of customer for the products, and (e) the nature of the regulatory environment. The Company also designed its organizational structure to support entity-wide business functions across brands, products, customers, and geographic regions. As a result, as of the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, and fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, the Company determined its operations are organized into two operating segments, which were aggregated into one reportable segment due to similar financial, economic and operating characteristics. As of the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2023, the Company determined its operations were organized into one consolidated operating segment and reportable segment.
Key Financial Definitions
Net sales. 
Net sales consist primarily of product sales less the cost of promotional activities, slotting fees and other sales credits and adjustments, including product returns.
Cost of goods sold. 
Cost of goods sold consists primarily of the costs we pay to our contract manufacturing partners to produce the products sold. These costs include the purchase of raw ingredients, packaging, shipping and handling, warehousing, depreciation of warehouse equipment, and a tolling charge payable to the contract manufacturer. Cost of goods sold includes products provided at no charge as part of promotions and the non-food materials provided with customer orders.
Operating expenses. 
Operating expenses consist primarily of selling and marketing, general and administrative, depreciation and amortization, business transaction costs, and loss on impairment. The following is a brief description of the components of operating expenses:
•
Selling and marketing.
 Selling and marketing expenses comprise broker commissions, consumer marketing, media and other marketing costs.
•
General and administrative.
 General and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support our business, including employee compensation, stock-based compensation, professional services, executive transition costs, integration expense, restructuring costs, insurance and other general corporate expenses.
•
Depreciation and amortization.
 Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of expenses associated with the depreciation of fixed assets and capitalized leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets.
•
Business Transaction Costs.
 Business transaction costs are comprised of transaction advisory fees, non-deferrable debt issuance costs, legal, due diligence, consulting, and accounting expenses associated with the OWYN Acquisition.
•
Loss on impairment.
 Loss on impairment is comprised of impairment charges related to our brand and trademarks indefinite-lived intangible asset and our licensing agreements finite-lived intangible asset.
Results of Operations
During the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, our net sales increased $119.6 million, or 9.0%, to $1,450.9 million compared to net sales of $1,331.3 million for the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, driven by Quest and OWYN volume growth, which more than offset continued declines in Atkins driven primarily by a reduction of distribution. Gross profit increased, driven by higher sales volumes, while gross profit margin decreased primarily as a result of unfavorable commodity expenses compared to the prior period and lower gross profit margins of the OWYN business. We expect to continue building on our existing capabilities and strengthening the position of our brands in the marketplace, and will continue to invest in our business and improve our operating efficiencies.
In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a number of key performance indicators used by management and typically used by our competitors, including the non-GAAP measures EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. See “Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA” below for a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income for each applicable period.
A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, compared to the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, compared to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2023, can be found under Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on October 29, 2024.

    Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial metric. See below for a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for each applicable period. 
Net sales.
 Net sales of $1,450.9 million represented an increase of $119.6 million, or 9.0%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, compared to the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024. The increase in net sales was primarily driven by Quest and OWYN volume growth, which more than offset continued declines in Atkins driven primarily by a reduction of distribution.
Cost of goods sold.
 Cost of goods sold increased $105.4 million, or 12.9%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, compared to the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024. The cost of goods sold increase was primarily driven by higher sales volumes, primarily as a result of the growth for Quest and OWYN.
Gross profit. 
Gross profit of $525.7 million increased $14.2 million, or 2.8%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, compared to the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 36.2% for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, a decrease of 220 basis points from 38.4% of net sales for the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily driven by unfavorable commodity expenses compared to the prior year period and lower gross profit margins of the OWYN business.
Operating expenses. 
Operating expenses increased $63.8 million, or 20.9%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, compared to the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, due to the following:
40
•
Selling and marketing
. Selling and marketing expenses decreased $9.6 million, or 6.7%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, compared to the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily related to an overall decrease in marketing spend.
•
General and administrative
. General and administrative expenses increased $26.2 million, or 20.2%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, compared to the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $20.3 million in integration expenses related to the OWYN Acquisition, an increase of $8.0 million in employee-related costs, and higher corporate expenses and other costs, partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation of $3.1 million.
•
Depreciation and amortization
. Depreciation and amortization expenses were $16.9 million for both the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, and the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024.
•
Business transaction costs. 
Business transaction costs were $0.8 million for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, compared to $14.5 million for the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, and were comprised of expenses related to the OWYN Acquisition.
•
Loss on impairment
. Loss on impairment charges were $60.9 million for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025. Refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Intangibles, for additional information regarding the Company’s impairment assessments.
Interest income.
 Interest income decreased $1.6 million or 38.2% to $2.7 million for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, compared to $4.3 million of interest income for the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, primarily due to lower cash balances and the decrease in interest rates.
Interest expense. 
Interest expense decreased $2.8 million for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, compared to the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, primarily due to the effect of principal payments reducing the outstanding balance of the Term Facility (as defined below) during the fiscal year. Additionally, interest expense related to the amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount decreased $0.6 million for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, compared to the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024.
(Loss) gain on foreign currency transactions.
 Foreign currency transactions resulted in an immaterial loss and an immaterial gain for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, and August 31, 2024, respectively. 
Income tax expense. 
Income tax expense decreased $14.5 million for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, compared to the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024. The decrease in our income tax expense is primarily driven by lower income from operations and changes in permanent differences.
Net income.
 Net income was $103.6 million for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, a decrease of $35.7 million, compared to net income of $139.3 million for the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024. The decrease was driven by higher operating expenses, primarily the loss on impairment, and was partially offset by higher gross profit and lower interest expense.
Adjusted EBITDA. 
Adjusted EBITDA increased $9.0 million, or 3.4%, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, compared to the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, driven primarily by higher gross profit. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, see “Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA” below.
41
Reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as alternatives to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as alternatives to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (each as determined in accordance with GAAP). Simply Good Foods defines EBITDA as net income or loss before interest income, interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA as further adjusted to exclude the following items: loss on impairment, stock-based compensation expense, executive transition costs, business transaction costs, inventory step-up, integration expenses, term loan transaction fees, and other non-core expenses. The Company believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, when used in conjunction with net income, are useful to provide additional information to investors. Management of the Company uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to supplement net income because these measures reflect operating results of the on-going operations, eliminate items that are not directly attributable to the Company’s underlying operating performance, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to the key metrics the Company’s management uses in its financial and operational decision making. The Company also believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in its industry. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in the non-GAAP calculation.
The following unaudited table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, and fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024:

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
We have historically funded our operations with cash flow from operations and, when needed, with borrowings under our Credit Agreement (as defined below). Our principal uses of cash have been working capital, debt service, repurchases of our common stock, and acquisition opportunities.
We had $98.5 million in cash as of August 30, 2025. We believe our sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations, growth strategy and additional expenses we expect to incur for at least the next twelve months. As circumstances warrant, we may issue debt and/or equity securities from time to time on an opportunistic basis, dependent upon market conditions and available pricing. We make no assurance that we can issue and sell such securities on acceptable terms or at all.
Our material future cash requirements from contractual and other obligations relate primarily to our principal and interest payments for our Term Facility, as defined and discussed below, and our operating leases. Refer to Note 7, Long-Term Debt and Line of Credit, and Note 10, Leases, of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information related to the expected timing and amount of payments related to our contractual and other obligations.
Debt and Credit Facilities
On July 7, 2017, the Company (through certain of its subsidiaries) entered into a credit agreement with Barclays Bank PLC and other parties (as amended to date, the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement at that time provided for (i) a term facility of $200.0 million (“Term Facility”) with a seven-year maturity and (ii) a revolving credit facility of up to $75.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with a five-year maturity. Substantially concurrent with the consummation of the business combination which formed the Company between Conyers Park Acquisition Corp. and NCP-ATK Holdings, Inc. on July 7, 2017, the full $200.0 million of the Term Facility (the “Term Loan”) was drawn.
On November 7, 2019, we entered into a second amendment (the “Incremental Facility Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to increase the principal borrowed on the Term Facility by $460.0 million. The Term Facility together with the incremental borrowing make up the Initial Term Loans (as defined in the Incremental Facility Amendment). The Incremental Facility Amendment was executed to partially finance the acquisition of Quest Nutrition, LLC on November 7, 2019. No amounts under the Term Facility were repaid as a result of the execution of the Incremental Facility Amendment.
Effective as of December 16, 2021, we entered into a third amendment (the “Extension Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. The Extension Amendment provided for an extension of the stated maturity date of the Revolving Commitments and Revolving Loans (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) from July 7, 2022, to the earlier of (i) 91 days prior to the then-effective maturity date of the Initial Term Loans and (ii) December 16, 2026.
On January 21, 2022, we entered into the “2022 Repricing Amendment” to the Credit Agreement. The 2022 Repricing Amendment, among other things, (i) reduced the interest rate per annum applicable to the Initial Term Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement immediately prior to the effective date of the 2022 Repricing Amendment, (ii) reset the prepayment premium for the existing Initial Term Loans to apply to Repricing Transactions (as defined in the Credit Agreement) that occur within six months after the effective date of the 2022 Repricing Amendment, and (iii) implemented SOFR and related replacement provisions for LIBOR.
On April 25, 2023, the Company entered into the “2023 Repricing Amendment” to the Credit Agreement. The 2023 Repricing Amendment, (i) reduced the interest rate per annum applicable to the Initial Term Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement immediately prior to April 25, 2023, and (ii) provided for an extension of the maturity date of the Initial Term Loans from July 7, 2024, to March 17, 2027.
On June 13, 2024, the Company entered into a sixth amendment (the “2024 Incremental Facility Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to increase the principal borrowed on the Term Facility by $250.0 million. The terms of the incremental borrowing are the same as the terms of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Facility. The 2024 Incremental Facility Amendment was executed to partially finance the OWYN Acquisition. No amounts under the Term Facility were repaid as a result of the execution of the 2024 Incremental Facility Amendment.
On January 31, 2025, the Company entered into a seventh amendment (the “2025 Repricing Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to reduce the interest rate per annum applicable to the Initial Term Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement immediately prior to the effective date of the 2025 Repricing Amendment. 
Effective as of the 2025 Repricing Amendment, the interest rate per annum for the Initial Term Loans is based on either:
43
i.
A base rate equaling the higher of (a) the “prime rate,” (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, or (c) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) applicable for an interest period of one month plus 1.00% plus (x) 1.00% margin for the Term Loan or (y) 2.00% margin for the Revolving Credit Facility; or
ii.
SOFR subject to a floor of 0.50%, plus (x) 2.00% margin for the Term Loan or (y) 3.00% margin for the Revolving Credit Facility.
In connection with the closing of the 2025 Repricing Amendment, the Company expensed $0.7 million of non-deferrable third-party costs through 
General and administrative
 expenses within the

Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.
The Simply Good Foods Company is not a borrower under the Credit Agreement and has not provided a guarantee of the Credit Agreement. Simply Good Foods USA, Inc., is the administrative borrower and certain other subsidiary holding companies are co-borrowers under the Credit Agreement. Each of our domestic subsidiaries that is not a named borrower under the Credit Agreement has provided a guarantee on a secured basis. As security for the payment or performance of the debt under the Credit Agreement, the borrowers and the guarantors have pledged certain equity interests in their respective subsidiaries and granted the lenders a security interest in substantially all of their domestic assets. All guarantors other than Quest Nutrition, LLC and Only What You Need, Inc. are holding companies with no assets other than their investments in their respective subsidiaries.
The Credit Agreement contains certain financial and other covenants that limit our ability to, among other things, incur and/or undertake asset sales and other dispositions, liens, indebtedness, certain acquisitions and investments, consolidations, mergers, reorganizations and other fundamental changes, payment of dividends and other distributions to equity and warrant holders, and prepayments of material subordinated debt, in each case, subject to customary exceptions materially consistent with credit facilities of such type and size. The Revolving Credit Facility has a maximum total net leverage ratio equal to or less than 6.00:1.00 contingent on credit extensions in excess of 30% of the total amount of commitments available under the Revolving Credit Facility. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit facilities may result in an event of default. We were in compliance with all financial covenants as of August 30, 2025, and August 31, 2024, respectively.
As of August 30, 2025, the outstanding balance of the Term Facility was $250.0 million. We are not required to make principal payments on the Term Facility over the twelve months following the period ended August 30, 2025. The outstanding balance of the Term Facility is due upon its maturity in March 2027. As of August 30, 2025, there were no amounts drawn against the Revolving Credit Facility.
OWYN Acquisition
On April 29, 2024, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Simply Good Foods, USA, Inc. entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) to acquire Only What You Need, Inc. (“OWYN”), a plant-based protein food company (the “OWYN Acquisition”), for approximately $280.0 million. On June 13, 2024, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the OWYN Acquisition by acquiring 100% of the equity interests for a cash purchase price at closing of $281.9 million, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments. We acquired OWYN as a part of our vision to lead the nutritious snacking movement with trusted brands that offer a variety of convenient, innovative, great-tasting, better-for-you snacks and meal replacements that will now offer plant-based products to a wider market of consumers.
The OWYN Acquisition was funded through a combination of incremental borrowings under our outstanding Term Facility, totaling $250.0 million, and cash on hand. In the second fiscal quarter of 2025, the Company received a post-closing release from escrow of approximately $1.7 million related to net working capital adjustments, resulting in a total net consideration paid of $280.2 million. Business transaction costs within the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, were $0.8 million, which consisted of legal, accounting, and other costs. 
Stock Repurchase Program
On October 21, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved the addition of $50.0 million to our stock repurchase program, resulting in authorized stock repurchases of up to an aggregate of $150.0 million. During the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, the Company repurchased 1,592,471 shares of common stock at an average share price of $31.95. The Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock during the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024. During the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2023, the Company repurchased 546,346 shares of common stock at an average share price of $30.11 per share.
As of August 30, 2025, approximately $20.7 million remained available for repurchases under our $150.0 million stock repurchase program. On October 21, 2025, the Company's Board of Directors approved a $150.0 million increase to its existing stock repurchase program. Refer to Note 12, Stockholders’ Equity, of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information related to our stock repurchase program.

Operating activities. 
Our net cash provided by operating activities decreased $37.2 million to $178.5 million for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, compared to $215.7 million for the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to changes in working capital, comprised of changes in accounts receivable, net, inventories, prepaid expenses, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued interest, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other assets and liabilities, which are driven by the timing of payments and receipts and the building of inventory. Changes in working capital consumed cash of $32.9 million in the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, compared to $19.0 million of cash provided in the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, a difference of $51.9 million. Income from operations decreased by $49.7 million to $156.9 million for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, as compared to $206.5 million for the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024. The decrease was driven by higher operating expenses, primarily the loss on impairment, and was partially offset by higher gross profit.
Investing activities. 
Our net cash used in investing activities was $20.9 million for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, compared to $286.9 million for the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024. Our net cash used in investing activities for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, was primarily comprised of $20.5 million of purchases of property and equipment, primarily at our contract manufacturing facilities. The $286.9 million of net cash used in investing activities for the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, was primarily comprised of the OWYN Acquisition for $280.4 million, and $5.7 million purchases of property and equipment.
Financing activities. 
Our net cash used in financing activities was $191.2 million for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, compared to the net cash provided by financing activities of $115.9 million for the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024. Net cash used in financing activities for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, primarily consisted $150.0 million in principal payments on the Term Facility and $50.9 million in repurchases of common stock, which was offset by $12.9 million in proceeds from option exercises. Net cash provided by financing activities for the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, primarily consisted of $250.0 million of proceeds from the 2024 Incremental Facility Amendment in conjunction with the OWYN Acquisition, partially offset by $135.0 million in principal prepayments on the Term Facility.
Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates
General
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. While the majority of our revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those policies that are reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, which could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of our Consolidated Financial Statements in this filing; however, the following discussion pertains to accounting policies we believe are most critical to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and that require significant, difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Other companies in similar businesses may use different estimation policies and methodologies, which may affect the comparability of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to those of other companies.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with our customer are satisfied. We have determined that fulfilling and delivering products is a single performance obligation. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when we have satisfied our performance obligation and the customer has obtained control of the products. This generally occurs when the product is delivered to or picked up by our customer based on applicable shipping terms, which is typically within 30 days.
45
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for fulfilled product orders, including estimates of variable consideration. The most common forms of variable consideration include trade promotions, such as consumer incentives, coupon redemptions and other marketing activities, allowances for unsaleable product, and any additional amounts where a distinct good or service cannot be identified or the value cannot be reasonably estimated. Estimates of variable consideration are made using various information including historical data on performance of similar trade promotional activities, market data from Circana, and our best estimate of current activity. Revisions can include changes for consideration paid to customers that lack sufficient evidence to support a distinct good or service assertion, or for which a reasonably estimable fair value cannot be determined, primarily related to our assessments of cooperative advertising programs. We review these estimates regularly and make revisions as necessary. Uncertainties related to the estimate of variable consideration are resolved in a short time frame and do not require any additional constraint on variable consideration. Adjustments to variable consideration have historically been insignificant.
Although some payment terms may be longer, the majority of our payment terms are less than 60 days. As a result, we do not have any material significant payments’ terms as payment is received shortly after the time of sale.
While our revenue recognition does not involve significant judgment, it represents a key accounting policy.
Trade Promotions
We offer trade promotions through various programs to customers and consumers. Trade promotions include discounts, rebates, slotting and other marketing activities. Trade promotions are recorded as a reduction to net sales with a corresponding reduction to accounts receivable at the time of revenue recognition for the underlying sale. The recognition of trade promotions requires management to make estimates regarding the volume of incentive that will be redeemed and their total cost. These estimates are made using various information including historical data on the performance of similar trade promotional activities, market data from Circana, and the Company’s best estimates of current activity. Our consolidated financial statements could be materially affected if the actual promotion rates are different from the estimated rates.
As of August 30, 2025, and August 31, 2024, the allowance for trade promotions was $37.8 million and $36.3 million, respectively. Differences between estimated expense and actual redemptions are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period. These differences have historically been insignificant.
Business Combination
On June 13, 2024, we completed the OWYN Acquisition for a cash purchase price of approximately $281.9 million, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments. The OWYN Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), whereby the results of operations, including the revenues and earnings of OWYN, are included in the financial statements from the date of acquisition. Additionally, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at their fair values based on widely accepted valuation techniques in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements, as of the closing date. Significant judgment is required to determine the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets. The process for estimating fair values requires the use of significant estimates, assumptions and judgments, including determining the timing and estimates of future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. ASC 805 establishes a measurement period to provide companies with a reasonable amount of time to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure various items in a business combination and cannot extend beyond one year from the acquisition date. Measurement period adjustments are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined and calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of the acquisition date. In the second fiscal quarter of 2025, a measurement period adjustment of $1.7 million was recorded to goodwill. The final fair value determination of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was completed prior to one year from the transaction completion, consistent with ASC 805.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, comprising our brands and trademarks, are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We conduct our annual impairment tests at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter. We perform our goodwill impairment assessment for each reporting unit that has goodwill. The process of evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis.
For the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, and the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, the Company determined its operations are organized into two operating segments, Quest and Atkins, and OWYN, which are aggregated into one reportable segment due to similar financial, economic and operating characteristics. The operating segments are also similar in the following areas: (a) the nature of the products; (b) the nature of the production processes; (c) the methods used to distribute products to customers, (d) the type of customer for the products, and (e) the nature of the regulatory environment. The Company also designed its organizational structure to support entity-wide business functions across brands, products, customers, and geographic regions. As of the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2023, the Company determined its operations were organized into one consolidated operating segment and reportable segment.
46
We assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets using either a qualitative or quantitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of the reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts. The qualitative assessment evaluates factors including macro-economic conditions, industry-specific and company-specific considerations, legal and regulatory environments, and historical performance. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed. Otherwise, no further assessment is required. The quantitative approach compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, or the indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. The material inputs and assumptions underlying the quantitative assessments of goodwill and intangible impairment are based on operational forecasts derived from expectations of future operating performance, which requires considerable management judgment regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change. Determining the estimated fair value requires multiple Level 3 inputs based on data available at the time of the quantitative assessment including, but not limited to, future revenue projections, discount rates, and royalty rates. Impairment is indicated if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying amount, and an impairment charge is recognized for the differential. 
As of the date of our annual impairment assessment, which is the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter, in fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023, we performed qualitative assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The qualitative assessments did not identify indicators of impairment based on the information available at that time, and it was determined that it was more likely than not each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible had fair values in excess of their carrying values.     
As a result of the declines of future revenue projections during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, the Company conducted an additional qualitative assessment in the fiscal fourth quarter that indicated potential indicators of impairment for the Atkins brand and trademarks indefinite-lived intangible asset. Accordingly, the Company proceeded to conduct a quantitative impairment assessment. Based on our quantitative assessment, the asset had an excess carrying value over its respective fair value, resulting in a loss on impairment. No impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles were recognized in the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, or fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2023. 
We also have intangible assets that have determinable useful lives, consisting primarily of customer relationships, proprietary recipes and formulas, licensing agreements, and software and website development costs. Costs of these finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Finite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicated that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, we identified indicators of impairment related to our licensing agreements finite-lived intangible asset. Accordingly, the Company proceeded to conduct a quantitative impairment assessment. Based on our quantitative assessment, the asset had an excess carrying value over its respective fair value, resulting in a loss on impairment. For the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, and August 26, 2023, we did not identify indicators of impairment related to our finite-lived intangible assets, and as such there were no impairments recorded related to finite-lived intangible assets. We believe the estimates and assumptions utilized in our impairment assessment are reasonable and are comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. However, actual events and results could differ substantially from those utilized in our valuations. Significant declines of future revenue projections or changes of other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus those utilized at the time of the initial valuations could result in further impairment charges that could materially affect the consolidated financial statements.
Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income tax, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. 
Income taxes include federal, state and foreign taxes currently payable and deferred taxes arising from temporary differences between income for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement balances and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the year that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized. Significant management judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate, evaluating tax positions and determining the net realizable value of deferred tax assets.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
Our future income, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates.
Supply chain costs and inflation. 
We are exposed to risks associated with changes in the costs of our raw materials as well as changes to our supply and distribution costs. While inflation, including tariffs, may affect our revenue and cost of products, we believe the effects of inflation on our results of operations and financial condition have not been significant during the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, as compared to prior fiscal periods. While the Company is monitoring key ingredient inflation, which may affect profitability, we believe the Company's strategy and positioning will continue to drive profitable growth for our product offerings and growth within the growing nutritional snacking category. However, there can be no assurance that results of operations and financial condition will not be materially impacted by inflation, including tariffs, in the future. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional discussion of our risks associated with the costs of our raw materials, our supply chain, and inflation.
Interest rate risk. 
We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowing based on a variable interest rate. Derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swap agreements and interest rate cap agreements, while not currently used, may be used for the purpose of managing fluctuating interest rate exposures that exist from our variable rate debt obligations that are expected to remain outstanding. Interest rate changes do not affect the market value of such debt, but could affect the amount of our interest payments, and accordingly, our future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant. As of August 30, 2025, the outstanding balance of the Term Facility was $250.0 million. Based on the amount outstanding of the Term Facility at the end of fiscal year 2025, a 1% increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $2.5 million.
Foreign currency risk. 
We are exposed to changes in currency rates as a result of investments in foreign operations and revenue generated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Revenue and profit generated by international operations will increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Historically, our foreign currency risk has primarily related to our operations in Canada and Australia.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of The Simply Good Foods Company
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Simply Good Foods Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of August 30, 2025, and August 31, 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, and the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 30, 2025, and August 31, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 30, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated October 28, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Revenue Recognition — Trade Promotions — Refer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company offers trade promotions through various programs to customers and consumers. Trade promotions include discounts, rebates, slotting, and other marketing activities. Trade promotions are recorded as a reduction to net sales with a corresponding reduction to accounts receivable at the time of revenue recognition for the underlying sale. The recognition of trade promotions requires the Company to make estimates regarding the volume of incentives that will be redeemed and their total cost. These estimates are made using various information including historical data on performance of similar trade promotional activities, market data from Circana, and the Company's best estimates of current activity.
We identified the allowance for trade promotions related to manufacturer charge-backs as a critical audit matter because management’s estimate of the expected future promotional claims is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. Auditing management’s assumptions and judgments used in determining the allowance for trade promotions related to manufacturer charge-backs as of August 30, 2025, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
50
Our auditing procedures over the allowance for trade promotions related to manufacturer charge-backs included the following, among others:
•
We tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the allowance for trade promotions.
•
For a selection of allowances for trade promotions recorded as of August 30, 2025, we:
◦
Confirmed contract terms directly with the customer.
◦
Agreed contract terms from the accounting records to the promotion agreement with the customer and verified the promotion period was prior to August 30, 2025.
◦
Evaluated the appropriateness of the year-end trade accrual estimate using historical data on performance of similar trade promotional activities and subsequent customer activity.
•
We evaluated management’s ability to estimate promotional claims incurred but not yet received for potential management bias by comparing historical promotional claims received to management’s estimates of the claims to be received.
•
For a selection of customer promotional claims unresolved as of August 30, 2025, we compared that amount to the August 30, 2025, allowance for promotions balance and traced the resolved deduction to an approved trade promotion.
•
For a selection of customer promotional claims resolved after August 30, 2025, we compared that amount to the August 30, 2025, allowance for promotions balance and traced the resolved deduction to an approved trade promotion.
•
For a selection of customers, we performed inquiries with the sales representative responsible for the customer relationship to understand the process for contract negotiation, approval, and monitoring of trade promotions.
Intangible Assets - Atkins Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset - Refer to Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company's evaluation of the Atkins indefinite-lived intangible asset for impairment involves the comparison of its estimated fair value to its carrying amount. During fiscal year 2025, management performed a qualitative assessment in the fiscal fourth quarter that indicated potential indicators of impairment for the Atkins brand and trademarks indefinite-lived intangible asset. Accordingly, the Company proceeded to conduct a quantitative impairment assessment. Based on the quantitative assessment, the asset had an excess carrying value over its respective fair value, resulting in a loss on impairment.
We identified the Company's impairment evaluation of the Atkins indefinite-lived intangible asset as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. A high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of procedures were required to audit management’s assumptions and judgments used to evaluate the reasonableness of the future revenue projections as well as the selection of the royalty rate and the discount rate, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to future revenue projections and the selection of the royalty rate and discount rate for the Atkins indefinite-lived intangible asset included the following, among others:
•
We tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company’s assumptions related to the selection of the future revenue projections, the royalty rate, and the discount rate.
•
We obtained an understanding of management’s key assumptions in developing future revenue projections, the royalty rate, and the discount rate.
•
We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast revenue by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts and forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports for the Company and certain of its industry peers.
•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodologies and the selection of the royalty rate and discount rate by:
◦
Testing the source information underlying the determination of the royalty rate and comparing the royalty rate assumption used by management to peers to develop a range of independent estimates.
◦
Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.
◦
Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.

Nature of Operations and Principles of Consolidation
Description of Business
The Simply Good Foods Company (“Simply Good Foods” or the “Company”) is a consumer packaged food and beverage company that aims to lead the nutritious snacking movement with trusted brands that offer a variety of convenient, innovative, great-tasting, better-for-you snacks and meal replacements, and other product offerings. The product portfolio the Company develops, markets and sells consists primarily of protein bars, ready-to-drink (“RTD”) beverages, sweet and salty snacks and confectionery products marketed under the Quest, Atkins, and OWYN brand names. Simply Good Foods is poised to expand its wellness platform through innovation and organic growth along with acquisition opportunities.
On April 29, 2024, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) to acquire Only What You Need, Inc. (“OWYN”), a plant-based protein food company (the “OWYN Acquisition”), for approximately $
280.0
 million. On June 13, 2024, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the OWYN Acquisition by acquiring 100% of the equity interests for a cash purchase price at closing of $
281.9
 million, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments.
Our nutritious snacking platform consists of brands that specialize in providing products for consumers that follow certain nutritional philosophies and health-and-wellness trends: Quest for consumers seeking a variety of protein-rich foods and beverages that also limit sugars and simple carbohydrates, Atkins for those following a low-carbohydrate lifestyle or seeking to manage weight or blood sugar levels, and OWYN for consumers seeking protein-rich beverages that are plant-based and tested for the top nine allergens that also limit sugars and simple carbohydrates. We distribute our products in major retail channels, primarily in North America, including grocery, club, and mass merchandise, as well as through e-commerce, convenience, specialty, and other channels. Our portfolio of nutritious snacking brands gives us a strong platform with which to introduce new products, expand distribution, and attract new consumers to our products.
The common stock of Simply Good Foods is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “SMPL.”
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”). The Company maintains its accounting records on a 52/53-week fiscal year, ending on the last Saturday in August. 
The financial information presented within the Company’s consolidated financial statements has been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The accompanying financial statements include Consolidated Balance Sheets for the periods ended August 30, 2025, and August 31, 2024. The remaining financial statements include the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, and the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2023.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Unless the context otherwise requires, “we,” “us,” “our” and the “Company” refer to Simply Good Foods and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
2. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Estimates also affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Business Combination
On June 13, 2024, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the OWYN Acquisition by acquiring 100% of the equity interests for a cash purchase price at closing of $
281.9
 million, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments. The OWYN Acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting prescribed by Accounting Standard Codification ("ASC") Topic 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), whereby the results of operations, including the revenues and earnings of OWYN, are included in the financial statements from the date of acquisition. Additionally, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recognized at their fair values based on widely accepted valuation techniques in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements, as of the closing date. The process for 
57
Table of Contents 
estimating fair values requires the use of significant estimates, assumptions and judgments, including determining the timing and estimates of future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. ASC 805 establishes a measurement period to provide the Company with a reasonable amount of time to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure various items in a business combination and cannot extend beyond one year from the acquisition date. The Company completed its final assessment of purchase price allocation for the OWYN Acquisition to the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired at the date of acquisition during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025. Measurement period adjustments were recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustments were determined and calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. Refer to Note 3, Business Combination, for additional information regarding measurement period adjustments.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities are valued based upon observable and non-observable inputs. Valuations using Level 1 inputs are based on unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs utilize significant other observable inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1. Valuations using Level 3 inputs are based on significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and require significant judgment. There were no significant transfers between levels during any period presented.
Cash
Cash
 consists of cash on hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Accounts Receivable, Net and Expected Credit Losses
Accounts receivable, net
 consists primarily of trade receivables, net of allowances for doubtful accounts, returns, and trade promotions. The Company sells its products for cash or on credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices and typically require payment within 30 days of delivery and may allow discounts for early payment. The Company estimates its allowance for doubtful accounts and the related expected credit losses based upon the Company’s historical credit loss experience, adjusted for asset-specific risk characteristics, current economic conditions, and reasonable forecasts. Accounts receivable are written off when determined to be uncollectible.
Charges related to credit losses (recoveries) on accounts receivables from transactions with external customers were approximately $
0.2
 million, $(
0.1
) million, and $
0.7
 million for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, and fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2023, respectively. As of August 30, 2025, and August 31, 2024, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $
0.9
 million and $
0.7
 million, respectively.
Inventories
Inventories 
are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis, adjusted for the value of inventory that is determined to be excess, obsolete, expired or unsaleable. Obsolete inventory is reserved at 
50
% for inventory four to six months from expiration, and 
100
% for items within three months of expiration. Reserves are also taken for certain products or packaging materials when it is determined their cost may not be recoverable.
Inventories, 
as presented with the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is summarized as follows:

Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment, net
 is stated at the allocated fair value for acquired assets. Additions to property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. 
The general ranges of estimated useful lives are:

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement utilizing the straight-line method.
The Company performs impairment tests for 
Property and equipment, net
 when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. There were 
no
 indicators of impairment in the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, or fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2023.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net
Goodwill
 and 
Intangible assets, net
 result primarily from the consummation of the business combination between Conyers Park Acquisition Corp. and NCP-ATK Holdings, Inc. on July 7, 2017, which created the Company, and the acquisitions of Quest and OWYN. 
Intangible assets
 primarily includes brands and trademarks with indefinite lives and customer-related relationships with finite lives. Upon acquisition, the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities, including customer-related intangible assets and trademarks, with any remaining purchase price recorded as 
Goodwill
.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. The Company conducts its annual impairment tests at the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed using either a qualitative or quantitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. The qualitative assessment evaluates factors including macro-economic conditions, industry-specific and company-specific considerations, legal and regulatory environments, and historical performance. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed. Otherwise, no further assessment is required. The quantitative approach compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, or the indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. The material inputs and assumptions underlying the quantitative assessments of goodwill and intangible impairment are based on operational forecasts derived from expectations of future operating performance, which require considerable management judgment regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change. Determining the estimated fair value requires multiple Level 3 inputs based on data available at the time of the quantitative assessment including, but not limited to, future revenue projections, discount rates, and royalty rates. Impairment is indicated if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than the carrying amount, and an impairment charge is recognized for the differential.
Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews for impairment indicators of finite-lived intangibles and other long-lived assets as described in the “Property and Equipment, Net” significant accounting policy.
The Company performed its qualitative annual impairment assessment for its indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangible assets as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, which did not identify indicators of impairment based on the information available at that time. It was determined that it was more likely than not each indefinite-lived intangible asset had fair values in excess of their carrying values and its finite-lived intangible assets did not indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
As a result of the declines of future revenue projections during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, the Company conducted an additional qualitative impairment assessment that identified potential indicators of impairment for the Atkins brand indefinite-lived intangible asset and the licensing agreements finite-lived intangible asset. Accordingly, the Company proceeded to conduct a quantitative impairment assessment over each asset. Based on our testing, the respective assets carrying values exceeded their fair values, resulting in a loss on impairment of $60.9 million in the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025. There were no impairment charges related to the Company’s indefinite-lived or finite-lived intangibles recognized in the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, or fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2023. We believe the estimates and assumptions utilized in our impairment assessment are reasonable and are comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. However, actual events and results could differ substantially from those utilized in our valuations. Significant declines of future revenue projections or changes of other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus those utilized at the time of the

initial valuations could result in further impairment charges that could materially affect the consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 5, Goodwill and Intangibles, for additional information regarding the Company’s reporting units and impairment assessments.
Deferred Financing Costs and Debt Discounts
Costs incurred in obtaining long-term financing paid to parties other than creditors are considered a deferred financing cost, which are presented net against 
Long-term debt, less current maturities
 on the balance sheet, and are amortized over the terms of the long-term financing agreements using the effective-interest method.. Amounts paid to creditors are recorded as a reduction in the proceeds received by the creditor and are considered a discount on the issuance of debt.

Income Taxes
Income taxes include federal, state and foreign taxes currently payable, and deferred taxes arising from temporary differences between income for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement balances and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the fiscal year that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts expected to be realized.
Leases
Contracts are evaluated to determine whether they contain a lease at inception. Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases based on criteria in ASC Topic 842, Leases. The Company’s operating leases are generally comprised of real estate and certain equipment used in warehousing products. The Company’s finance leases are generally comprised of warehouse equipment. 
Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The majority of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate; therefore, the Company uses its secured incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of future payments for those leases. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest it would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term to the lease in a similar economic environment. The Company applied incremental borrowing rates using a portfolio approach. Right-of-use assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term operating leases that have a term of one year or less.
The Company monitors for triggering events or conditions that require a reassessment of its leases. When the reassessment requires a re-measurement of the lease liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset. Additionally, the Company reviewed for impairment indicators of its right-of-use assets and other long-lived assets as described in the “Property and Equipment, Net” significant accounting policy.
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with its customer are satisfied. The Company has determined that fulfilling and delivering products is a single performance obligation. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when the Company has satisfied its performance obligation and the customer has obtained control of the products. This generally occurs when the product is delivered to or picked up by the customer based on applicable shipping terms, which is typically within 30 days.
Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for fulfilled product orders, including estimates of variable consideration. The most common forms of variable consideration include trade promotions, such as consumer incentives, coupon redemptions and other marketing activities, allowances for unsaleable product, and any additional amounts where a distinct good or service cannot be identified or the value cannot be reasonably estimated. Trade promotions are recorded as a reduction to net sales with a corresponding reduction to accounts receivable at the time of revenue recognition for the underlying sale. The recognition of trade promotions requires management to make estimates regarding the volume of incentive that will be redeemed and their total cost. As of August 30, 2025, and August 31, 2024, the allowance for trade promotions was $
37.8
 million and $
36.3
 million, respectively.
Estimates of variable consideration are made using various information including historical data on performance of similar trade promotional activities, market data from Circana, and the Company’s best estimate of current activity. The Company reviews these estimates regularly and makes revisions as necessary. Revisions can include changes for consideration paid to customers that lack sufficient evidence to support a distinct good or service assertion, or for which a reasonably estimable fair value cannot be determined, primarily related to the Company’s assessments of cooperative advertising programs. Uncertainties related to the estimate of variable consideration are resolved in a short time frame and do not require any additional constraint on variable consideration. Adjustments to variable consideration are recognized in

Table of Contents 
the period the adjustments are identified and have historically been insignificant. Revenue is recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
The Company provides standard assurance type warranties that its products will comply with all agreed-upon specifications. No services beyond an assurance type warranty are provided to customers. While customers generally have a right to return defective or non-conforming products, past experience has demonstrated that product returns have been immaterial. Customer remedies for defective or non-conforming products may include a refund or exchange. As a result, the right of return is estimated and recorded as a reduction in revenue at the time of sale, if necessary.
The Company’s customer contracts identify product quantity, price and payment terms. Payment terms are granted consistent with industry standards. Although some payment terms may be more extended, the majority of the Company’s payment terms are less than 60 days. As a result, revenue is not adjusted for the effects of a significant financing component. Amounts billed and due from customers are classified as 
Accounts receivable, net
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company utilizes third-party contract manufacturers for the manufacture of its products. The Company has evaluated whether it is the principal or agent in these relationships. The Company has determined that it is the principal in all cases, as it retains the responsibility for fulfillment and risk of loss, as well as establishes the price.
In accordance with ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Company has elected the practical expedient to expense the incremental costs to obtain a contract, because the amortization period would be less than one year, and the practical expedient for shipping and handling costs. Shipping and handling costs incurred to deliver products to customers are accounted for as fulfillment activities, rather than a promised service, and as such are included in 
Cost of goods sold 
in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.
Revenues from transactions with external customers for each of the Company’s products would be impracticable to disclose and management does not view its business by product line. For revenue disaggregated by geographic area and brand refer to Note 15, Segment and Customer Information.

Business Combination
On 
April 29, 2024
, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Simply Good Foods, USA, Inc. entered into a Purchase Agreement to acquire OWYN, a plant-based protein food company, for approximately $
280.0
 million. On June 13, 2024, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the OWYN Acquisition by acquiring 100% of the equity interests for a cash purchase price at closing of $
281.9
 million, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments. We acquired OWYN as a part of our vision to lead the nutritious snacking movement with trusted brands that offer a variety of convenient, innovative, great-tasting, better-for-you snacks and meal replacements that will now offer plant-based products to a wider market of consumers.
The OWYN Acquisition was funded through a combination of incremental borrowings under our outstanding Term Facility, as defined below, totaling $
250.0
 million and cash on hand. In the second fiscal quarter of 2025, the Company received a post-closing release from escrow of approximately $
1.7
 million related to net working capital adjustments, resulting in a total net consideration paid of $280.2 million. Business transaction costs within the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, were $
0.8
 million, which consisted of legal, accounting, and other costs. Business transaction costs within the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income for the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, were $
14.5
 million, inclusive of $
5.7
 million of transaction advisory fees related to the OWYN Acquisition, $
3.4
 million of non-deferrable third-party financing costs incurred in connection with the 2024 Incremental Facility Amendment to the Credit Agreement, and $
5.4
 million of legal, due diligence, accounting, and other costs.
The OWYN Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), which requires, among other things, assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair value. The following table sets forth the final purchase price allocation, completed in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2025, of the OWYN Acquisition to the estimated fair value of the total assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the Acquisition, in thousands.
The final June 13, 2024, fair value is as follows:

(1)
Inventory was estimated using the comparative sales method, which quantifies the fair value of inventory based on the expected sales price of the subject inventory, reduced for: (i) all costs expected to be incurred in its completion/disposition efforts and (ii) a profit on those costs.
(2)
Intangible assets were recorded at fair value consistent with ASC 820 as a result of the OWYN Acquisition. Intangible assets consist of $
223.0
 million of brand and $
20.5
 million of customer relationships. The useful lives of the intangible assets are disclosed in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair value measurement of the assets and liabilities was based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 measurements within the fair value measurement hierarchy. Level 3 fair market values were determined using a variety of information, including estimated future cash flows and market comparable data and companies.
The fair value of the indefinite-lived brand asset was estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method of the income approach, wherein the net earnings attributable to the asset are isolated from other “contributory assets” in order to estimate the cash flows solely attributable to the asset over its remaining economic life.

Table of Contents 
The fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset was estimated using the with/without method of the income approach, wherein the value is estimated by comparing the overall business cash flows with the customer relationships in place to the cash flows in a hypothetical scenario where the customer relationships are not in place. The significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value under the with/without method include the time to recreate the asset, profitability under both scenarios, and the estimated discount rate.
(3)
Primarily as a result of the fair value attributable to the identifiable intangible assets, the deferred income tax liability was $
41.5
 million.
(4)
Goodwill was recorded at fair value consistent with ASC 820 as a result of the OWYN Acquisition. Amounts recorded for goodwill created in an acquisition structured as a stock purchase for tax are generally not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. As such, the acquired goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized.
Measurement period adjustments are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined and calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In the second fiscal quarter of 2025, a measurement period adjustment of $
1.7
 million was recorded to goodwill. The final fair value determination of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was completed prior to one year from the transaction completion, consistent with ASC 805.
The results of OWYN’s operations have been included in the Simply Good Foods' Consolidated Financial Statements since June 13, 2024, the acquisition date. The Company has not disclosed earnings from the acquired OWYN business as they are immaterial. The following table provides net sales from the acquired OWYN business included in the Company's results:

Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information
Pro forma financial information is not intended to represent or be indicative of the actual results of operations of the combined business that would have been reported had the OWYN Acquisition been completed at the beginning of the fiscal year 2023, nor is it representative of future operating results of the Company.
This unaudited pro forma combined financial information is prepared based on ASC 805 period end guidance. The Company and the legacy OWYN entity have different fiscal year ends, with Simply Good Foods’ fiscal year being the last Saturday of August while the legacy OWYN business fiscal year end was December 31. Because the year ends differ by more than 93 days, OWYN's financial information is required to be adjusted to a period within 93 days of Simply Good Foods’ fiscal period end. In addition to these period end adjustments, the pro forma results include certain nonrecurring adjustments that were directly related to the business combination, including business transaction costs, as disclosed above.

Changes in 
Intangible assets, net
 during the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, were primarily related to the impairment of the Atkins brand and trademarks indefinite-lived intangible asset and the licensing agreements finite-lived intangible asset, and recurring amortization expense. Changes related to the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, were primarily related to the OWYN Acquisition and recurring amortization expense. In conjunction with the Acquisition, the Company acquired a brand indefinite lived intangible asset and a customer relationship intangible asset, which had fair values of approximately $
223.0
 million and $
20.5
 million as of the date of the Acquisition, respectively. Changes related to the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2023, were primarily related to recurring amortization expense.
The Company performed its qualitative annual impairment assessment for its indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangible assets as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, which did not identify indicators of impairment based on the information available at that time. It was determined that it was more likely than not each indefinite-lived intangible asset had fair values in excess of their carrying values and its finite-lived intangible assets did not indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
As a result of the declines of future revenue projections during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, the Company conducted an additional qualitative impairment assessment that identified potential indicators of impairment for the Atkins brand indefinite-lived intangible asset and the licensing agreements finite-lived intangible asset. Accordingly, the Company proceeded to conduct a quantitative impairment assessment over each asset. Based on our testing, the respective assets carrying values exceeded their fair values, resulting in a loss on impairment of $60.9 million in the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025. There were no impairment charges related to the Company’s indefinite-lived or finite-lived intangibles recognized in the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, or fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2023. We believe the estimates and assumptions utilized in our impairment assessment are reasonable and are comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. However, actual events and results could differ substantially from those utilized in our valuations. Significant declines of future revenue projections or changes of other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus those utilized at the time of the initial valuations could result in further impairment charges that could materially affect the consolidated financial statements.
Amortization expense related to intangible assets was $
15.1
 million for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, $
15.2
 million for the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, and $

Long-Term Debt and Line of Credit
On July 7, 2017, the Company (through certain of its subsidiaries) entered into a credit agreement with Barclays Bank PLC and other parties (as amended to date, the “Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement at that time provided for (i) a term facility of $
200.0
 million (“Term Facility”) with a 
seven
-year maturity and (ii) a revolving credit facility of up to $
75.0
 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with a 
five
-year maturity. Substantially concurrent with the consummation of the business combination which formed the Company between Conyers Park Acquisition Corp. and NCP-ATK Holdings, Inc. on July 7, 2017, the full $
200.0
 million of the Term Facility (the “Term Loan”) was drawn.
On November 7, 2019, the Company entered into a second amendment (the “Incremental Facility Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to increase the principal borrowed on the Term Facility by $
460.0
 million. The Term Facility together with the incremental borrowing make up the Initial Term Loans (as defined in the Incremental Facility Amendment). The Incremental Facility Amendment was executed to partially finance the acquisition of Quest Nutrition, LLC on November 7, 2019. No amounts under the Term Facility were repaid as a result of the execution of the Incremental Facility Amendment.
Effective as of December 16, 2021, the Company entered into a third amendment (the “Extension Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement. The Extension Amendment provided for an extension of the stated maturity date of the Revolving Commitments and Revolving Loans (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) from July 7, 2022, to the earlier of (i) 91 days prior to the then-effective maturity date of the Initial Term Loans and (ii) December 16, 2026.
On January 21, 2022, the Company entered into the “2022 Repricing Amendment” to the Credit Agreement. The 2022 Repricing Amendment, among other things, (i) reduced the interest rate per annum applicable to the Initial Term Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement immediately prior to the effective date of the 2022 Repricing Amendment, (ii) reset the prepayment premium for the existing Initial Term Loans to apply to Repricing Transactions (as defined in the Credit Agreement) that occur within six months after the effective date of the 2022 Repricing Amendment, and (iii) implemented SOFR and related replacement provisions for LIBOR.
On April 25, 2023, the Company entered into the “2023 Repricing Amendment” to the Credit Agreement. The 2023 Repricing Amendment, (i) reduced the interest rate per annum applicable to the Initial Term Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement immediately prior to April 25, 2023, and (ii) provided for an extension of the maturity date of the Initial Term Loans from July 7, 2024, to March 17, 2027.
On June 13, 2024, the Company entered into a sixth amendment (the “2024 Incremental Facility Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to increase the principal borrowed on the Term Facility by $
250.0
 million. The terms of the incremental borrowing are the same as the terms of the outstanding borrowings under the Term Facility. The 2024 Incremental Facility Amendment was executed to partially finance the OWYN Acquisition. No amounts under the Term Facility were repaid as a result of the execution of the 2024 Incremental Facility Amendment.
On January 31, 2025, the Company entered into a seventh amendment (the “2025 Repricing Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement to reduce the interest rate per annum applicable to the Initial Term Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement immediately prior to the effective date of the 2025 Repricing Amendment. 
67
Table of Contents 
Effective as of the 2025 Repricing Amendment, the interest rate per annum for the Initial Term Loans is based on either:
i.
A base rate equaling the higher of (a) the “prime rate,” (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 
0.50
%, or (c) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) applicable for an interest period of one month plus 
1.00
% plus (x) 
1.00
% margin for the Term Loan or (y) 
2.00
% margin for the Revolving Credit Facility; or
ii.
SOFR, subject to a floor of 
0.50
%, plus (x) 
2.00
% margin for the Term Loan or (y) 
3.00
% margin for the Revolving Credit Facility.
In connection with the closing of the 2025 Repricing Amendment, the Company expensed $
0.7
 million of non-deferrable third-party costs through 
General and administrative
 expenses within the

Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income.
The Simply Good Foods Company is not a borrower under the Credit Agreement and has not provided a guarantee of the Credit Agreement. Simply Good Foods USA, Inc., is the administrative borrower and certain other subsidiary holding companies are co-borrowers under the Credit Agreement. Each of the Company’s domestic subsidiaries that is not a named borrower under the Credit Agreement has provided a guarantee on a secured basis. As security for the payment or performance of the debt under the Credit Agreement, the borrowers and the guarantors have pledged certain equity interests in their respective subsidiaries and granted the lenders a security interest in substantially all of their domestic assets. All guarantors other than Quest Nutrition, LLC and Only What You Need, Inc. are holding companies with no assets other than their investments in their respective subsidiaries.
The Credit Agreement contains certain financial and other covenants that limit the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur and/or undertake asset sales and other dispositions, liens, indebtedness, certain acquisitions and investments, consolidations, mergers, reorganizations and other fundamental changes, payment of dividends and other distributions to equity and warrant holders, and prepayments of material subordinated debt, in each case, subject to customary exceptions materially consistent with credit facilities of such type and size. The Revolving Credit Facility has a maximum total net leverage ratio equal to or less than 
6.00
:1.00 contingent on credit extensions in excess of 
30
% of the total amount of commitments available under the Revolving Credit Facility. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit facilities may result in an event of default. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants as of August 30, 2025, and August 31, 2024, respectively.
Long-term debt consists of the following:

As of August 30, 2025, the Company had letters of credit in the amount of $
0.9
 million outstanding. These letters of credit offset against the $
75.0
 million availability of the Revolving Credit Facility and exist to support two of the Company’s leased buildings. No amounts were drawn against these letters of credit at August 30, 2025.        
The Company is not required to make principal payments on the Term Facility over the twelve months following the period ended August 30, 2025. The outstanding balance of the Term Facility is due upon its maturity in March 2027.
As of August 30, 2025, aggregate principal maturities of debt for each of the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:

The Company utilizes market approaches to estimate the fair value of certain outstanding borrowings by discounting anticipated future cash flows derived from the contractual terms of the obligations and observable market interest and foreign exchange rates. The Company carries debt at historical cost and discloses fair value. As of August 30, 2025, and August 31, 2024, the book value of the Company’s debt approximated fair value. The estimated fair value of the Term Loan is valued based on observable inputs and classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measurements, a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies, is used:
Level 1 – Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
Level 2 – Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 – Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment.
There were 
no
 transfers of financial instruments between the three levels of the fair value hierarchy during the fiscal years ended August 30, 2025, August 31, 2024, and August 26, 2023, respectively.
The Company’s non-financial assets, which consist primarily of property and equipment, right-of-use assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets, are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis and are reported at carrying value. The fair values of these assets are determined, as required, based on Level 3 measurements, including estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows based upon historical experience, expected market conditions, and management’s plans. All other components of the balance sheet such as accounts receivable, cash and cash equivalents, and others approximate fair value as of August 30, 2025.

The Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $
35.6
 million and $
63.0
 million, state net operating loss carryforwards of $
30.8
 million and $
44.2
 million, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $
0.4
 million and $
1.7
 million as of August 30, 2025 and August 31, 2024, respectively. Federal net operating loss carryforwards do not expire and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2036.
As of August 30, 2025, the Company has recorded total valuation allowances of $
0.4
 million, of which $
0.4
 million relates to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards. This amount represents a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of foreign entities within Australia. During the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, there was a $1.3 million decrease to the tax loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions. As the carryforwards were generated in jurisdictions where the Company has historically recognized book losses or does not have strong future earnings projections, the Company concluded it is more likely than not that the operating losses would not be realized, and thus maintained a full valuation allowance against the associated deferred tax assets.

Table of Contents 
As of August 30, 2025, the Company does not intend to indefinitely reinvest its foreign earnings within its subsidiary in Canada and has not recognized any tax liabilities related to this jurisdiction. It is the Company’s intention to reinvest the earnings of its other non-U.S. subsidiaries in its Australia and New Zealand operations. As of August 30, 2025, the Company has not made a provision for U.S. or additional foreign withholding taxes for any outside basis differences inherent in its investments in foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries.
As of August 30, 2025, and August 31, 2024, the Company has 
no
 unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company records interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. As of August 30, 2025, and August 31, 2024, the Company has 
not
 accrued any interest or penalties on unrecognized tax benefits, as there is no position recorded as of these fiscal year-ends. No changes to the uncertain tax position balance are anticipated within the next 12 months and are not expected to materially affect the financial statements.
As of August 30, 2025, tax years 2018 to 2024 remain subject to examination in the United States by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities and the tax years 2018 to 2024 remain subject to examination in other major foreign jurisdictions where the Company conducts business. State income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to six years after the filing of the respective return.
The future utilization of federal net operating loss carryforwards generated after 2017 is limited to 80% of taxable income. An additional limitation applies to the use of federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, that is applicable if the Company experiences an "ownership change”. The Company has experienced various “ownership changes” in prior years. The resulting Section 382 limitations are not expected to materially affect the Company’s ability to utilize carryforwards. Future changes in the ownership of the Company could further limit the Company’s ability to utilize its net operating losses and credits.
In 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) announced Pillar Two Model Rules, which call for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15%. Many non-U.S. tax jurisdictions have either recently enacted legislation to adopt certain components of the Pillar Two Model Rules beginning in fiscal 2025 with the adoption of additional components in later years or announced their plans to enact legislation in future years. The currently enacted Pillar Two Model Rules are not expected to have a significant effect on the Company’s provision for income taxes. The Company continues to monitor developments and evaluate effects, if any, of these provisions on its results of operations and cash flows for future years.
On July 4, 2025, the H.R.1 tax law was enacted in the U.S. (the “H.R.1 Tax Act”). The H.R.1 Tax Act includes provisions, such as the permanent extension of certain expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, modifications to the international tax framework, and the restoration of favorable tax treatment for certain business provisions. The H.R.1 Tax Act has multiple effective dates, beginning in calendar year 2025 and extending through calendar year 2027. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the H.R.1 Tax Act on its effective income tax rate, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Earnings Per Share 
Basic earnings or loss per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding. In computing diluted earnings per share, basic earnings per share is adjusted for the assumed issuance of all potentially dilutive securities, including the Company’s employee stock options and non-vested stock units.
In periods in which the Company has a net loss, diluted loss per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding as the effect of including common stock equivalents outstanding would be anti-dilutive.

Omnibus Incentive Plan
Stock-based compensation includes stock options, restricted stock units, performance stock unit awards, and stock appreciation rights, which are awarded to employees, directors, and consultants of the Company. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on its grant date fair value. Stock-based compensation expense is included within 
General and administrative
 expense, which is the same financial statement caption where the recipient’s other compensation is reported.
For the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, and the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, and fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2023, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $
15.3
 million, $
18.4
 million, and $
14.5
 million, respectively.
In July 2017, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Incentive Plan”). The Incentive Plan provides for the issuance of a maximum of 
9,067,917
 shares of stock-denominated awards to directors, employees, officers and agents of the Company. As of August 30, 2025, there were 
2.5
 million shares available for grant under the Incentive Plan.

As the Company has now been listed for more than six years for the years presented above, which is broadly consistent with the expected term of the options, the Company has based its Black-Scholes valuation model’s expected volatility assumption on the actual volatility of its daily closing share price over the period since listing to the valuation date. The risk-free rates are based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term. Future annual dividends over the expected term are estimated to be 
nil
.
As of August 30, 2025, the Company had $
1.1
 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option plans that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 
0.9
 years. During the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, and fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2023, the Company received $

Performance Stock Units
During the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, the Board of Directors granted performance stock units under the Company’s 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan. The number of shares issuable as a result of grants of performance stock units is determined based on market-based criteria, performance-based criteria, or a combination of market-based criteria and performance-based criteria. The number of shares may be increased or decreased based on the results of these metrics in accordance with the terms established at the date of grant.
For market-based criteria awards, the Company’s relative total shareholder return, or relative TSR, is measured for the Company and each company in the Russell 3000 Food & Beverage index using the immediately preceding 30-day average share price at the beginning and end of the applicable 
three
-year performance period. The percentile rank of the Company’s TSR relative to that of the peer group determines the percent of the target award earned, ranging between 
0
% and 
200
%. The related compensation expense is recognized ratably over the term regardless of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided the requisite service is rendered. These units are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation.
For Company financial performance-based criteria awards, we estimate the probability that the Company’s internally established performance criteria will be achieved at each reporting period and adjust compensation expense accordingly. The performance metrics achieved determines the percent of the target award earned, ranging between 0% and 200%. These units are valued using the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.
For market-based criteria and Company financial performance-based criteria awards, the Company’s TSR within the peer group and the performance metrics achieved determines the percent of the target award earned, ranging between 0% and 275%. We estimate the probability that the performance criteria will be achieved at each reporting period and adjust compensation expense accordingly. Should the performance-based criteria not be probable of being achieved, the compensation expense for the value of the award incorporating the market-based criteria is recognized ratably over the term, provided the requisite service is rendered. These units are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation.
The following table summarizes performance stock unit activity for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025:

Stock Appreciation Rights
Stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) permit the holder to participate in the appreciation of the Company’s common stock price and are awarded to non-employee consultants of the Company. The Company’s SARs settle in shares of its common stock if and when the applicable vesting criteria has been met. The SARs outstanding as of August 30, 2025 cliff vested two years from the date of grant and must be exercised within five years from the date of grant.

Segment and Customer Information
Segment Information
The Company's operations are organized into two operating segments, Quest and Atkins, and OWYN, which are aggregated into one reportable segment due to similar financial, economic and operating characteristics. The operating segments are similar in the following areas: (a) the nature of the products; (b) the nature of the production processes; (c) the methods used to distribute products to customers; (d) the type of customer for the products; and, (e) the nature of the regulatory environment. The Company also designed its organizational structure to support entity-wide business functions across brands, products, customers, and geographic regions. As a result, as of the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, and fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, the Company determined its operations are organized into 
two
 operating segments, which are aggregated into one reportable segment, represented by the Company’s consolidated financial statements, due to similar financial, economic and operating characteristics. As of the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2023, the Company determined its operations were organized into 
one
 consolidated operating segment and reportable segment.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). The CODM regularly reviews consolidated segment performance including net sales, significant expenses, net income, Adjusted EBITDA, budget to actual variance analysis, as well as other key metrics. The CODM uses net income as the measure of profitability to assess segment performance and allocate resources. The accounting policies of the segment are the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
The following table summarizes our segment net sales, significant expenses, and net income for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, and fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2023:

None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required financial disclosures.
Management, including the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation (pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act) of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of August 30, 2025, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for designing, implementing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (“ICFR”), as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Management assessed the effectiveness of our ICFR as of August 30, 2025. Management based its assessment on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the assessment using this criteria, management has concluded that our ICFR was effective as of August 30, 2025. 
Because of its inherent limitations, ICFR may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Additionally, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The effectiveness of our ICFR as of August 30, 2025, was audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing below, which expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our ICFR as of August 30, 2025.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
As a result of the OWYN Acquisition, we have designed and implemented internal controls over financial reporting for OWYN processes and incorporated such controls into the Company’s ICFR framework.
Except as disclosed above, there were no changes in our ICFR during the quarter ended August 30, 2025, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our ICFR.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of The Simply Good Foods Company
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Simply Good Foods Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of August 30, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 30, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, of the Company and our report dated October 28, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion 
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
