Item 1. Business. 
Overview
The Simply Good Foods Company is a consumer packaged food and beverage company that aims to lead the nutritious snacking movement with trusted brands that offer a variety of convenient, innovative, great-tasting, better-for-you snacks and meal replacements, and other product offerings that seek to address consumers’ increasing demand for protein-rich food, that are low in carbohydrates and added sugar. The product portfolio we develop, market and sell consists primarily of protein bars, ready-to-drink (“RTD”) protein shakes, sweet and salty protein snacks and confectionery products marketed under the Quest, Atkins, and OWYN brand names. Simply Good Foods is poised to expand its wellness platform through innovation and organic growth along with acquisition opportunities.
Our nutritious snacking platform consists of brands that specialize in providing products for consumers that follow certain nutritional philosophies and health-and-wellness trends: Quest for consumers seeking a variety of protein-rich foods and beverages that also limit sugars and simple carbohydrates, Atkins for those following a low-carbohydrate lifestyle or seeking to manage weight or blood sugar levels, and OWYN for consumers seeking protein-rich beverages that are plant-based and tested for the top nine allergens that also limit sugars and simple carbohydrates. We distribute our products in major retail channels, primarily in North America, including grocery, club, and mass merchandise, and through e-commerce, convenience, specialty, and other channels. Our portfolio of nutritious snacking brands gives us a strong platform with which to introduce new products, expand distribution, and attract new consumers to our products.
We believe snacking occasions have been on the rise in recent years as consumers continue to desire more convenient, healthy and delicious foods, snacks, and meal replacements. We believe our emphasis on product formats such as our protein bars, cookies, chips and salty snacks, confections, RTD protein shakes, and protein powders position us to fill important needs for consumers. We believe several existing and emerging consumer trends within the U.S. food and beverage industry will continue to drive both the growth of the nutritional snacking category and increase the demand for our product offerings. Some of these trends include increased consumption of smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day, consumers’ strong preference for convenient, “better-for-you” snacks, consumers’ greater focus on health and wellness, consumers seeking to add convenient sources of protein and fiber to their diets, and consumers’ movement toward increasing the consumption of protein, limiting carbohydrate and sugar consumption or avoiding certain allergens.
With our Quest brand, we strive to offer an attractive lineup of protein bars, cookies, protein chips and salty snacks, RTD protein shakes and other beverages, and confections, which target these existing and emerging consumer trends. With our Atkins brand, we strive to offer a compelling line of protein bars, RTD protein shakes, and confections. With our OWYN brand, we strive to offer RTD protein shakes and protein powders that are plant-based and tested for the top nine allergens in a variety of protein levels. Our sales, marketing, and research and development capabilities enable us to distribute products to a national customer base across a spectrum of retail channels, including the mass merchandise, grocery, drug, club stores, e-commerce, and small format retail such as convenience stores and gas stations.
The Simply Good Foods Company (“Simply Good Foods”) was formed in March 2017, to acquire NCP-ATK Holdings, Inc. (“Atkins”), which was completed in July 2017. As part of Simply Good Foods’ strategy to become an industry leading snacking platform, in November 2019, we acquired Quest Nutrition, LLC (“Quest”) and we acquired Only What You Need, Inc. in June 2024. We refer to the acquisition of Quest Nutrition, LLC as the “Quest Acquisition” and the acquisition of Only What You Need, Inc. as the “OWYN Acquisition”.
Our principal executive offices are located at 1225 17

Our Strengths
Powerful brands with strong consumer awareness and loyalty
. We are a leader in the fast-growing nutritional snacking category, and our Quest, Atkins and OWYN brands are leading brands with combined scale in protein bars, protein chips, confections, cookies, RTD protein shakes, and protein powders. Our highly focused snacking portfolio provides us with a leading position within retailers’ nutrition and wellness aisles, resulting in meaningful shelf space. Our brands can appeal to consumers interested in an active lifestyle who are seeking protein-rich, low-carb snacking options, consumers looking to manage weight through the several approaches including using medications such as GLP-1s and weight management programs, and consumers looking to consume protein through convenient RTD protein shakes and powders that are plant-based and tested for the top nine allergens, which makes our brands highly attractive and strategic for a diverse set of retailers across various distribution channels.
Aligned with consumer mega trends. 
Increasing global concern about growing rates of obesity and weight-related diseases and other health issues has resulted in increased scientific, media and consumer focus on nutrition. Over 100 independent, peer reviewed, clinical studies show the benefits of controlling carbohydrates. In addition, consumers are increasingly looking to increase the level of protein consumption in their diets. We believe this focus is prompting consumers to rebalance their nutritional breakdown to increase protein and shift away from 
6
carbohydrates. Our brand attributes, “protein-rich” “low-carb,” “low-sugar” nutrition, are well-aligned with consumer mega trends. In addition, we believe consumers’ eating habits are gradually shifting towards increased convenience, snacking and meal replacement. We also believe our portfolio of convenient and nutritious products and our ongoing effort to meet consumer demands for convenient snacking options support their individual health, nutrition, allergen sensitivities, and lifestyle goals.
Scalable snacking and food platform.
 We have been able to grow our product offerings for our nutritious snacking brands through our line extensions and through acquisitions. Our in-house product development experience and our outsourced manufacturing model allow us to bring new products to market quickly. We pride ourselves on knowing our consumers and gleaning insights that lead to new products and ideas. We believe we can leverage our strong relationships with our retail customers and distributors, a strong brand building track record, and category management expertise to help new products, brands and brand extensions gain distribution and consumer recognition, allowing us to continue to successfully expand our snacking platform. We believe our strong balance sheet allows us to participate in attractive acquisition opportunities.
Asset-light business with strong cash generation
. We retain core in-house capabilities including sales, marketing, brand management, customer relationships, product development, and supply-chain expertise, while collaborating with a diversified pool of contract manufacturers and distributors to execute manufacturing and distribution. Outsourcing these competencies allows us to focus our efforts on consumer insights, innovation, marketing, and sales to meet consumer demands. Our lean infrastructure allows for significant flexibility, speed-to-market, and targeted capital investment, which translates into relatively consistent and robust free cash flow generation over time, driven by strong gross margins.
Experienced leadership team
. Simply Good Foods has an experienced team of industry veterans with extensive experience across multiple branded consumer products, food and nutrition categories. Our management team’s extensive experience is complemented by the significant industry expertise of our Board of Directors. Our management team’s deep expertise and proven record of accomplishment in managing brands and operating packaged food businesses is a key driver of our success and we believe positions Simply Good Foods as an attractive vehicle for future long-term growth within the food industry.
Our Strategies
Innovate and expand the portfolio of product offerings to meet consumer demand for higher protein products and new product forms. 
We intend to continue to enhance, strengthen and expand our product offerings with new and innovative flavors and forms and packaging alternatives, all while maintaining a commitment to delivering products that meet our targeted nutritional profile and provide the convenience and taste consumers desire. Our in-house research and development laboratories allow us to develop new products internally and bring them to market quickly through our contract manufacturing network without diverging from high standards of taste, nutritional content, quality, and safety. Additionally, we intend to satisfy developing and changing consumer preferences through the continued pursuit of merger and acquisition transactions.
Leverage platform to expand in attractive food and snacking categories
. We believe the fragmented snacking category presents an opportunity for growth and the opportunity to build, through disciplined acquisitions, a leading platform in the nutritional snacking space. As a leader in nutritious snacking, we believe we have the unique capability to leverage our operating platform, product innovation expertise and customer relationships to expand beyond our current brands. In addition, we believe the nutritious snacking category will continue to grow given its relatively low household penetration and favorable consumer trends of snacking, health and wellness, convenience, and on-the-go consumption. Our experienced management team has deep expertise in brand building that we believe will help us to expand the business into additional brands and products in the snacking segment. Over time, we expect to continue seeking to identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities to complement our platform, and we see significant opportunity for growth and synergies in complementary adjacent snacking categories such as the “better-for-you” eating space.
Expand distribution in white space opportunities. 
For our fiscal year 2025, approximately 76% of Quest’s gross sales in the U.S., approximately 81% of Atkins’ gross sales in the U.S., and approximately 73% of OWYN’s gross sales in the U.S. were through the mass retailer, grocery and convenience store distribution channels. Our management believes there is opportunity for each of our brands to further penetrate those channels as well as other distribution channels such as convenience and club stores. In addition, while shoppers have increased e-commerce purchases generally, in fiscal year 2025, approximately 22% of Quest’s gross sales, approximately 19% of Atkins’ gross sales, and approximately 26% of OWYN’s gross sales were through the e-commerce channel. We intend to leverage our brand recognition to develop further the distribution channels through which we reach consumers, including through the continued expansion of the e-commerce channel.
Continue our marketing efforts and strategies to both increase household penetration and reach consumers beyond our core historic buyers. 
We intend to expand our marketing efforts to bring first-time buyers into the Quest, Atkins and OWYN brand franchises. For our Quest brand, our historic consumer base has been individuals pursuing a performance-based active and athletic lifestyle seeking protein-rich foods. For our Atkins’ brand it has been people interested in weight management or pursuing a lifestyle of eating low carbohydrate foods. And, for our OWYN brand, the historic consumer base has been consumers looking for an allergen sensitive, plant-based and non-dairy RTD protein shake or protein powder that is high in protein and low in carbohydrates and sugar. As public opinion on the use of chronic weight management medication is shifting significantly as the popularity of clinical solutions grows and more medications are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
7
(“FDA”), we are looking to communicate to consumers who have elected to use these medications what we believe are the complementary benefits of using our products to support achieving or maintaining their weight management goals.
For all our brands, we have an active and growing digital and social presence, using a comprehensive approach of search, banner, and search engine optimization efforts. We are a leader in social media, with an evolving social media presence on major channels such as Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, X (formerly known as Twitter) TikTok, and YouTube. We also have a growing network of social influencers and content creators, who promote our products in their targeted social media posts. We believe social media is a cost-effective way of continuing to attract and retain our consumers. We believe our ongoing efforts to educate consumers about the benefits of our nutritional philosophy and lifestyle will further reinforce our brands. For our Quest brand, we have used national, targeted broadcast ad campaigns, and continue to leverage targeted streaming television ads and an extensive network of social media influencers and content creators who prompt both our Quest brand products through their online posts to motivate new buyers and product introductions. For our Atkins brand, we are shifting our marketing efforts toward more digital marketing activities including social media influencers. Atkins has historically used targeted broadcast and streaming television and print ads with a celebrity-based campaign that attempts to (i) motivate potential programmatic weight loss consumers to try the Atkins approach to healthier eating and weight loss as these Atkins consumers are our most loyal, profitable and frequent purchasers and (ii) broaden the reach of the Atkins brand to appeal to those consumers generally interested in low carbohydrate, low sugar nutrition. For the OWYN brand, we have used an extensive network of social media influencers and content creators who promote our OWYN brand products through their online posts to motivate and attract new buyers.
We intend to continue to make focused changes to our approach to consumer outreach to attract consumers beyond our historic core buyers. For our Quest brand, we intend to enhance our marketing efforts to reach more consumers who are seeking products that are aligned with their choice to pursue a healthy and active lifestyle. For the Atkins brand, we intend to continue our marketing efforts to attract health motivated eaters (including those individuals not on a program diet) who buy and consume our Atkins products as well as those consumers who have elected to use medication as part of their approach to achieve or maintain their weight management goals. For our OWYN brand, we intend to enhance our marketing efforts to reach more consumers who are interested in RTDs and powders and other product forms that are plant-based and tested for the top nine allergens in a variety of protein levels.

Marketing, Advertising and Consumer Outreach
Our marketing efforts are designed to maintain and increase consumer awareness of and demand for our products. We employ a broad mix of marketing, including coupons, product sampling, consumer and trade events, advertising (television, online and print) and recipe and food plans, to target our consumers. We also use online resources, including social media sites, to communicate with consumers and build interest in our brands. Our advertising and use of online resources are aimed at maintaining and increasing consumer preference and usage of our brands. Our trade promotions focus on obtaining retail feature and display support, achieving optimum retail product prices and securing retail shelf space. We use coupons (freestanding insert newspaper, store register, on-pack and online coupons) to help stimulate product trial and repeat purchases by providing consumers with economic incentives. The mix of these marketing activities varies among our brands.
As part of our advocacy on the advantages of a protein-rich, low-carbohydrate, low-sugar dietary approach, and with respect to our OWYN brand, plant-based, diary free and allergen sensitive, we have devoted portions of our respective brand websites and social media to promote consumer education, engagement, and dialogue about the benefits of our nutritional approaches and how our products can fit within those approaches. Our sales and marketing team gathers information and feedback from consumers and retailers to enable us to better meet changing consumer needs. We also believe that an effective marketing tool is to share educational information through our brand websites to explain each brand’s approach to nutrition and the nutritional qualities of our products. We also provide access to consumer service representatives to answer questions and educate consumers on nutrition, new products and developments. As part of this approach, over time, for those consumers who have elected to use weight management medications to pursue their weight management goals we expect to continue developing and enhancing our marketing messages regarding how we believe our products can be used to meet their snacking use occasions and be complementary to their use of medication for weight management to achieve and maintain their weight management goals.
For our brands, in order to facilitate awareness and knowledge of the health benefits of a low-carbohydrate, low-sugar and protein-rich eating approach, whether dairy or plant-based, we have established a variety of marketing and advertising strategies to connect with consumers, including digital marketing and social media platforms, television broadcast and streaming advertising as well as celebrity and social media influencer endorsements.
We have built large consumer followings for our brands. Beyond the core historic consumers for each of our brands, we believe there is significant opportunity to increase household penetration for our products by expanding our marketing, product offerings and educational efforts to consumers who are focused more generally on long-term healthy living.
In the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, approximately 57% of 
Selling and marketing
 expenses were spent on advertising costs.

Retailers
We have a wide variety of customers across the mass merchandise, food, club, drug, small format, and e-commerce channels. A substantial majority of our sales are generated from a limited number of retailers. Sales to our largest retailer, Walmart Inc., represented approximately 31% of consolidated sales in fiscal year 2025, with approximately 24% through their mass retail channel and approximately 7% through their Sam’s Club and e-commerce channels. Sales to our next largest retailer, Amazon, represented approximately 18% of consolidated sales in fiscal year 2025. No other customer represents more than 10% of consolidated sales. For additional information, please see the risk factor “
We rely on sales to a limited number of retailers for a substantial majority of our net sales, and losing one or more such retailers may materially harm our business. In addition, we maintain “at will” contracts with these retailers, which do not require recurring or minimum purchase amounts of our products
”.
E-Commerce
We aim to ensure that our consumers may access our brand in the way that best suits their lifestyles by offering online ordering of our products. We sell our products on 
questnutrition.com, Atkins.com, liveowyn.com, Amazon.com
 and the e-commerce platforms of our brick-and-mortar customers, which all deliver our products directly to the location designated by the consumer.
Product Innovation
A portion of our sales is driven by new products, and as a result, we believe innovation is, and will continue to be, an important component of our business. We take a deliberate approach to new product development, focusing on enhancing existing products, innovating flavor and form varieties, and expanding into adjacent snacking products. Our innovation model is designed to respond to competitive demands, with a primary focus on enhancing the quality and flavor of our products while simplifying composition and ingredients to meet consumer demands for unique nutrition options.
Our innovation strategy is based on ongoing research into consumers’ healthy lifestyle and nutritional needs. We pride ourselves on knowing our consumers and developing products that meet their needs. Providing variety in snacking options to our consumers is an important strategy in our product innovation. New flavors, textures and snacking formats are important to meeting consumer needs.
We believe an important component of meeting consumers’ nutritional needs is a focus on evolving current products. We are committed to continually finding new and innovative formulations for our products, as well as using “better-for-you” ingredients like nuts, fiber and various plant- and dairy-based protein, while continually improving taste and quality.
We maintain an in-house research and development team as well as market research and consumer insight capabilities. Through our research and development labs in El Segundo, California, and Broomfield, Colorado, we control our brands’ innovations and product formulations from the ground up. By developing new products, prototypes and adjacencies in-house, we facilitate our core competencies in product innovation and enhance our speed to market.
In addition, as part of our innovation process, we collaborate with nationally recognized third-party flavor providers and product development firms for new product development and then conduct our own proprietary consumer research to identify and improve upon new product concepts. We plan to continue conducting extensive consumer research to develop successful new products including product flavor and concept testing, marketing and trend analysis, and consumer prototype testing.
We also believe the fragmented snacking category presents an opportunity for consolidation and the opportunity to build, through disciplined acquisitions, a leading platform in the nutritional snacking space. As a leader in nutritious snacking, we believe we have the unique capability to leverage our operating platform and customer relationships to expand beyond our current brands. Our experienced management team has deep expertise in brand building to expand the business into additional brands and products in the nutritional snacking segment and beyond. Simply Good Foods is actively seeking to identify and evaluate new acquisition opportunities to complement our existing portfolio and sees significant opportunity for growth and synergies in complementary adjacent snacking categories such as sports/active and adult nutritional snacks, salty snacks and protein snacks, as well as in the “better-for-you” eating space. 
Intellectual Property
We own numerous domestic and international trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid if they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained. We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets are important to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on a combination of watch services and trademark, copyright, patent, trade dress and trade secret laws, and through the domain name dispute resolution system. We also own virtually all of the recipes and specifications for our products.
10
Competition
The nutritional snacking industry is fragmented and highly competitive and includes a number of diverse competitors. We have a number of diverse competitors of varying sizes and capabilities, including developers, marketers and sellers of other branded and private label nutritional snacking food products. We compete primarily in large retail and e-commerce environments. We believe the principal competitive factors in the nutritional snacking industry are:
•
brand awareness and loyalty among consumers;
•
product ingredients (including the sourcing and allergen profiles of ingredients);
•
macronutrient profiles of products;
•
product claims;
•
product taste and texture;
•
product convenience;
•
advertising campaigns and associated spending;
•
perceived product value
•
product variety, packaging and labeling;
•
access to retailer shelf space; and
•
product positioning on e-commerce retailer sites.
We believe we currently compete effectively with respect to each of these factors. However, a number of companies in the nutritional snacking industry may compete more effectively for a variety of reasons, including having greater financial resources, more comprehensive product lines, broader market presence, more established relationships with distributors, suppliers and customers, longer operating histories, greater distribution and selling capabilities, stronger brand recognition, or greater innovation and marketing capabilities than we have. We expect the industry we operate in to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future.
Supply Chain
We operate an asset-light business model. For the manufacture of our products, we contract with contract manufacturers, and as a result, our operations are highly flexible and require targeted capital expenditures. The supply chain for our international business also uses exclusively contract manufacturers.
Sourcing. 
The principal ingredients to manufacture our products include cocoa and other coatings, dairy, proteins, soy, nuts, and pea and pumpkin seed protein. Our packaging consists of flexible film, cartons, tetra paper, plastic bottles and corrugate. All our core ingredients are purchased according to rigorous standards to assure food quality and safety. These core ingredients are generally available in adequate quantities from several suppliers. We competitively bid with major suppliers to source competitively priced, quality ingredients and packaging that meet our standards. For certain ingredients we establish direct purchasing agreements with suppliers, under which our contract manufacturers source ingredients to produce finished products. We also procure certain ingredients directly that our contract manufacturers then use to produce our products. We actively manage the cost of most of our packaging supplies, such as corrugate, film, and cartons. OWYN directly purchases and owns the ingredients and packaging the contract manufacturers use for the production of selected OWYN products.
Manufacturing. 
We rely on contract manufacturers to manufacture our products. The contract manufacturers schedule and receive ingredient and packaging inventory according to parameters set in their contracts and forecasts we provide. As noted above, some ingredients and packaging are purchased by our contract manufacturers pursuant to framework contracts we have with the applicable suppliers. Our contract manufacturers are regularly audited by third parties and are required to follow rigorous food safety guidelines. We believe our contract manufacturers have capacity to meet our anticipated supply needs, although short-term high demand or production equipment issues can cause disruptions. We monitor both near-term and long-term capacity as well as fulfillment rates and overall performance of our manufacturing partners and qualify alternate suppliers as needed. In general, we purchase finished products from our contract manufacturers, which includes all packaging and ingredients used, as well as an agreed-upon tolling charge for each item produced. These finished products are then shipped directly to our distribution centers, or shipped directly from the contract manufacturer to the customer.
U.S. Storage. 
We lease two distribution centers, both in Greenfield, Indiana, referred to collectively as the Distribution Centers, where we store finished goods. We utilize over 1.6 million square feet of floor space among our Distribution Centers.
Distribution. 
The majority of our products are shipped directly to one of our Distribution Centers, which are leased warehouses managed by a third-party logistics provider. A substantial portion of our inventory is shipped directly to our retailers from our warehouses by the same third-party logistics provider. Most of our remaining customers pick up their orders at our distribution centers and make their own arrangements for delivery to their fulfillment network. For certain customers, some of our products are shipped directly from the contract manufacturer to the customers’ locations. We believe our use of demand forecasting and vendor-managed inventory systems enables us to meet shipping demands, ensure timely delivery of orders and offer service levels to our customers. For the majority of our customers, our logistics provider distributes the finished goods from our Distribution Centers, which first flow through regional terminals. At the terminals, our orders 
11
are consolidated with other companies’ products being shipped to the customer. The finished goods are then distributed to retailer customers’ distribution centers.
International
. Our products are also sold outside North America. Our top international sales are in Australia and New Zealand. For the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, international net sales represented approximately 2.0% of total net sales. For products that are not manufactured in North America and shipped internationally, our international supply chain is run by a lean team solely focused on international operations. Similar to U.S. operations, international operations utilize contract manufacturers for products, and distributors for distribution and sales.
Food Safety and Quality
. 
Food safety and quality is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that consumers receive safe, high quality food products. Our products are manufactured in facilities that have programs and controls in place regarding consistent quality and food safety. Product attributes such as taste, aroma, texture, and appearance are regularly monitored. Good Manufacturing Practices and comprehensive food safety programs are designed to produce a safe, wholesome product. Our suppliers are required to have equally robust processes in place and confirm their compliance with product specifications with Letters of Guaranty and Certificates of Analysis for shipments of core ingredients to be used in our products. Finally, random samples of finished goods are regularly sent to a third-party laboratory for testing. We hold an ISO 22000 certification for our U.S. operations, excluding OWYN, which we first obtained during fiscal year 2022.
Information Technology
We rely heavily on information systems for management of our supply chain, inventory, payment of obligations, collection of cash, human capital management, financial tools and other business processes and procedures. Our ability to manage our business functions efficiently and effectively depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. We have instituted controls, including information technology governance controls that are intended to protect our computer systems and our information technology systems and networks. We also have business continuity plans that attempt to anticipate and mitigate failures. However, we cannot control or prevent every potential technology failure, adverse environmental event, third-party service interruption or cybersecurity risk.
We increasingly rely on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of customer, consumer or employee information on our behalf.
We, along with our third-party service providers including our licensees, contract manufacturers, e-commerce contractors and third-party sellers, collect information about consumers directly from them as well as automatically through their use of our websites. We collect information from consumers when they interact with our websites and the services we offer on those sites. The information we collect varies based on the consumer’s particular interaction with our websites. We may combine this information with other information that we collect. We and our third-party service providers may use cookies and other similar tracking technologies to track information about consumers’ use of our websites and the services we offer on those websites. The website operations of our third parties may be affected by reliance on other third-party hardware and software providers, technology changes, risks related to the failure of computer systems through which these website operations are conducted, telecommunications failures, data security breaches and similar disruptions.
Segments
Following the OWYN Acquisition during the fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, the Company determined its operations are organized into two operating segments, Quest and Atkins, and OWYN, which are aggregated into one reportable segment due to similar financial, economic and operating characteristics. The operating segments are also similar in the following areas: (a) the nature of the products; (b) the nature of the production processes; (c) the methods used to distribute products to customers; (d) the type of customer for the products; and, (e) the nature of the regulatory environment. The Company also designed its organizational structure to support entity-wide business functions across brands, products, customers, and geographic regions. As a result, as of the fifty-two weeks ended August 30, 2025, and fifty-three weeks ended August 31, 2024, the Company determined its operations are organized into two operating segments, which were aggregated into one reportable segment due to similar financial, economic and operating characteristics. As of the fifty-two weeks ended August 26, 2023, the Company determined its operations were organized into one consolidated operating segment and reportable segment.
Regulation and Compliance
Along with contract manufacturers, brokers, distributors, ingredients and packaging suppliers, Simply Good Foods is primarily subject to laws and regulations in the United States promulgated by federal, state and local government authorities. In the United States, the federal agencies governing the manufacture, distribution and advertising of products include, among others, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the FDA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, in addition to similar state and local agencies. Under various statutes, these agencies prescribe the requirements and establish the standards for quality and safety and regulate marketing and advertising to consumers. In certain circumstances, these agencies must not only approve products, but also review the manufacturing processes and facilities used to produce these products before they can be marketed in the United States.
12
Simply Good Foods is subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise. Our operations, and those of our contract manufacturers, distributors, and suppliers, also are subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety matters. We continue to monitor their development and our compliance.
Food-Related Regulations
As a manufacturer and distributor of food products, we are subject to several food-related regulations, including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the FDA. This comprehensive regulatory framework governs the manufacture (including composition and ingredients), labeling, packaging and safety of food in the United States. The FDA:
•
regulates manufacturing practices for foods through its current good manufacturing practices regulations;
•
specifies the standards of identity for certain foods, including many of the products we sell;
•
regulates the advertising claims that can be made on food product labels; and
•
prescribes the format and content of certain information required to appear on food product labels.
We are subject to the Food Safety Modernization Act, which, among other things, mandates that the FDA adopt preventative controls to be implemented by food facilities in order to minimize or prevent hazards to food safety. We are subject to numerous other federal, state and local regulations involving such matters as the licensing and registration of manufacturing facilities, enforcement by government health agencies of standards for our products, inspection of our facilities and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of food products.
Environmental Regulations
We are subject to various state and federal environmental laws, regulations and directives, including the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended. Governments may in the future implement new laws, regulations and directives aimed to meet certain climate change goals and objectives which could affect our business operations as they relate to ingredient and packaging procurement.
We believe that we are in material compliance with existing environmental regulations applicable to our business. We do not expect the cost of our continued compliance with existing environmental regulations to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, cash flows or competitive position in the foreseeable future. In addition, any asset retirement obligations are not material.    
Labeling Regulations
We are subject to various labeling requirements with respect to our products at the federal, state and local levels.

In our normal performance review cycle, which took place in early fiscal year 2025, approximately 99% of our employees held career discussions with their managers to identify opportunities for development and career progression. Because of career discussions, mentorship opportunities and the talent review process conducted by our senior leadership, during fiscal year 2025, we promoted approximately 9% of our workforce and provided associated compensation increases.
Our Inclusion 
&
 Belonging Initiatives (“I
&
B”)
. Our Board of Directors’ Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability committee has been tasked with, among other things, overseeing human capital resources and all our I&B initiatives. These initiatives include the following, among others:
•
In 2022, we established a group focused on building inclusion and belonging named Simply Good People. In its third year, Simply Good People sponsored a number of educational speakers, and created conversation and connection opportunities. Through this, Simply Good People seeks to foster a positive, open, and trusted culture of belonging where every person feels empowered to bring their unique selves to the workplace.
•
We periodically complete pay equity audits to evaluate our pay practices and work to address any issues that may arise.
•
We post every open position or promotional opportunity in the United States that is not confidential, and we include the job’s pay range to provide transparency to candidates. This practice provides every qualified candidate an opportunity to apply with knowledge of the range of pay for the role.
•
All employees are required to attend preventing discrimination and harassment training.

In our hiring, we strive for diversity in experience, which has the power to drive innovation and to encompass a wide variety of perspectives in company decision-making. In addition to our focus on merit-based hiring and promotional opportunities, we believe that attracting and retaining a diverse workforce through an inclusive environment will make us a more desirable workplace and will lead to improved business performance.
Employee Culture
. We regularly ask our employees to respond to engagement surveys to gather feedback on topics including teamwork, growth, job satisfaction, engagement and inclusion. This encourages open communication with employees and management, and tracks employee engagement over time.
Total Rewards.
 The health, satisfaction and security of our employees and their families are important to us and an important part of reaching our organization's goals. We offer total rewards packages that include valuable and competitive compensation and benefit plans. These programs reflect our commitment to attracting and retaining top talent and keeping our staff healthy and secure. Our compensation philosophy is to pay for performance, and we do so through a mix of base salary, annual short-term incentive and long-term incentive. 
We understand that each employee's situation is unique, so we offer benefits that can be shaped and molded by each employee to fit their individual or family's needs. Our current benefits vary by region, but in the U.S. generally include medical, dental and vision insurance, 401(k) retirement plan, savings accounts, life and disability insurance coverage, free mental telehealth support, and other voluntary benefits.
We recognize the importance of balance in our employees’ lives to their overall wellbeing, so we offer our employees time off benefits to recharge, including vacation time, flexible vacation for exempt positions, sick leave, ten company-paid holidays per year, flexible remote workdays every Monday and Friday, and paid parental leave.
Advancing Health, Nutrition and Wellbeing.
 We seek to empower healthy lives through smart and satisfying nutrition. We believe we play an important role in helping to improve nutrition and overall wellness in the United States through scientific research, education, advocacy and community engagement. 
Since 2016, we have advocated with various branches of the U.S. federal government to encourage more inclusive guidance in the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Dietary Guidelines for Americans (the “Dietary Guidelines”), which is released every five years. Our goal is to expand the Dietary Guidelines to offer solutions for more Americans, including the more than half of the U.S. population suffering from negative metabolic-related conditions such as cardiovascular disease, prediabetes, diabetes and obesity. We also believe expanding the Dietary Guidelines would help to address health equity in many underserved populations in the United States who have higher rates of metabolic-related diseases. The advocacy work we have done is aligned with recent guidance issued by major health organizations such as the American Diabetes Association and the American Heart Association, both of which recommend a lower carbohydrate dietary approach as an option for those with diabetes.
Our public policy advocacy includes presenting significant scientific research comprised of several hundred, peer-reviewed clinical studies in numerous meetings with policymakers, congresspeople, and decision-makers in the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In addition, we have sponsored numerous continuing education courses for registered dieticians and other healthcare professionals, and we are a member of multiple collaborative groups focused on improving the nutritional quality of the U.S. food system.
As part of our advocacy on the advantages of a protein-rich, low-carbohydrate, and low-sugar dietary approach, we have devoted portions of our respective brand websites and social media to promote consumer education, engagement, and dialogue about the benefits of our nutritional approaches and how our products can fit within those approaches. Through our websites and social media, we also share educational information to explain each brand’s approach to nutrition, teaching consumers how to make smarter food choices and the nutritional qualities of our approach and products. Our Atkins website also offers free of charge information regarding the Atkins protein-rich, low-carbohydrate and low-sugar approach to eating, and over 1,600 recipes designed to help consumers achieve and maintain a healthy lifestyle, while still enjoying delicious food.
In late 2021, we launched Quest for Impact, formerly known as The Quest Challenge, a grant program for individuals who are making a difference in their community in support of health and wellness. In fiscal year 2025, we provided four separate $20,000 grants. The Quest for Impact grants were awarded following a competitive process in which applicants expressed their current philanthropic work and what they aim to achieve if they received the grant. We will continue to follow the progress of our past recipients and their effect on their communities.
We encourage and support our employees to give back to charities they are passionate about, and we match up to $100 of each employee’s donations. We also offer a Volunteer Time Off policy that reflects our commitment to community responsibility and impact. Through this program, employees are provided with two days of paid time-off each year to volunteer with meaningful causes that strengthen the communities where we live and work, while reinforcing our mission and values.

In May 2024, we announced our partnership with the Boys and Girls clubs of metro Denver to create the Spark and Spoon project. This project will impact over 28,000 kids and teens across Denver, providing them with nutrition education, healthy lifestyle programs, culinary programs, healthy food boxes, field trips, and provide funding for a dedicated full time staff member to support the programs. In July of 2024, Simply Good Foods volunteers assisted with a cooking class, helping the kids learn vital food preparation skills such as chopping, measuring, and mixing as they created three special dishes and enjoyed the “art” of cooking. In our first year, over 300 cooking and nutrition classes were held with over 2,260 club members participating. Our support has enabled the local organization to hire new staff to expand the program and ensure that nutrition programming was available at all 18 clubs in the region. We provided over 3,000 healthy food boxes (45,765 pounds) throughout the year and 540 boxes (8,100 pounds) for the holidays. In addition, we sponsored the development of The Spark & Spoon Project’s “The Family Cookbook” and partnered with a local retail partner to amplify the effect and sales. The Spark & Spoon Project’s “The Family Cookbook,” is a collection of thirty recipes that highlight recipes submitted by club members, highlighting their favorite foods and are representative of their cultural heritage. By encouraging kids to learn about the traditional foods and culinary traditions of their families we aim to improve food and nutrition literacy, which are known determinants of health outcomes later in life.
