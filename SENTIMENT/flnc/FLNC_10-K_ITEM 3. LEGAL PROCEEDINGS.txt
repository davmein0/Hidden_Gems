ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings relating to claims that arise out of our operations and business that cover a wide range of matters, including, but not limited to, intellectual property matters, commercial and contract disputes, insurance and property damage claims, labor and employment claims, personal injury claims, product liability claims, environmental claims and warranty claims. Currently, there are no claims or proceedings against us that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the results of any current or future legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, we may incur significant costs and experience a diversion of management resources as a result of claims and litigation.
For a description of our material pending legal contingencies, please see “Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies”, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
Market Information
Our Class A common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “FLNC” since October 28, 2021. Prior to that date, there was no public market for our Class A common stock. 
Our Class B-1 common stock and Class B-2 common stock are not traded in any public market.
Holders
As of November 19, 2024, there were approximately nine stockholders of record of our Class A common stock, one holder of our Class B-1 common stock, and no holders of our Class B-2 common stock. The actual number of holders of our Class A common stock is greater than this number of record holders and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees. 
Dividends
 We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business, and therefore we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. Holders of our Class B-1 and Class B-2 common stock are not entitled to participate in any dividends declared by our board of directors.
Furthermore, because we are a holding company, our ability to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock depends on our receipt of cash distributions from Fluence Energy, LLC and, through Fluence Energy, LLC, cash distributions and dividends from our other direct and indirect subsidiaries. 
Assuming Fluence Energy, LLC makes distributions out of earnings and profits (other than tax distributions and other distributions to pay expenses) to its members in any given year, we currently expect, subject to the determination of our board of directors, to pay dividends on our Class A common stock out of the portion of such distributions remaining after our payment of taxes, Tax Receivable Agreement payments and expenses, and subject to Delaware law. Our ability to pay dividends was previously restricted by our Revolving Credit Agreement, dated November 1, 2021, which was terminated effective November 22, 2023, was restricted by our ABL Credit Agreement (as defined below), and is currently restricted under our 2024 Credit Agreement, and may similarly be restricted by the terms of any future credit agreement or any future debt or preferred equity securities of us or our subsidiaries. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and subject to compliance with contractual restrictions and covenants in the agreements governing our future indebtedness. Any such determination will also depend upon our business prospects, results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements and availability, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.
Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans 
Information regarding securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans is incorporated herein by reference to Item 12, “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters” of Part III of this Annual Report.
Recent Sales of Unregistered Equity Securities
There were no unregistered sales of our equity securities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, that were not otherwise disclosed in a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or a Current Report on Form 8-K.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
None.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our audited consolidated financial statements and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and the section entitled “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information” and in other parts of this Annual Report. The discussion of changes in our financial condition and results of operations from the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 is included in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023 filed with the SEC on November 29, 2023. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any periods in the future.  
Upon the completion of our initial public offering (the “IPO”) and a series of organization transactions (collectively with the IPO, the “Transactions”) on November 1, 2021, Fluence Energy, Inc. became a holding company whose sole material assets are the limited liability interests in Fluence Energy, LLC (the “LLC Interests”). All of our business is conducted through Fluence Energy, LLC, together with its subsidiaries, and the financial results of Fluence Energy, LLC are consolidated in our financial statements. Except where the context clearly indicates otherwise, “Fluence,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” refers to Fluence Energy, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries.
The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company’s CODM reviews financial information on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates in one operating segment, which corresponds to one reportable segment.
 Our fiscal year begins on October 1 and ends on September 30. References to “fiscal year 2022”, “fiscal year 2023” and “fiscal year 2024” refer to the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively.
Key Components of Our Results of Operations

The following discussion describes certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations and our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).  
Total Revenue

We generate revenue from battery-based energy storage solutions, service agreements with customers to provide operational services related to battery-based energy storage solutions, and from digital application contracts. Fluence enters into contracts with utility companies, developers, and commercial and industrial customers. 
We derive the majority of our revenue from selling battery-based energy storage solutions. Generally, we must design the project, as each energy storage solution is customized depending on a customer’s energy needs, procure the major equipment, obtain manufacturing slots from our contract manufacturers, coordinate the logistics, and assemble the solution prior to delivery and installation at our customer project sites. The Company recognizes revenue over time for our energy storage solutions as we transfer control of our product to the customer. 
Our revenue from selling battery-based energy storage solutions is affected by volume fulfilled, which is dependent on customer schedules and demand, changes in price, which is primarily dependent on the cost of lithium-ion energy storage hardware, and mix of products and solutions purchased by our customers. 
Our revenue growth is directly tied to the continued adoption of energy storage solutions by our customers and our ability to increase our share of demand in the geographic regions where we currently compete and plan to compete in the future, which is driven by the demand for our products, geographic mix of our customers, strength of competitors’ product offerings, and availability of government incentives to the end-users of our products as well as our ability to continue to develop and commercialize new and innovative solutions that address the changing technology and performance requirements of our customers. 
61
Cost of Goods and Services

Cost of goods and services consists primarily of product costs, including purchased materials and supplies, as well as costs related to shipping, customer support, product warranty, and personnel. Personnel costs in cost of goods and services includes both direct labor costs as well as costs attributable to any individuals whose activities relate to the transformation of raw materials or component parts into finished goods or the transportation of materials to the customer. Cost of goods and services are recognized when services are performed or control of goods are transferred to the customers. Standard inventory materials that could be used interchangeably on other projects are included in cost of goods sold when they are integrated into, or restricted to, the production of a customer’s project. 
Our product costs are affected by the underlying cost of raw materials, such as lithium-ion, and components to our solutions including inverters. Our product costs are also affected by technological innovation, economies of scale resulting in lower supply costs, and improvements in production processes and automation. We do not currently hedge against changes in the price of raw materials as we do not directly purchase raw materials; instead, we buy the components of energy storage products from our suppliers and we rely on our suppliers to hedge the underlying raw materials. We generally expect the ratio of cost of goods and services to revenue to decrease as sales volumes increase due to economies of scale, however, some of these costs, primarily personnel-related costs, are not directly affected by sales volume.
Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin

Gross profit and gross profit margin may vary from quarter to quarter and are primarily affected by our volume fulfilled, product prices, and product costs.
Operating Expenses

Operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses as well as depreciation and amortization. Personnel-related expenses are the most significant component of our operating expenses and include salaries, stock-based compensation, and employee benefits. We expect to invest in additional resources to support our growth which will increase our operating expenses in the near future.
Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related costs across our global research and development (“R&D”) centers for engineers engaged in the design and development and testing of our integrated products and technologies and costs of materials and services procured for research and development projects. Engineering competencies include data science, machine learning, software development, network and cyber security, battery systems engineering, industrial controls, UI / UX, mechanical design, power systems engineering, certification, and more. R&D expenses also support three product testing labs located across the globe: a system-level testing facility in Pennsylvania that is used for quality assurance and the rapid iteration, testing, and launching of new Fluence energy storage technology and products, a testing facility located in Erlangen, Germany, and a deployment center located in Long Beach, California. We have established an additional Hardware in the Loop testing facility, which is co-located with our technical team in Bangalore, India. We expect R&D expenses to generally increase in future periods to support our growth and as we continue to invest in R&D activities that are necessary to achieve our technology and product roadmap goals. These expenses may vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue, depending primarily upon when we choose to make more significant investments.
Sales and Marketing Expenses

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, stock-based compensation, employee benefits, and related personnel technology costs, and factoring discounts on receivables sold. We have and intend to continue to expand our sales presence and marketing efforts to additional countries in the future. 
General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, stock-based compensation, and employee benefits, for our executives, finance, human resources, information technology, engineering and legal organizations that do not relate directly to the sales or research and development functions, as well as travel expenses, facilities costs, bad debt expense, and fees for professional services. Professional services consist of audit, legal, tax, insurance, information technology, and other such costs.
62
Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation consists primarily of costs associated with property, plant, and equipment (“PP&E”) and amortization of intangibles consisting of patents, licenses, and developed technology over their expected period of use. We expect that as we increase both our revenues and the number of our general and administrative personnel, we will invest in additional PP&E to support our growth resulting in additional depreciation and amortization. 
Interest Income, net
Interest income, 
net consists primarily of interest income net of interest expense. Interest income consists of interest earned on cash deposits and interest on customer notes receivables. Interest expense consists primarily of interest on borrowings against notes receivable pledged as collateral, unused line fees and commitment fees related to credit facilities, and amortization of debt issuance costs.
O
ther (Income) Expense, net
Other (income) expense, net primarily consists of expense or income from foreign currency exchange gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities, expense due to estimated payments to be made to related parties under the Tax Receivable Agreement, dated October 27, 2021, by and among Fluence Energy, Inc., Fluence Energy, LLC, Siemens Industry, Inc. and AES Grid Stability, LLC (the “Tax Receivable Agreement”), and factoring income from sale of receivables.
Income Tax Expense
We are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income or loss of Fluence Energy, LLC and are taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates. We are also subject to foreign income taxes with respect to our foreign subsidiaries and our expectations are that valuation allowances will be recorded in certain tax jurisdictions. In addition to tax expenses, we also will incur expenses related to our operations, as well as payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which we expect could be significant over time. We will receive a portion of any distributions made by Fluence Energy, LLC. Any cash received from such distributions from our subsidiaries will be first used by us to satisfy any tax liability and then to make payments required under the Tax Receivable Agreement. 

Net Income (Loss)
Net income (loss) may vary from quarter to quarter and is primarily affected by our gross profit and operating expenses as defined above. 

Key Factors, Trends, and Uncertainties Affecting our Performance
We believe that our performance and future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” within this Annual Report. See also subsections “Our Industry and Market Opportunity”, “Our Growth Strategy”, “Manufacturing”, “Supply Chain”, “Government Regulation and Compliance”, and “Competition” under Part I, Item 1. “Business” of this Annual Report for additional discussion of certain key factors, trends and uncertainties that may affect our performance.   
Industry Outlook 
The utility-scale battery storage industry as a whole is witnessing unprecedented growth, fueled by global transitions toward renewable energy, heightened focus on grid resilience, and supportive regulatory frameworks. Deployment of renewable energy resources has accelerated over the last decade. Industry-wide, the push for decarbonization is creating increasing demand for grid-scale energy storage, which is critical to enabling the integration of variable renewable energy sources, reducing the intermittency and volatility of renewable energy generation, and meeting ambitious net-zero targets. BloombergNEF estimates that the global utility scale market, excluding China, will add approximately 2,529 GWh between 2024 and 2035.  
Our revenue growth is directly tied to the continued adoption of energy storage solutions by our customers. One factor that impacts this continued adoption of energy storage solutions is the cost of lithium-ion energy storage hardware.

The cost of lithium-ion energy storage hardware has declined significantly in the aggregate in the last decade and has resulted in a large addressable market today. In fiscal year 2022, we saw prices for lithium-ion battery packs increase from prior years, though prices returned to their historical trend of declining year-over-year in fiscal years 2023 and 2024. The market for energy storage continues to rapidly evolve and while we believe lithium-ion battery pack costs will continue to decline over the long term, there is no guarantee that they will decline or decline at the rates we expect. If costs do not continue to decline long term and instead remain steady or increase, as seen in fiscal year 2022, this could adversely affect our ability to increase our revenue, our order intake, and grow our business. 
63
Overall, we believe Fluence is well-positioned to continue to capitalize on the utility-scale battery storage market as we continue to deliver solutions that address the complex needs of a transforming energy landscape. However, there is no guarantee that the deployment of renewable energy will occur at the rate estimated by BloombergNEF or that such renewable energy will rely on lithium-ion battery technology for energy storage. Macroeconomic uncertainties, supply chain disruptions, geo-political conflicts, government regulations and incentives, and other factors could result in fluctuations in demand for and deployment of renewable energy resources, adversely affecting our revenue and ability to generate profits in the future. See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further discussion on these risks.
Increased Electricity Demand
According to a publication from the Office of Policy of the U.S. Department of Energy in August 2024, electricity demand is forecasted to grow substantially in the United States over the next decade. Electricity demand is expected to be driven primarily by new data centers, artificial intelligence, new manufacturing facilities, and sector-wide

electrification. We are seeing similar trends of increasing electricity demand in other countries, including in those in which we operate. We believe that such increase in electricity demand will cause an increase in demand for our energy storage solutions globally. 
2021 Overheating Event at Customer Facility

On September 4, 2021, a 300 MW energy storage facility owned by one of our customers experienced an overheating event. Fluence served as the energy storage technology provider and designed and installed portions of the facility, which was completed in fiscal year 2021. No injuries were reported from the incident. The facility was taken offline as teams from Fluence, our customer, and the battery designer/manufacturer investigated the incident. Our customer released initial findings in the second fiscal quarter of 2022 on what it contends is the root cause of the incident. The customer’s stated findings, if ultimately confirmed and proven, could relate to certain scopes of work for which Fluence or its subcontractors could be responsible. The customer’s stated findings, however, could also relate to certain scopes of work for which other parties were responsible and/or relate to other causes, including the design and installation of portions of the facility over which Fluence did not have responsibility or control. The customer has alleged that Fluence is liable for the incident. At this time, Fluence cannot accept the customer’s stated findings and has denied liability. No formal legal proceedings have been commenced, but it is reasonably possible that litigation may result from this matter if a resolution cannot be achieved. Any such dispute would also likely include claims by Fluence and counterclaims by the customer relating to disputed costs arising from the original design and construction of the facility. The customer announced in July of 2022 that a large portion of the facility was back online. We are currently not able to estimate the impact, that this incident may have on our financial results. To date, we do not believe that this incident has impacted the market’s adoption of our products and solutions. 
2023 Project-Related Litigation
In October 2023, Fluence filed a complaint in the Superior Court of California, Contra Costa County, against Diablo Energy Storage, LLC, Empire Business Park, LLC, the Bank of New York Mellon and others, seeking approximately $37.0 million in damages arising from the supply and construction of an energy storage facility for the defendants, including for the defendants’ nonpayment of contractual amounts owed. On or about November 10, 2023, Defendant Diablo Energy Storage, LLC filed a cross-complaint against Fluence, seeking a minimum of $25.0 million of alleged damages and disgorgement of all compensation received by Fluence for the project, in the amount of approximately $230.0 million. The disgorgement claim was based upon an alleged deficiency in Fluence’s contractor license. Fluence denies the allegations in the cross-complaint and intends to vigorously defend against them and to enforce our claims against the defendants. We are currently not able to estimate the impact, if any, that this litigation may have on our reputation or financial results, or on market adoption of our products.

Deployed
Deployed represents cumulative energy storage products and solutions that have achieved substantial completion and are not decommissioned. Deployed is monitored by management to measure our performance towards achieving project milestones.
Assets Under Management
Assets under management for service contracts represents our long-term service contracts with customers associated with our completed energy storage system products and solutions. We start providing maintenance, monitoring, or other operational services after the storage product projects are completed. In some cases, services may be commenced for energy storage solutions prior to achievement of substantial completion. This is not limited to energy storage solutions delivered by Fluence. Assets under management for digital software represents contracts signed and active (post go live). Assets under management serves as an indicator of expected revenue from our customers and assists management in forecasting our expected financial performance.
65
Contracted Backlog 
For our energy storage products and solutions contracts, contracted backlog includes signed customer orders or contracts under execution prior to when substantial completion is achieved. For service contracts, contracted backlog includes signed service agreements associated with our storage product projects that have not been completed and the associated service has not started. For digital applications contracts, contracted backlog includes signed agreements where the associated subscription has not started.
We cannot guarantee that our contracted backlog will result in actual revenue in the originally anticipated period or at all. Contracted backlog may not generate margins equal to our historical operating results. We have only recently begun to track our contracted backlog on a consistent basis as performance measures, and as a result, we do not have significant experience in determining the level of realization that we will achieve on these contracts. Our customers may experience project delays or cancel orders as a result of external market factors and economic or other factors beyond our control. If our contracted backlog fails to result in revenue as anticipated or in a timely manner, we could experience a reduction in revenue, profitability, and liquidity.
Contracted/Order Intake
Contracted, which we use interchangeably with “order intake”, represents new energy storage product and solutions contracts, new service contracts. and new digital contracts signed during each period presented. We define “Contracted” as a firm and binding purchase order, letter of award, change order, or other signed contract (in each case an “Order”) from the customer that is received and accepted by Fluence. Our order intake is intended to convey the dollar amount and gigawatts (operating measure) contracted in the period presented. We believe that order intake provides useful information to investors and management because the order intake provides visibility into future revenue and enables evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s sales activity and the attractiveness of its offerings in the market. 
Pipeline

Pipeline represents our uncontracted, potential revenue from energy storage products and solutions, service, and digital software contracts, which have a reasonable likelihood of contract execution within 24 months. 
Pipeline is an internal management metric that we construct from market information reported by our global sales force. 
Pipeline is monitored by management to understand the anticipated growth of our Company and our estimated future revenue related to customer contracts for our battery-based energy storage products and solutions, services, and digital software. 
We cannot guarantee that our pipeline will result in actual revenue in the originally anticipated period or at all. Pipeline may not generate margins equal to our historical operating results. We have only recently begun to track our pipeline on a consistent basis as performance measures, and as a result, we do not have significant experience in determining the level of realization that we will achieve on these contracts. Our customers may experience project delays or cancel orders as a result of external market factors and economic or other factors beyond our control. If our pipeline fails to result in revenue as anticipated or in a timely manner, we could experience a reduction in revenue, profitability, and liquidity.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This section contains references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Margin, and Free Cash Flow. 
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated from the consolidated statements of operations using net income (loss) adjusted for (i) interest income, net, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) stock-based compensation, and (v) other non-recurring income or expenses. Adjusted EBITDA also includes amounts impacting net income related to estimated payments due to related parties pursuant to the Tax Receivable Agreement. 
Adjusted Gross Profit is calculated using gross profit, adjusted to exclude (i) stock-based compensation expenses, (ii) amortization, and (iii) other non-recurring income or expenses. Adjusted Gross Profit Margin is calculated using Adjusted Gross Profit divided by total revenue.
Free Cash Flow is calculated from the consolidated statements of cash flows and is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, less purchase of property and equipment made in the period. We expect our Free Cash Flow to fluctuate in future periods as we invest in our business to support our plans for growth. Limitations on the use of Free Cash Flow include (i) it should not be inferred that the entire Free Cash Flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures (for example, cash is still required to satisfy other working capital needs, including short-term investment policy, restricted cash, and intangible assets); (ii) Free Cash Flow has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities; and (iii) this metric does not reflect our future contractual commitments.
66
These non-GAAP measures are intended as supplemental measures of performance and/or liquidity that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe that such non-GAAP measures, when read in conjunction with our operating results presented under GAAP, can be used to better assess our performance from period to period and relative to performance of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing methods, historical cost basis or capital structure.
These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities. Readers are cautioned that these non-GAAP measures should not be construed as alternatives to other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures and their reconciliation to GAAP financial measures are shown below. 
The following tables present our non-GAAP measures for the periods indicated.

Total Revenue

Total revenue increased by $480.6 million, or 21.7%, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The increase was mainly attributable to (i) the expansion of sales of our battery-based energy storage solutions by $454.6 million primarily driven by increased volumes of Gridstack cubes fulfilled and (ii) an increase of services revenue primarily due to additional battery-based energy storage products and solutions being deployed and transitioned to assets under management and increases in augmentation activities performed for certain projects.
Costs of Goods and Services

Cost of goods and services increased by $280.5 million, or 13.5%, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cost of goods and services for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to (i) the increase of volume of Gridstack cubes fulfilled, (ii) a corresponding increase in services costs related to the increases in services revenue described above, and (iii) the favorable settlement of contractual claims with our largest battery module vendor of $19.5 million that had occurred in the prior period, which had the effect of reducing our costs, but did not reoccur in the current period. The overall increase in cost of goods and services was less than the increase in revenue during fiscal year 2024 due to net improvement of gross margins on portfolio of newer Gridstack solutions projects during the current period due to operational efficiencies.
Gross Profit and Gross Profit Margin
Gross profit increased by $200.1 million, or 142%, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the net improvement of gross margins on the portfolio of newer Gridstack solutions projects in the current period due to operational efficiencies described above in “Costs of goods and services.”
Research and Development Expenses 
Research and development expenses were relatively flat in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.
68
Sales and Marketing Expenses

Sales and marketing expenses increased by $22.7 million, or 55.3%, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The increase in sales and marketing expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to (i) a $15.6 million increase in salaries and personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation and information technology costs related to personnel, due to an increase in headcount to support our growth, and (ii)  a $2.1 million factoring discount on sale of accounts receivable under the Master Receivables Purchase Agreement (“MRPA”) recorded in the current period.
General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses increased by $36.7 million, or 26.9%, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a $38.8 million increase in salaries and personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to higher headcount to support our growth, partially offset by a net decrease in other general and administrative expenses.
Depreciation and Amortization 
Depreciation and amortization increased by $1.6 million, or 16.2%, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, primarily attributable to a $1.2 million cumulative adjustment in depreciation recognized in June 2024 resulting from changing the useful life of IT equipment from five years to three years.

Interest income
, net was relatively flat in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.
Other

Other income, n
et increased by $0.3 million, or 4.7%, in
 the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the fiscal year ende
d September 30, 2023. The increase in other income, net was primarily attributable to the factoring income of $2.1 million from sale of accounts receivable under the MRPA offset by an increase in expense of $1.5 million due to change in estimated payments due to related parties under the Tax Receivable Agreement. 
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense increased by $4.7 million, or 102.4%, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The increase in tax expense is primarily due to increases in foreign pre-tax book income and U.S. tax on foreign earnings in fiscal year 2024, partially offset by the release of valuation allowances. 
Net Income (Loss)
Net income increased by $135.2 million, or 129.0%, in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to increase in “gross profit,” partially offset by increases in operating expenses as described above. 
Comparison of the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2023 to the Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2022
For a discussion of our results of operations for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, please see Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on November 29, 2023.  
Liquidity and Capital Resources

Since inception and through September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were the proceeds from our IPO, our cash and cash equivalents from operations, short-term borrowings, borrowings available under our debt agreements, supply chain financing, capital contributions from AES Grid Stability, Siemens Industry, and
 proceeds from the investment by QIA Florence Holdings, LLC, an affiliate of QIA in 2021,
 proceeds from short-term investments, and borrowings against note receivables and proceeds from sale of accounts receivable under the MRPA. 
     We believe the proceeds received from our IPO, our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, sales of accounts receivable under the MRPA, borrowings against note receivables and availability under our 2024 Revolver will be sufficient to meet our expense and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months following the filing of this Annual Report.
69
Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the timing and extent of our growth initiatives, our introduction of new products, services, and digital application offerings, and overall regulatory and economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and cash requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in additional dilutions to our stockholders. The incurrence of additional debt financing would result in debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, operations, and financial condition.
On November 1, 2021, upon the closing of our IPO, we received net proceeds of $935.8 million. 
The net proceeds from the IPO were used to purchase 35,650,000 newly issued LLC Interests directly from Fluence Energy, LLC. Fluence Energy, LLC used the net proceeds from the sale of LLC Interests to Fluence Energy, Inc. to repay all outstanding borrowings relating to a line of credit and promissory notes. The remainder of the proceeds has been and continues to be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 
Pr
ior to the IPO, the Company had an Uncommitted Line of Credit Agreement (“Line of Credit’) with Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) which allowed us to borrow an amount in aggregate not to exceed $50.0 million, with the expiration date on March 31, 2023. Outstanding borrowings from the Line of Credit were $50.0 million as of September 30, 2021. The weighted average annual interest rate of the borrowing was 2.83%
. 
On November 1, 2021, the $50.0 million outstanding borrowings from the Line of Credit was paid off using the proceeds from our IPO and the Line of Credit was canceled shortly thereafter.
Additionally, prior to the IPO, we funded our liquidity through borrowings from AES Grid Stability and Siemens Industry. On August 11, 2021, Fluence Energy, LLC entered into a promissory note with each of Siemens Industry and AES Grid Stability, under which Fluence Energy, LLC received a bridge financing of an aggregate of $50.0 million. In connection with the bridge financing, Fluence Energy, LLC issued a $25.0 million promissory note to each of Siemens Industry and AES Grid Stability (together, the “Promissory Notes”). The Promissory Notes bore interest at a rate of 2.86%. The Promissory Notes were repaid on November 1, 2021 using proceeds from the IPO.
We have provided certain of our suppliers with access to a supply chain financing program through a third-party financing institution (the “SCF Bank”). This program allows us to seek extended payment terms with our suppliers and allows our suppliers to monetize their receivables prior to the payment due date, subject to a discount. Once a supplier elects to participate in the program and reaches an agreement with the SCF Bank, the supplier elects which individual invoices to sell to the SCF Bank. We then pay the SCF Bank on the invoice due date. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable to the SCF Bank. The agreements between our suppliers and the SCF Bank are solely at their discretion and are negotiated directly between them. Our suppliers’ ability to continue using such agreements is primarily dependent upon the strength of our financial condition and guarantees issued by AES and Siemens. As of September 30, 2024, AES and Siemens each have outstanding issued guarantees of $50.0 million each, for a total of $100.0 million, to SCF Bank on our behalf. As of September 30, 2024
, 
two
 suppliers were actively participating in the supply chain financing program, and we h
ad $81.3 
million of payables outstanding subject to the prog
ram. All outstanding payments owed under the program are recorded within “Accounts payable” in our consolidated balance sheets.
On August 11, 2023, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC which became effective upon filing and will remain effective for three years from the effectiveness date. The Form S-3 allows us to offer and sell from time-to-time Class A common stock, preferred stock, depository shares, debt securities, warrants, purchase contracts or units comprised of any combination of these securities for our own account and allows certain selling stockholders to offer and sell up to 135,666,665 shares of Class A common stock in one or more offerings. The Form S-3 is intended to provide us flexibility to conduct registered sales of our securities, subject to market conditions and our future capital needs. The terms of any future offering under the shelf registration statement will be established at the time of such offering and will be described in a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC prior to the completion of any such offering.
Revolving Credit Facility
We entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement for a revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”) on November 1, 2021, by and among Fluence Energy, LLC, as the borrower, Fluence Energy, Inc., as a parent guarantor, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto, and JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent. The aggregate amount of commitments was $200.0 million. The Revolver was originally scheduled to mature on November 1, 2025. The Revolving Credit Agreement was terminated effective November 22, 2023, in conjunction with the entry into the ABL Credit Agreement (as further described below), and at such time, the Company prepaid all amounts outstanding under the Revolver and terminated all commitments thereunder. No penalties were required to be paid as a result of the termination.
For further discussion of the Revolver, refer to “Note 12 - Debt” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
70
Asset-Based Lending Facility
On November 22, 2023, the Company entered into an asset-based syndicated credit agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”) by and among Fluence Energy, LLC, as parent borrower, Fluence Energy, Inc., as parent, the other borrowers party thereto, the other guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto (the “ABL Lenders”), and Barclays Bank PLC (“Barclays”), as administrative agent, which was amended by the Master Assignment and Assumption and Issuing Bank Joinder, effective December 15, 2023 (the “ABL Joinder”), Amendment No. 1, dated April 8, 2024 (“Amendment No. 1”), and Amendment No. 2, dated May 8, 2024 (“Amendment No. 2”), which provided for revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million (the "ABL Facility"). The ABL Facility was secured by (i) a first priority pledge of Fluence Energy, Inc.’s equity interests in Fluence Energy, LLC and (ii) first priority security interests in, and mortgages on, substantially all tangible and intangible personal property and material fee-owned real property of  Fluence Energy, Inc., Fluence Energy, LLC, and Fluence Energy Global Production Operation, LLC, in each case, subject to customary exceptions and limitations. Borrowings under the ABL Facility were scheduled to mature, and lending commitments thereunder would terminate, on November 22,
 2027, which remains the maturity date of borrowings under the 2024 Revolver.
As of the time of our entry into Amendment No. 3 to the ABL Credit Agreement (as discussed below), there were no outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility or letters of credit outstanding.
For further discussion of the ABL Credit Agreement, refer to “Note 12 - Debt” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
2024 Revolver 
On August 6, 2024 (the "Amendment Effective Date"), Fluence Energy, Inc. entered into Amendment No. 3 to the ABL Credit Agreement (such agreement, as amended, the "2024 Credit Agreement") in order to (i) convert the existing ABL Facility to a senior secured cash flow revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $500.0 million (the "2024 Revolver"), (ii) replace Barclays as administrative agent under the 2024 Credit Agreement with Citibank, N.A., and (iii) make certain other modifications to the 2024 Credit Agreement as set forth therein. Capitalized terms used in this subsection that are not otherwise defined in this subsection are defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement.
The 2024 Revolver is secured by (i) a first priority pledge of the Company's equity interests in Fluence Energy, LLC and Fluence Energy Global Production Operation, LLC, (ii) first priority security interests in substantially all tangible and intangible personal property of the Company, Fluence Energy, LLC, Fluence Energy Global Production Operation, LLC and certain of its foreign subsidiaries, in each case, subject to customary exceptions and limitations, and (iii) a pledge of the Company's equity interests in certain of its foreign subsidiaries and security interests in certain assets of such foreign subsidiaries.
The 2024 Credit Agreement sets forth that (i) loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus 2.00%, (ii) loans comprising each Term Benchmark Borrowing shall bear interest at the Term SOFR Rate or the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, as applicable, plus 3.00%, and (iii) the loans comprising each RFR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Daily Simple RFR plus 3.00%, in each instance subject to customary benchmark replacement provisions including, but not limited to, alternative benchmark rates, customary spread adjustments with respect to borrowings in foreign currencies and benchmark replacement conforming changes. Fluence Energy, LLC is required to pay to the lenders a commitment fee on the average daily unused portion of the commitments through maturity, which shall accrue at the rate of 0.50% per annum. The 2024 Credit Agreement provides for a cash draw sublimit of $150.0 million as well as a letter of credit sublimit in the amount of $500.0 million if certain conditions are met. 
The 2024 Credit Agreement contains customary covenants for this type of financing, including, but not limited to, covenants that restrict our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to: incur indebtedness; incur liens; sell, transfer, or dispose of property and assets; make investments or acquisitions; pay dividends, make distributions or other restricted payments; and engage in affiliate transactions. The 2024 Credit Agreement limits our ability to make certain payments, including dividends and distributions on Fluence Energy, LLC's equity, the Company's equity, and other restricted payments. Under the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement, Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries are currently limited in their ability to pay cash dividends to, lend to, or make other investments in the Company, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, we are required to maintain (i) from the Amendment Effective Date through December 31, 2025, Total Liquidity of no less than $150,000,000 at any time, (ii) from January 1, 2026 and thereafter, Total Liquidity of no less than $100,000,000 at any time or a Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the last day of any Measurement Period not to exceed 3.50:1.00, and (iii) certain other financial requirements at each Guarantor Coverage Test Date. S
uch covenants are tested on a quarterly basis and upon the occurrence of other certain restricted payments, the incurrence of indebtedness, certain dispositions, and other specified transactions. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all such covenants.
If an event of default occurs with respect to a borrower, the lenders will be able to, among other things, terminate the commitments immediately, cash collateralize any outstanding letters of credit, declare any
 loans outstanding to be due and payable in whole or in part, and exercise other rights and remedies. The maturity date and the date of termination of lending commitments under the 2024 Credit Agreement remain unchanged at November 22, 2027. 
As of September 30, 2024, there are no cash borrowings under the 2024 Revolver, and there are $74.9 million letters 
of credit outstanding under the 2024 Revolver, with remaining availability of $425.1 million, net of letters of credit issued.  
71
Borrowings Against Note Receivable - Pledged as Collateral
In December 2022, we transferred $24.3 million in customer receivables to Standard Chartered Bank (“SCB”) in the Philippines for proceeds of $21.1 million. The receivables all related to our largest customer in that country. The underlying receivables transferred were previously aggregated into a long term note, with interest, with a maturity date of September 30, 2024. In April 2023, we aggregated and transferred an additional $30.9 million in receivables into a second long term note with the same customer to SCB for proceeds of $27.0 million, upon substantially similar terms as the December 2022 transfer and with a maturity date of December 27, 2024. These transactions are treated as secured borrowings as we did not transfer the entire note receivables due from the customer to SCB. We continue to receive quarterly interest income from the customer, while SCB is responsible for collecting payments on the principal balances which represent the initial receivable balances from the customer. We have no other continuing involvement or exposure related to the underlying receivables. On September 16, 2024, the $24.3 million of receivables were paid in full, resulting in release of the corresponding note and borrowing. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded net interest incom
e of
 $0.3 million, which represents the net of $4.4 million in interest income and $4.1 million in interest expense recor
ded in “Interest income, net.” As of September 30, 2023, the Company recorded net interest income of $1.0 million, which represents the aggregate of $3.4 million in interest income and $2.4 million in interest expense. 
Sale of Receivables under Master Receivables Purchase Agreement
On February 27, 2024, Fluence Energy, LLC entered into the MRPA, by and among Fluence Energy, LLC and any other seller from time to time party thereto, as sellers and servicers, and Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank ("CACIB"), as purchaser, of certain receivables on an uncommitted basis. The MRPA provides that the outstanding amount of all purchased receivables under the MRPA will not exceed $75.0 million, with sublimits for each account debtor and for certain kinds of receivables. The MRPA may be terminated by either party at any time by 30 days’ prior written notice. Fluence Energy, LLC has granted CACIB a security interest in the purchased receivables, and proceeds thereof, as more fully described in the MRPA, in order to perfect CACIB’s ownership interest in the purchased receivables and secure the payment and performance of all obligations of Fluence Energy, LLC to CACIB under the MRPA. The MRPA contains other customary representations and warranties and covenants.
When receivables are sold under the MRPA, they are sold without recourse, and our continuing involvement is limited to their servicing, for which the Company receives a fee commensurate with the service provided and therefore no servicing asset or liability related to these receivables was recognized for any period presented. The fair value of the sold receivables approximated their book value due to their short-term nature.
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, we sold receivables to CACIB under the MRPA for net proceeds of $71.5 million. At the date of the true sale, the receivables were de-recognized in their entirety from the consolidated balance sheets. We charged a fee to our customer, primarily for providing extended payment terms, in relation to the sale of receivables. We recorded factoring income of $2.1 million and related factoring discount of $2.1 million during the period. The factoring income is recorded in “Other (income) expense, net” and the factoring discount is recorded in “Sales and marketing expense” on the consolidated statements of operations. Proceeds from the sold receivables are reflected in operating cash flows on the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Tax Receivable Agreement
In connection with the IPO, we entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with Fluence Energy, LLC and Siemens Industry and AES Grid Stability (together, the “Founders”). Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, we are required to make cash payments to the Founders equal to 85% of the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in certain circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of (1) the increases in our share of the tax basis of assets of Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries resulting from any redemptions or exchanges of LLC Interests from the Founders and certain distributions (or deemed distributions) by Fluence Energy, LLC; and (2) certain other tax benefits arising from payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The payment obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement is an obligation of Fluence Energy, Inc. and not of Fluence Energy, LLC. We expect to use distributions from Fluence Energy, LLC to fund any payments that we will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement. To the extent we are unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement resulting in the acceleration of payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Fluence Energy, Inc. expects to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash tax benefits, if any, it realizes from such tax benefits. For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, the cash tax benefits will be computed by comparing the actual income tax liability of Fluence Energy, Inc. to the amount of such taxes that Fluence Energy, Inc. would have been required to pay had there been no such tax basis adjustments of the assets of Fluence Energy, LLC or its subsidiaries as a result of redemptions or exchanges and had Fluence Energy, Inc. not entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement.
Redemptions or exchanges of LLC Interests post-IPO are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the assets of Fluence Energy, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries. Increases in tax basis and tax basis adjustments generated over time may increase (for tax purposes) the depreciation and amortization deductions available to Fluence Energy, Inc. and, therefore, may reduce the amount of U.S. federal, state, and local tax that Fluence Energy, Inc. would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the IRS may 
72
challenge all or part of the validity of that tax basis, and a court could sustain such a challenge. Fluence Energy, Inc.’s allocable share of tax basis and the anticipated tax basis adjustments upon redemptions or exchanges of LLC Interests may also decrease gains (or increase losses) on future dispositions of certain assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those assets. Actual tax benefits realized by Fluence Energy, Inc. may differ from tax benefits calculated under the Tax Receivable Agreement as a result of the use of certain assumptions in the Tax Receivable Agreement, including the use of an assumed state and local income tax rate to calculate tax benefits. The payment obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement is an obligation of Fluence Energy, Inc. and not of Fluence Energy, LLC. We expect to use distributions from Fluence Energy, LLC to fund any payments that we will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement. To the extent we are unable to make timely payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments generally will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid; provided, however, that nonpayment for a specified period may constitute a material breach of a material obligation under the Tax Receivable Agreement resulting in the acceleration of payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Fluence Energy, Inc. expects to benefit from the remaining 15% of cash tax benefits, if any, it realizes from such tax benefits. For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, the cash tax benefits will be computed by comparing the actual income tax liability of Fluence Energy, Inc. to the amount of such taxes that Fluence Energy, Inc. would have been required to pay had there been no such tax basis adjustments of the assets of Fluence Energy, LLC or its subsidiaries as a result of redemptions or exchanges and had Fluence Energy, Inc. not entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement. The actual and hypothetical tax liabilities determined in the Tax Receivable Agreement will be calculated using the actual U.S. federal income tax rate in effect for the applicable period and an assumed state and local income tax rate (along with the use of certain other assumptions). The term of the Tax Receivable Agreement will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired, unless Fluence Energy, Inc. exercises its right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early, certain changes of control occur or Fluence Energy, Inc. breaches any of its material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, in which case, all obligations generally (and in the case of such a change of control or such breach, only if the Founders elect) will be accelerated and due as if Fluence Energy, Inc. had exercised its right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement. The payment to be made upon an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally equal the present value of payments to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement using certain assumptions. Estimating the amount of payments that may be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement is by its nature imprecise, insofar as the calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of factors. The tax basis adjustments upon the redemption or exchange of LLC Interests, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of purchases or exchanges, the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the purchase or exchange, the extent to which such purchases or exchanges do not result in a basis adjustment, the amount of tax attributes, changes in tax rates and the amount and timing of our income. 
On June 30, 2022, Siemens Industry, Inc. exercised its redemption right pursuant to the terms of LLC

Agreement with respect to its entire holding of 58,586,695 LLC Interests of Fluence Energy, LLC, together with the corresponding cancellation of an equivalent number of shares of Class B-1 common stock of Fluence Energy, Inc., par value $0.00001 per share. 
 On December 8, 2023, AES Grid Stability exercised its redemption right pursuant to the terms of the LLC Agreement with respect to 7,087,500 LLC Interests of Fluence Energy, LLC, together with the corresponding cancellation of an equivalent number of shares of Class B-1 common stock of Fluence Energy, Inc., par value $0.00001 per share (the “AES Redemption” and, together with the Siemens Redemptions, the “Siemens and AES Redemptions”). The Siemens and AES Redemptions resulted in increases in the tax basis of the assets of Fluence Energy, LLC and certain of its subsidiaries. The increases in tax basis and tax basis adjustments increases (for tax purposes) the depreciation and amortization deductions available to Fluence Energy, Inc. and, therefore, may reduce the amount of U.S. federal, state, and local tax that Fluence Energy, Inc. would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the IRS may challenge all or part of the validity of that tax basis, and a court could sustain such a challenge.
As a result of the tax basis adjustment of the assets of Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries upon the Siemens Redemption and our possible utilization of certain tax attributes, the payments that we may make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial. The Redemptions will result in future tax savings of $126.4 million. Siemens and AES will be entitled to receive payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement equaling 85% of such amount, or $107.4 million; assuming, among other factors, (i) we will have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the tax benefits; (ii) Fluence Energy, LLC is able to fully depreciate or amortize its assets; and (iii) no material changes in applicable tax law. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not conditioned upon continued ownership of us by the Founders. Although the timing and extent of future payments could vary significantly under the Tax Receivable Agreement for the factors discussed above, we anticipate funding payments from the Tax Receivable Agreement from cash flow from operations of our subsidiaries, available cash or available borrowings under any future debt agreements, and such payments are not anticipated to be dependent upon the availability of proceeds of the IPO. We recorded $1.5 million of Tax Receivable Agreement payment to related party expense for the 2024 tax year. The payment will be finalized after the filing of the Fluence Energy, Inc. U.S. income tax return during the year-ending September 30, 2025. 
With the exception of the $1.5 million of Tax Receivable Agreement payment recorded as of September 30, 2024, we determined it is not probable additional payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement would be made, given there is no expectation of future sufficient taxable income over the term of the agreement to utilize deductions in the future. Therefore, the Company has not recognized additional liability, outside of the $1.5 million. Should we determine that the Tax Receivable Agreement payment is probable, a corresponding liability will be recorded and as a result, our future results of operations and earnings could be impacted as a result of these matters.

Credit Support and Reimbursement Agreement

We are party to an Amended and Restated Credit Support and Reimbursement Agreement, dated June 9, 2021, with AES and Siemens Industry (the “Credit Support and Reimbursement Agreement”) whereby they may, from time to time, agree to furnish credit support to us in the form of direct issuances of credit support to our lenders or other beneficiaries or through their lenders’ provision of letters of credit to backstop our own facilities or obligations. Pursuant to the Credit Support and Reimbursement Agreement, if AES or Siemens Industry agree to provide a particular credit support (which they are permitted to grant or deny in their sole discretion), they are entitled to receipt of a credit support fee, reimbursement of actual costs and expenses incurred in having a credit support instrument issued and maintained, and reimbursement for all amounts paid to our lenders or other counterparties, payable upon demand. The Credit Support and Reimbursement Agreement initially expires on June 9, 2025 (the “initial expiration date”), and will automatically and indefinitely continue after such date; except that either AES or Siemens Industry is permitted to terminate the agreement effective at any time on or after the initial expiration date by providing not less than six months prior notice. Any credit support under the Credit Support and Reimbursement Agreement will remain in effect after any such termination until such credit support has been replaced by the Company.
Currently, the Company has outstanding performance guarantees provided by AES and Siemens Industry and their respective affiliates that guarantee Fluence’s performance obligations under certain contracts with Fluence’s customers.  These performance guarantees are issued pursuant to the terms of the Credit Support and Reimbursement Agreement. Fluence paid performance guarantee fees to its affiliates in exchange for guaranteeing Fluence’s performance obligations under certain contracts with Fluence’s customers. The guarantee fees are included in “Costs of goods and services” on Fluence’s consolidated statements of operations. Guarantees are also issued by AES and Siemens, pursuant to the terms of the Credit Support and Reimbursement Agreement, in connection with the supplier chain financing program. 
Commitments, Guarantees, Letter of Credits, Surety Bonds, and other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding bank guarantees, parent guarantees, letters of credit, and surety bonds issued as performance security arrangements for a large number of customer projects. 
 In addition, we have a limited number of parent company guarantees issued as payment security to certain vendors. 
The Company also has certain battery purchase obligations and spending requirements under our master supply agreement with suppliers. We are also party to both assurance and service-type warranties for various lengths of time. Refer to “Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information regarding our contingent obligations, including off-balance sheet arrangements and legal contingencies.

Net cash flows provided by operating activities was $79.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $111.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, representing a change of $191.6 million in net cash provided by operating activities. The change was mainly due an increase of $135.2 million in net income and improvement in cash provided by working capital balances of $37.8 million. The details of cash provided by (used in) operations for each period are described below:
Net cash flows provided by operating activities of $79.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to (i) net income of $30.4 million (ii) increases in accounts payable of $370.1 million due to the timing, as compared to fiscal year 2023, payments to various vendors, and (iii) net positive effects of changes in current accruals and provisions of $160.2 million. These cash inflows were partially offset by (i) deferred revenue, inclusive of related parties decreasing in aggregate by $82.0 million, and (ii) receivables, inclusive of trade, unbilled accounts receivable and related parties increasing in aggregate by $393.8 million, due to timing of various customer project billings and cash collections in accordance with contract milestone payment schedules. 
Net cash flows used in operating activities of $111.9 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, were primarily due to (i) net loss of $104.8 million, (ii) decreases in accounts payable of $242.3 million due to timing of purchases and payments to various vendors (iii) deferred revenue, inclusive of related parties decreasing in aggregate by $198.4 million, due to timing of various customer project billings and cash collections in accordance with contract milestone payment schedules. These cash outflows were offset  by positive effects of utilization of inventory of $432.8 million.
74
Net cash flows used in investing activities were $19.0 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 which were primarily due to capital expenditures on software of $10.9 million and purchases of property and equipment of $8.1 million. Net cash flows provided by investing activities were $94.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 which were primarily due to $111.7 million from proceeds from maturities of short-term investments, offset by $5.0 million in payments for purchase of investment in joint venture, $9.2 million in capital expenditures on software, and $3.0 million in purchases of property and equipment.
Net cash flows used in financing activities were $8.7 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, which were primarily related to (i) $8.5 million in payments related to debt issuance costs for the ABL Facility and 2024 Revolver, (ii) $3.9 million in payments for a previously acquired company (Nispera), and (iii) $1.7 million related to Class A common stock withheld related to settlement of employee taxes for stock-based compensation awards, partially offset by $5.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options during the period. Net cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 of $52.6 million were primarily driven by $48.2 million in proceeds from the borrowing against note receivable - pledged as collateral and $7.2 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $2.8 million in cash outflows related to Class A common stock withheld related to settlement of employee taxes for stock-based compensation awards. 
Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates

Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In the preparation of these financial statements, we consider an accounting judgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates, and assumptions could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates. 
Revenue Recognition - Sale of Energy Storage Products and Solutions
The Company enters into contracts with utility companies, developers, and commercial and industrial customers to design and build battery-based energy storage products. Our projects have a lead time from date of contract execution to substantial completion, typically ranging from approximately twelve up to eighteen months. Generally, we must design the project, as each storage solution is customized depending on the customer’s energy needs, procure the major equipment, obtain manufacturing slots from our contract manufacturers, coordinate the logistics, and assemble the solution prior to delivery and installation at our customer project sites. These actions must be completed timely to adhere to customer schedules and milestones. Depending on the scope of the project we may be responsible for the installation of the equipment. After the equipment is installed, we are responsible for commissioning. The Company recognizes revenue over time as we transfer control of our product to the customer. This transfer of control to the customer occurs as the project is being built in accordance with the contract or is supported by clauses in the contracts that provide enforceable rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date for products that do not have an alternative use to the Company. Revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion (“POC”) method based on actual cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs. Standard inventory materials (including batteries, enclosures, chillers, and others, which are assembled into “cubes”) that could be used interchangeably on other projects are included in our measure of progress when they are integrated into, or restricted to a specific customer’s project such that we no longer have the ability to direct their use for other purposes. Contract costs include all direct material and labor costs related to contract performance. As the cost of the assembled cubes comprise a substantial portion of the total estimated contract costs, our pattern of revenue recognition may vary materially from period to period. Our judgement on when costs should be included in the measure of progress has a material impact on revenue recognition. 
Since the revenue recognition of these contracts depends on estimates, which are assessed continually during the term of the contract, recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. The cumulative effects of revisions of estimated total contract costs and revenues, together with any contract reserves which may be deemed appropriate, are recorded in the period in which they occur. Due to the uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that these estimates will be revised in a different period.
The Company determines the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received which includes estimates of variable consideration that are included in the transaction price in accordance with ASC 606. The transaction price identified is allocated to each distinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service based on the relative standalone selling prices. For our energy storage products and solutions, services, and digital applications contracts where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract or we sign separate contracts at or near the same time with the same customer that meet the criteria for combination, the Company allocates the transaction price to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin taking into consideration pricing history and market factors. Generally, our revenues recognized are not sensitive to the Company’s determination of standalone selling prices.
We assess any variable consideration using an expected value method which computes a weighted average amount based on a range of potential outcomes. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Estimating variable consideration requires certain estimates and assumptions, including whether and by how much a project will be delayed or if we will not meet certain performance specifications per the contract.
75
Our contracts generally provide our customers the right to liquidated damages (“LDs”) against Fluence in the event specified milestones are not met on time or equipment is not delivered according to contract specifications. Liquidated damages are accounted for as variable consideration and the contract price is reduced by the expected LD amount when recognizing revenue. The existence and measurement of LDs may also be impacted by our judgments about the probability of favorable outcomes of customer disputes involving whether certain events qualify as force majeure or the reason for the events that caused project delays. Variable consideration for liquidated damages is estimated using the expected value method.
Fluence may incur additional costs to execute on the performance of a contract. When this happens, we typically attempt to recover these costs via a change order with the customer. When this fact pattern occurs, it can create a timing difference between when we have incurred the cost versus when we record the proportionate revenue, since costs are recognized immediately when incurred and the revenue is recognized based upon the transaction price, which is usually increased upon signing a respective change order with the customer. 
When shipping and handling activities are performed after the customer obtains control of the product, we elect to account for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the product.
Revenue is recorded net of any taxes assessed on and collected from customers, which are remitted to the governmental authorities.
Customer payments are due upon meeting certain milestones as defined in the contract, which are generally consistent with contract-specific phases of a project.
Pre-contract costs with no future benefit are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.  
Refer to “Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of other accounting policies and estimates including income taxes, goodwill, and loss contracts. 
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with our business or with an existing or forecasted financial transactions. We are exposed to various market risks in the ordinary course of our business which are discussed below. We monitor our underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt any hedging or related market risk strategies as needed. The disclosures presented in this Item 7A are based upon a number of assumptions; actual effects may differ. The safe harbor provided in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act shall apply to the disclosures contained in this Item 7A. For further information regarding market risk, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” titled “
Significant changes in the cost and/or availability of raw materials and components that are incorporated into our energy storage products could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and future prospects,” and “We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could negatively affect our operating results”, and “An increase in interest rates or a reduction in the availability of tax equity or project debt capital or project financing in the global financial markets could make it difficult for end customers to finance the cost of a renewable energy storage system and could reduce the demand for our energy storage solutions”.
Credit Risk

Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty may default on its contractual obligations resulting in a loss to us. Our counterparties for sale of our energy storage solutions and delivery service are customers including conglomerates, utilities / load-serving entities, independent power producers, developers, and C&I customers in the United States and other countries. A loss of one or more of our significant customers, including AES and its affiliates, their inability to perform under their contracts, or their default in payment could harm our business and negatively impact revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. Credit policies have been approved and implemented to govern our portfolio of counterparties with the objective of mitigating credit losses. These policies establish guidelines, controls, and limits to manage credit risk within approved tolerances by mandating an appropriate evaluation of the financial condition of existing and potential counterparties, monitoring agency credit ratings, and by implementing credit practices that limit exposure according to the risk profiles of the counterparties. In addition, customers are required to make milestone payments based on their project’s progress. We may also, at times, require letters of credit, parent guarantees, cash collateral, or other credit support when deemed necessary. 
Our overall exposure may be affected positively or negatively by macroeconomic factors or regulatory changes that impact our counterparties to one extent or another. Currently, management does not anticipate a material adverse effect in our financial position or results of operations as a consequence of counterparty non-performance. We continuously monitor the creditworthiness of all our counterparties. 
76
Foreign Currency Risk

Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, while certain of our current subsidiaries have other functional currencies, reflecting their principal operating markets. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Euro, the British pound, the Australian dollar, the Canadian Dollar, and the Swiss Franc in our current foreign markets could create significant fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. We use foreign currency forward contracts and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to the foreign currency impact of intercompany sales of inventory to regional entities by our centralized procurement entity. To date, we have not had material exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, and a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the value of the U.S. dollar would not have a material effect on our operating results.
Commodity Price Risk

We are subject to risk from fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials, including steel, aluminum and lithium, that are used in the components from suppliers that are inputs into our products. Prices of these raw materials may be affected by supply restrictions or other logistic costs market factors from time to time. As we are not the direct buyer of these raw materials, we do not enter into hedging arrangements to mitigate commodity risk. Significant price changes for these raw materials could reduce our operating margins if suppliers increase component prices and we are unable to recover such increases from our customers and could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
Interest Rate Risk
During fiscal year 2024, we were exposed to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under the Revolver and the ABL Facility, which bore interest at floating rates.  In addition, we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under the 2024 Revolver, which bears interest at floating rates. Effective November 22, 2023, we terminated the Revolver and entered into the ABL Credit Agreement, under which borrowings bore a variable interest rate based on the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, or Adjusted Daily Compounded CORRA Rate, plus applicable margin depending on available excess availability (each as defined in the ABL Credit Agreement). Effective August 6, 2024, we entered into the 2024 Credit Agreement, under which borrowings bear a variable interest rate based on the Alternate Base Rate, Term SOFR Rate, Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, or Daily Simple RFR, plus applicable margin (each as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement). As of September 30, 2024, there are no cash borrowings
 under the 2024 Revolver.

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Fluence Energy, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fluence Energy, Inc. (the Company) as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity, members’ equity (deficit) and mezzanine equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, the related notes and the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 8 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 29, 2024 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Revenue Recognition – Transfer of Control
Description of the Matter
As described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized $2,648 million of revenue from the sale of battery-based energy storage solutions. Revenue from these sales is recognized over time, using the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs. Standard inventory materials (including batteries, enclosures, chillers, and others, which are assembled into “cubes”) that could be used interchangeably on other projects are included in the measure of progress when they are integrated into, or restricted to, the specific customer project. Due to the significance of the costs associated with cubes, the inclusion of such costs in the measure of progress has a material impact on revenue recognition. 
Auditing the Company’s revenue recognition required a high degree of auditor judgment and more extensive audit procedures due to the complexity involved in determining whether the costs associated with cubes are appropriately included in the measure of progress in the Company’s percentage of completion calculation. 
79
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
To evaluate whether costs associated with cubes were appropriately included in the measure of progress when revenue was recognized, our audit procedures included, among others, selecting a sample of customer contracts and reviewing them, including any change orders, to understand the terms impacting when the cubes were integrated into or restricted to the customer’s project. We also obtained confirmation from customers of the contractual terms as well as the timing and quantity of cubes delivered, and, in the absence of an executed change order, that the customer had requested delivery to an alternate location and had accepted legal title to the cubes. Additionally, we inspected the cubes at a sample of the customers’ locations. In order to verify the completeness and accuracy of the Company’s records, we also inspected shipping documents and obtained confirmation of the quantity and timing of cube shipments to customer locations directly from the Company’s contract manufacturers.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Fluence Energy, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Fluence Energy, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Fluence Energy, Inc. (the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management’s assessment. Management has identified a material weakness in controls related to the Company’s revenue recognition process. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2024 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated November 29, 2024, which expressed an unqualified opinion thereon
.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates
Principles of Accounting and Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) and under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
“SEC”).

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Fluence Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Non-Controlling Interest
92
As the sole managing member of Fluence Energy, LLC, Fluence Energy, Inc. operates and controls all the business and affairs of Fluence Energy, LLC and, through Fluence Energy, LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, conducts the Co
mpany’s business. Fluence Energy, LLC is a variable interest entity, of which Fluence Energy, Inc. beneficially owns a 
71.53
% interest as of September 30, 2024. 
For accounting purposes, Fluence Energy, Inc. is considered the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates the results of Fluence Energy, LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries.

The table below summarizes the ownership structure at the end of each respective period:

Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Items subject to such estimates and assumptions include: the relative fair value allocations to contingencies with multiple elements, the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of long-lived assets; impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, and long-lived assets; valuation allowances for inventories; deferred tax assets; revenue recognized under the percentage-of-completion method; transaction price estimates with variable consideration; accrued bonuses; and various project related provisions including, but not limited to, estimated losses and warranty obligations.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on-hand and highly liquid investments readily convertible to cash, with an original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased.
Cash restricted for use as a result of financing or other obligations is classified separately as restricted cash. If the purpose of restricted cash relates to acquiring a long-term asset, liquidating a long-term liability, or is otherwise unavailable for a period longer than one year from the balance sheet date, the restricted cash is included in “other non-current assets.” Otherwise, restricted cash is included as a separate line item on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. 
 The Company typically retains cash for operations within one or more bank accounts. These accounts may hold cash in excess of the FDIC limit of $250,000. As a result, we are subject to concentration risk associated with the underlying custodial banks with whom deposits of cash and cash equivalents in excess of the FDIC limits are held. If access to these accounts is delayed or suspended indefinitely, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations required for operations.
The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at the end of each respective period as shown in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

Receivables
Trade receivables represent actual billings that are generally due within 30 days from the invoice date, and do not bear interest. Unbilled receivables represent the excess of revenues recognized over billings to date on certain contracts. Receivables are carried at amounts billed, less any reserves for credit losses, if any. The Company periodically assesses collectability of accounts receivable and records an expected credit loss for the estimated uncollectible amount when deemed appropriate. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, reserve for credit losses was approximately $
2.9
 million and $
0.2
 million, respectively.
 Advances are given to suppliers based on the contract terms of respective agreements and are presented on a separate line on the consolidated balance sheets. These advances are recovered through the receipt of goods and services mainly used in the production of energy storage products.
Leases
The Company accounts for its leases in accordance with ASC 842, 
Leases
. The Company leases offices, land, warehouses, and equipment. Leases are categorized at their commencement date and lease-related assets and liabilities are recognized for all leases with an initial term of 12 months or greater. The Company evaluates renewal options at commencement and on an ongoing basis and includes options that are reasonably certain to exercise in its expected lease terms when classifying leases and measuring lease liabilities. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is used to determine the present value of the lease payments over the lease term for leases, as these leases typically do not have a stated borrowing rate. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
 Refer to “Note 8 - Leases” in these consolidated financial statements for our policies and disclosures related to leases.
Foreign Currency Transactions
An entity’s functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates and is generally the currency in which the entity generates and expends cash. The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. For all Fluence subsidiary entities whose functional currency is not in U.S. Dollar, the balance sheet and income statement are translated into US Dollar using the ending balance sheet rate and weighted average rate, respectively. Translation adjustments are included as a separate component on the consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss), and in “Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents” on the consolidated statement of cash flows. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary entity. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in “Other (income) expense, net” in the consolidated statements of operations.

Business Combinations
A business combination is an acquisition of a business from an entity not under common control and is accounted for using the acquisition method. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other net assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. Fair value measurements may require us to make significant estimates and assumptions. A measurement period, which could be up to one year from the date of the acquisition, exists to identify and measure the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. During the measurement period, provisional amounts may be recognized, and those amounts may subsequently be prospectively adjusted to reflect any new information about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of these amounts. At the end of the measurement period, any subsequent changes would not be recognized under the acquisition method but would instead follow other accounting principles, which would generally impact earnings.
Collaborative Arrangements
Under ASC 808, 
Collaborative Arrangements
, a collaboration arrangement exists when the parties, who are active participants in a joint operating activity, are exposed to significant risks and rewards. In September 2020, Fluence entered into a supply agreement with a battery manufacturer to design, develop, manufacture and sell a lithium-ion battery module and related system. Under the agreement, Fluence has the right to further develop and sell certain intellectual property that will be developed under the arrangement and owned by the manufacturer in exchange for royalty payments. Further, the manufacturer has the right to further develop and sell certain intellectual property that will be developed and owned by Fluence in exchange for royalties payable to Fluence. Development costs paid by Fluence to the manufacturer are presented as
 “
Research and development expenses.” Purchases of batteries under the supply agreement will be presented as “Inventory” and “Cost of goods and services.” Royalties payable to the manufacturer are due upon resale to customers and will be presented as
 “
Cost of goods and services.” Royalties due to Fluence will be presented as “Other (income) expense, net.” Fluence

Revenue and Cost Recognition
The Company’s revenue recognition policy included herein is based on the application of ASC 606. As of September 30, 2024, the Company’s revenue was generated primarily from sale of energy storage products and solutions, providing operational services related to energy storage products, and digital applications. We may refer to our energy storage products as “energy storage solutions” throughout these consolidated financial statements and use this term interchangeably as it is more reflective of the full offering available and provided to our customers. 
Revenue from Sale of Energy Storage Products and Solutions:
 The Company enters into contracts with utility companies, developers, and commercial and industrial customers to design and build battery-based energy storage products. Our projects have a lead time from date of contract execution to substantial completion, typically ranging from approximately twelve up to eighteen months. Generally, we must design the project, as each storage solution is customized depending on the customer’s energy needs, procure the major equipment, obtain manufacturing slots from our contract manufacturers, coordinate the logistics, and assemble the solution prior to delivery and installation at our customer project sites. These actions must be completed timely to adhere to customer schedules and milestones. Depending on the scope of the project we may be responsible for the installation of the equipment. After the equipment is installed, we are responsible for commissioning. The Company recognizes revenue over time as we transfer control of our product to the customer. This transfer of control to the customer occurs as the project is being built in accordance with the contract or is supported by clauses in the contracts that provide enforceable rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date for products that do not have an alternative use to the Company. Revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion (“POC”) method based on actual cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs. Standard inventory materials (including batteries, enclosures, chillers, and others, which are assembled into “cubes”) that could be used interchangeably on other projects are included in our measure of progress when they are integrated into, or restricted to a specific customer’s project such that we no longer have the ability to direct their use for other purposes. Contract costs include all direct material and labor costs related to contract performance. As the cost of the assembled cubes comprise a substantial portion of the total estimated contract costs, our pattern of revenue recognition may vary materially from period to period.  Our judgement on when costs should be included in the measure of progress has a material impact on revenue recognition. 
Since the revenue recognition of these contracts depends on estimates, which are assessed continually during the term of the contract, recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. The cumulative effects of revisions of estimated total contract costs and revenues, together with any contract reserves which may be deemed appropriate, are recorded in the period in which they occur. Due to the uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that these estimates will be revised in a different period.
The Company determines the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received which includes estimates of variable consideration that are included in the transaction price in accordance with ASC 606. The transaction price identified is allocated to each distinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service based on the relative standalone selling prices. For our energy storage products and solutions, services, and digital applications contracts where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract or we sign separate contracts at or near the same time with the same customer that meet the criteria for combination, the Company allocates the transaction price to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin taking into consideration pricing history and market factors. Generally, our revenues recognized are not sensitive to the Company’s determination of standalone selling prices.
We assess any variable consideration using an expected value method which computes a weighted average amount based on a range of potential outcomes. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved. Estimating variable consideration requires certain estimates and assumptions, including whether and by how much a project will be delayed or if we will not meet certain performance specifications per the contract.
Our contracts generally provide our customers the right to liquidated damages (“LDs”) against Fluence in the event specified milestones are not met on time or equipment is not delivered according to contract specifications. Liquidated damages are accounted for as variable consideration and the contract price is reduced by the expected LD amount when recognizing revenue. The existence and measurement of LDs may also be impacted by our judgments about the probability of favorable outcomes of customer disputes involving whether certain events qualify as force majeure or the reason for the events that caused project delays. Variable consideration for LDs is estimated using the expected value method. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, transaction prices have been reduced to reflect estimates of variable consideration primarily related to LDs
 of 
$
78.4
 million
 an
d $
84.1
 million, respectively. 
Fluence may incur additional costs to execute on the performance of a contract. When this happens, we typically attempt to recover these costs via a change order with the customer. When this fact pattern occurs, it can create a timing difference between when we have incurred the cost versus when we record the proportionate revenue, since costs are recognized immediately when incurred and the revenue is recognized based upon the transaction price, which is usually increased upon signing a respective change order with the customer. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized $
11.0
 million and $
26.3
 million, respectively, in revenue from changes in transaction prices during the period, in which the performance obligations were substantially satisfied in previous periods.
When shipping and handling activities are performed after the customer obtains control of the product, we elect to account for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the product.
95
Revenue is recorded net of any taxes assessed on and collected from customers, which are remitted to the governmental authorities.
Customer payments are due upon meeting certain milestones as defined in the contract, which are generally consistent with contract-specific phases of a project.
Pre-contract costs with no future benefit are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.  
Revenue from Services:
 The Company also enters into long-term service agreements with customers to provide operational services related to battery-based energy storage products and solutions. The services include extended warranty, maintenance, monitoring, and other services. The Company accounts for the services as separate performance obligations from the battery-based energy storage products and solutions. The extended warranty services are typically considered a separate performance obligation from the maintenance, monitoring and other services. We typically recognize revenue ratably over the terms of the services using a straight-line recognition method. The Company believes using a time-based method to measure progress is appropriate as the performance obligations are satisfied evenly over the terms of services. Revenue is recognized for each of the performance obligations by dividing the allocated transaction price over the service period.
Some of the agreements also provide a commitment to perform augmentation activities which would typically be represented by installation of additional batteries, and other components as needed, to compensate for partially lost capacity due to degradation of batteries over time. The obligation to perform augmentation activities can take the form of either maintaining battery capacity above a given threshold for a stated term while others provide a fixed number of augmentations over a contract term. Augmentation arrangements that require us to maintain battery capacity above an established thresholds for a given term may be considered service-type warranties depending on the contract terms. These represent a stand-ready obligation in which the customer benefits evenly overtime, of which we recognize revenue for these arrangements using a straight-line recognition method. Alternatively, augmentation arrangements that require us to perform a fixed number of augmentations over a contract term follow the percentage of completion revenue recognition method. Since these arrangements require a fixed number of augmentati
ons we must perform, we use the pattern of cost as a proxy to identify when our obligations are satisfied and to recognize revenue.
Revenue from Digital Applications
: The Company provides access to proprietary cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) offerings through several market facing applications. These applications currently include Fluence Mosaic and Fluence Nispera. Fluence Mosaic is an intelligent bidding software for utility-scale storage and renewable assets, helping to enable customers to optimize asset trading in wholesale electricity markets. Fluence Mosaic is currently available in the NEM (Australia), CAISO (California), and ERCOT (Texas) markets. Fluence Nispera is an asset performance management software that helps customers monitor, analyze, forecast, and optimize the performance of their renewable energy assets. Fluence Nispera is an AI-driven utility-scale asset performance management platform that supports portfolios of energy storage, solar, and wind assets. Customers do not receive legal title or ownership of the applications as a result of these arrangements. The use of the Fluence digital software applications is separately identifiable from other promises that the Company offers to its customers. As such, Fluence digital applications are accounted for as separate performance obligations when combined with other Fluence products, solutions, and services. We consider access to the platform and related support services in a customer contract to be a series of distinct services which comprise a single performance obligation because they are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer. We recognize revenue over time using a straight-line recognition method. 
Deferred Revenue:
 Deferred revenue represents the excess billings to date over the amount of revenue recognized to date. The timing and the amount we bill our customer is based on achieving milestones as defined in the contract with the customer. 
Loss Contracts:
 A contract becomes a loss contract when its estimated total costs are expected to exceed its total revenue. The Company accrues the full loss expected in the period a loss contract is identified which is recorded in “Accruals and provisions” and “Cost of goods and services” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations, respectively.
Cost of Goods and Services:
 Cost of goods and services consists primarily of product costs, including purchased materials and supplies, as well as costs related to shipping, customer support, product warranty and personnel. Personnel costs in cost of goods and services includes both direct labor costs as well as costs attributable to any individuals whose activities relate to the transformation of raw materials or component parts into finished goods or the transportation of materials to the customer. Cost of goods and services are recognized when services are performed, or control of goods are transferred to the customers. Standard inventory materials that could be used interchangeably on other projects are included in cost of goods sold when they are integrated into, or restricted to, the production of the customer’s project.
Inventory, Net
Inventory primarily consists of cubes, batteries and related equipment, enclosures, inverters, and spare parts which are used in ongoing battery storage product and solutions projects. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost being determined by the specific identification method. Costs include cost of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The Company periodically reviews its inventory for potential 
96
obsolescence and write down of its inventory, as appropriate, to net realizable value based on its assessment of usefulness and marketability conditions.
Software Development Costs
Our software development costs primarily relate to 
three
 categories: (i) internal-use software development costs, (ii) hosting arrangements which are service contracts, and (iii) external-use software development costs. We capitalize costs incurred to purchase or develop software for internal use and software to be sold or leased externally.
Internal-use software development costs are capitalized during the application development stage in accordance with ASC 350-40, 
Internal-Use Software
. These capitalized costs are reflected in “Intangible assets, net” on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. Our internal-use software relates to our (i) SaaS customer offerings and is amortized to “Cost of goods and services” and (ii) internally developed solutions and are amortized to “Depreciation and amortization.” The useful life of our internal-use software development costs is generally 
3
 to 
5
 years.
As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company capitalized $
8.9
 million and $
6.4
 million, respectively, of internal-use software.
Internal-use software development costs associated with hosting arrangements are capitalized during the application development stage. These are generally cloud-computing arrangements that are service contracts. The capitalized costs are reflected in “Other non-current assets” on the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to “General and administrative” once ready for intended use over the estimated useful life of the hosted software. The useful life of our internal-use software development costs associated with hosting arrangements is generally the period the Company expects to benefit from its right to access the hosted software plus consideration for any renewal or cancellation periods.
As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company capitalized $
37.4
 million and $
0.0 million
, respectively, of development costs related to hosting arrangements.
External-use software development costs developed to be sold or leased externally are capitalized upon the establishment of technological feasibility for a product in accordance with ASC 985-20, 
Software to be Sold or Leased Externally
. These software development costs are reflected in “Intangible assets, net” on our consolidated balance sheets and amortized to “Cost of goods and services” on a product basis by the greater of the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the product or the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product. The useful life of our external-use software development costs is generally 
5
 years.
As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company capitalized $
2.3
 million and $
3.3
 million, respectively, of external-use software.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company evaluates the recoverability of its property and equipment and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. The assets are considered impaired when their future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value and fair value is less than their carrying value. Impairment charges are calculated as the difference between the discounted expected future cash flows, or other accepted valuation techniques to determine fair value, and the assets’ carrying amount at the date of the triggering event.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are stated at their historical cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses include research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, and depreciation and amortization. Research and development expenses consist of personnel-related costs across our global research and development (“R&D”) centers for engineers engaged in the design and development and testing of our integrated products and technologies and costs of materials and services procured for research and development projects. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, stock-based compensation, employee benefits and factoring discounts on receivables sold. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including salaries, stock-based compensation, and employee benefits, for our executives, finance, human resources, information technology, engineering and legal organizations that do not relate directly to the sales or research and development functions. General and administrative expenses also consist of travel expenses, facilities costs, information technology costs, bad debt expense, and fees for professional services. Professional services consist of audit, legal, tax, insurance, information technology, and other costs. Depreciation consists of costs 
97
associated with property, plant, and equipment (“PP&E”) and amortization of intangibles consisting of patents, licenses, and developed technology over their expected period of use.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
 Advertising expenses were $
3.3
 million, $
1.4
 million, and $
1.4
 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022 respectively.
Income (Loss) per Share 
As of September 30, 2024, the Company has 
three
 classes of common stock, Class A, Class B-1 and Class B-2. Income (loss) per share is calculated and reported under the “two-class” method. The “two-class” method is an earnings allocation method under which income (loss) per share is calculated for each class of common stock considering both distributions declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all such income (loss) had been distributed during the period. 
Basic income (loss) per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to Class A common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted income (loss) per share of Class A common stock is computed by adjusting the net income (loss) available to Class A common stockholders and the weighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding to give effect to potentially dilutive securities. Shares of our Class B-1 and Class B-2 common stock are not entitled to receive any distributions or dividends. When a common unit of Fluence Energy, LLC is redeemed for cash or Class A common stock by a Founder who holds shares of our Class B-1 or Class B-2 common stock, such Founder will be required to surrender a share of Class B-1 or Class B-2 common stock, as the case may be, which we will cancel for no consideration. In the event of cash settlement, the Company is required to issue new shares of Class A common stock and use the proceeds from the sale of these newly-issued shares of Class A common stock to fully fund the cash settlement. Therefore, we did not include shares of our Class B-1 or Class B-2 common stock in the computation of basic income (loss) per share. In periods where we have a loss, diluted loss per share is equal to basic loss per share because the effect of potentially dilutive securities would be antidilutive.
The following table presents the potentially dilutive securities outstanding for each period that were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share:

In October 2021, the existing limited liability company agreement of Fluence Energy, LLC was amended and restated which recapitalized all existing interests in the Company on the basis of a 
14.79
-for-1 split. All shares and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the recapitalization for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated.
All earnings or loss prior to and up to November 1, 2021, the date of completion of the IPO, were entirely allocable to non-controlling interest and, as a result, loss per share information is not applicable for reporting periods prior to this date. Consequently, only the net income (loss) allocable to Fluence Energy, Inc. from the period subsequent to November 1, 2021 is included in the net income (loss) attributable to the stockholders of Class A common stock for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Basic and diluted income (loss) per share of Class A common stock for the periods presented has been computed as follows, where income (loss) represents the numerator and weighted-average shares represent the denominator:

Income Taxes
Fluence Energy, LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As such, the members are individually liable for their own distributable share of taxable income or loss. After our IPO, we are now subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income or loss of Fluence Energy, LLC, and we will be taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates.
We will continue to be subject to foreign income taxes with respect to our foreign subsidiaries. Foreign subsidiaries of the Company account for income taxes and the related accounts in accordance with ASC 740, 
Income Taxes
. Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
The Company recognizes the tax benefits from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. 
The preparation of income tax returns requires the use of management’s estimates and interpretations which may be subjected to review by the respective taxing authorities and may result in an assessment of additional taxes, penalties, and interest.

Fair Value Measurements
The fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The following fair value hierarchy, defined by ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements
, is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used to value the assets and liabilities: 
Level 1—Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Level 2—Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Level 2 inputs include those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted prices, time value, volatility factors, and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.
99
Level 3—Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value from the perspective of a market participant. The Company does not have significant recurring Level 3 fair value measurements.
The Company’s cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments readily convertible to cash, with an original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased. Fair value of cash equivalents approximates the carrying amount. The carrying amounts of trade receivables, accounts payable and short-term debt obligations such as current portion of borrowings against note receivable - pledged as collateral, approximate fair values due to their short maturities.
The fair value of the Company’s foreign currency derivatives is measured on a recurring basis by comparing the contracted forward exchange rate to the current market exchange rate. The foreign currency derivatives are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, as the inputs to the derivative pricing model are generally observable and do not contain a high level of subjectivity. Refer to “Note 21 – Derivatives and Hedging” for details regarding the Company’s derivatives and hedging activities.
Short-term Investments and Marketable Securities: We obtain pricing from level 1 inputs which includes information from quoted market prices, pricing vendors or quotes from brokers/dealers. We conduct reviews of our primary pricing vendors to determine whether the inputs used in the vendor’s pricing processes are deemed to be observable. The fair value of U.S. Treasury securities and government-related securities, corporate bonds and notes and common stock is generally determined using standard observable inputs, including reported trades, quoted market prices, matrix pricing, benchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets and/or benchmark securities. Marketable securities are presented on the balance sheets at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of these securities is included in “Other (income) expense, net” in the accompanying statements of operations.

The table below represents activity on the investments for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Derivatives and Hedging
The Company records all derivatives at their gross fair values on the consolidated balance sheets. The accounting for the gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivatives, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.
Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. The gains or losses from designated cash flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The gains or losses will be presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. The effectiveness of cash flow hedges is assessed at inception and quarterly thereafter. The change in fair value of the components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current period earnings. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting are recognized in current period earnings.
Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  
Accounts payable with related parties of $
2.5
 million and Accruals with related parties of $
3.7
 million as of September 30, 2023, were reclassified from Deferred revenue and payables with related parties to Accounts payable and Accruals and provisions, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet. The reclassification had no impact on the total current liabilities for any period presented. Corresponding reclassifications were also reflected on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. The reclassifications had no impact on cash provided by (used in) operations for the period presented. 
Provision on loss contracts, net of $
6.1
 million and $

Remaining performance obligations
The Company’s remaining performance obligations (“backlog”) represent the unrecognized revenue value of its contract commitments, which include deferred revenue and amounts that will be billed and recognized as revenue in future periods. The Company’s backlog may vary significantly each reporting period based on the timing of major new contract commitments and the backlog may fluctuate with currency movements. In addition, the Company’s customers have the right, under some circumstances, to ter
minate contracts or defer the timing of its services and their payments to the Company.
103
As of September 30, 2024, the Company
 had $
4.5

Business Combination
During April 2022, the Company entered into a share sale purchase agreement and acquired all outstanding shares, the assets and assumed the liabilities of Nispera AG (“Nispera”), a Zurich based provider of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning-enabled SaaS targeting the renewable energy sector. Nispera’s advanced technology helps customers monitor, analyze, forecast, and optimize the performance and value of renewable energy assets. The preliminary base purchase price for the acquisition was $
33.4
 million, of which $
27.1
 million was paid in cash to investors and $
2.6
 million was paid to debt holders at the purchase date. The remaining $
3.7
 million of the purchase price was paid to investors 
18
 months from date of purchase, which occurred in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024. In addition, Fluence issued 
531,202
 shares of restricted stock to Nispera’s management team that vest ratably over 
three years
 for retention purposes and is accounted for as stock compensation. The acquisition represents a business combination under ASC 805 
Business Combinations.
 The Company has included the financial results of the acquisition in its consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Transaction costs associated with the acquisition were not significant and were expensed as incurred. 
The following table summarizes the final aggregate fair values and estimated useful lives of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as of the date of the acquisition.

The fair value of developed technology was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method as developed technology is considered to be the primary revenue-generating identifiable intangible asset acquired in the acquisition. The fair value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions. 
The goodwill is primarily attributed to the expanded market opportunities when integrating the acquired entity’s technology with the Company’s technology and the assembled workforce. The excess of the acquisition price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded to goodwill. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.  
The valuation was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in certain assumptions used to determine the fair value of intangible assets acquired. 
The allocation of fair value of purchase consideration was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2022, and there were no material changes to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as previously reported.

Leases
ASC 842 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception. A lease exists when a contract conveys to the customer the right to control the use of an identified asset 
105
for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The definition of a lease embodies two conditions: (1) there is an identified asset in the contract, and (2) the customer has the right to control the use of the identified asset. Lessees are required to classify leases as either finance or operating leases. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
The Company’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities primarily relate to offices and warehouses. The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of 
one year
 to 
ten years
. The Company’s leases are all classified as operating leases. Certain of the Company’s leases contain renewal, extension, or termination options. The Company assesses each option on an individual basis and will only include options reasonably certain of exercise in the lease term. The Company generally considers the base term to be the term provided in the contract. None of the Company’s lease agreements contain material options to purchase the leased property, material residual value guarantees, or material restrictions or covenants.
The Company does not recognize a lease liability or right-of-use asset on the balance sheet for short-term leases. Instead, the Company recognizes short-term lease payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. A short-term lease is defined as a lease that, at the commencement date, has a lease term of 12 months or less and does not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. Leases (with terms greater than twelve months) are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company generally uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date to calculate the present value of future lease payments. Certain leases include payments that are based solely on an index or rate. These variable lease payments are included in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability and are initially measured using the index or rate at the lease commencement date. Other variable lease payments, such as payments based on use and for property taxes, insurance, or common area maintenance that are based on actual assessments are excluded from the ROU asset and lease liability and are expensed as incurred. In addition to the present value of the future lease payments, the calculation of the ROU asset also includes adjustments for lease incentives, deferred rent, lease prepayments and initial direct costs of obtaining the lease, such as commissions.
Certain lease contracts contain nonlease components such as maintenance and utilities. The Company has made an accounting policy election, as allowed under ASC 842-10-15-37, to capitalize both the lease component and nonlease components of its contracts as a single lease component for its right-of-use assets. This election applies at the asset class level.

Debt
Revolving Credit Facility
On November 1, 2021, 
the Company entered into a credit agreement for a revolving credit facility (the “Revolver”), by and among Fluence Energy, LLC, as borrower, Fluence Energy, Inc., as parent guarantor, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto and JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent (as amended, the “Revolving Credit Agreement”). The Revolver was secured by a (i) first priority pledge of the equity securities of Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries and (ii) first priority security interests in, and mortgages on, substantially all tangible and intangible personal property and material fee-owned real property of Fluence Energy, LLC, the parent guarantor and each subsidiary guarantor party thereto, in each case, subject to customary exceptions and limitations. The aggregate amount of commitments was $
200.0
 million. The Revolving Credit Agreement was terminated effective November 22, 2023, in conjunction with the entry into the ABL Credit Agreement (as further described below).  
108
The Revolving Credit Agreement provided that borrowings under the Revolver bore interest at (i) with respect to loans comprising a Term Benchmark Borrowing, the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, or the AUD Rate, as applicable, plus 
3.0
%, (ii) with respect to loans comprising an ABR Borrowing, the Alternate Base Rate plus 
2.0
%, or (iii) with respect to each RFR Loan, the applicable Daily Simple RFR plus 
3.1193
%, in each instance subject to customary benchmark replacement provisions. Fluence Energy, LLC was required to pay to the lenders a commitment fee of 
0.55
% per annum on the average daily unused portion of the revolving commitments through maturity. The Revolver also provided for up to $
200.0
 million in letter of credit issuances, which required customary issuance and administration fees, as well as a fronting fee payable to each issuer thereof and a letter of credit participation fee of 
2.75
% per annum payable to the lenders. 

Capitalized terms used in this paragraph that are not otherwise defined were defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement.

Asset-Based Lending Facility
On November 22, 2023, the Company entered into an asset-based syndicated credit agreement (the “ABL Credit Agreement”) by and among Fluence Energy, LLC, as parent borrower, Fluence Energy, Inc., as parent, the other borrowers party thereto, the other guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto (the “ABL Lenders”), and Barclays Bank PLC (“Barclays”), as administrative agent, which was amended by the Master Assignment and Assumption and Issuing Bank Joinder, effective December 15, 2023 (the “ABL Joinder”), Amendment No. 1, dated April 8, 2024 (“Amendment No. 1”), and Amendment No. 2, dated May 8, 2024 (“Amendment No. 2”), which provided for revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $
400.0
 million (the "ABL Facility"). The ABL Facility was secured by (i) a first priority pledge of Fluence Energy, Inc.’s equity interests in Fluence Energy, LLC and (ii) first priority security interests in, and mortgages on, substantially all tangible and intangible personal property and material fee-owned real property of  Fluence Energy, Inc., Fluence Energy, LLC, and Fluence Energy Global Production Operation, LLC, in each case, subject to customary exceptions and limitations. Borrowings under the ABL Facility were scheduled to mature, and lending commitments thereunder would terminate, on November 22,
 2027.  
Borrowing availability under the ABL Facility was determined by a borrowing base calculation based on specified percentages of U.S. eligible inventory, net orderly liquidation value of most recent inventory appraisal, and U.S. eligible in-transit inventory, as well as potential borrowing base qualified cash, less the aggregate amount of any reserves. Borrowing base qualified cash was defined as the lesser of (a) the aggregate amount of cash (other than restricted cash) held in a specific borrowing base qualified cash account and (b) $
100.0
 million  
 After g
iving effect to Amendment No. 2, unless a Covenant Relief Period (as defined below) had occurred and was continuing, t
he ABL Credit Agreement provided for a full cash dominion period (a) if an event of default was occurring or (b) beginning on the date on which Excess Availability (as defined below) was less than the greater of (i) 
12.5
% of the Line Cap (as defined below) and (ii) if the borrowing base then in effect was (A) less than $
200.0
 million, $
25.0
 million and (B) greater than or equal to $
200.0
 million, $
50.0
 million. Excess Availability was defined as (a) the lesser of (i) the total commitments of ABL Lenders and (ii) the borrowing base, minus (b) total outstanding revolving extensions of credit. Line Cap was defined as the lesser of the total commitments of ABL Lenders and the borrowing base. A Covenant Relief Period was a period during which no default had occurred and was continuing and (b) either of the following existed: (i) the aggregate revolving credit exposure of the ABL Lenders was not greater than $0 or (ii) each of (A) the amount of aggregate borrowings was not greater than $0; (B) the non-cash collateralized LC exposure (as defined under the ABL Credit Agreement) was not greater than $
15.0
 million, and (C) the borrowing base exceeded the sum of ABL Lenders’ letter of credit exposure.
Total liquidity under the ABL Facility was required to not be less than the greater of (i) 
20
% of the Line Cap and (ii) (A) if the borrowing base was less than $
200.0
 million, $
50.0
 million and (B) if the borrowing base was greater than or equal to $
200.0
 million, $
64.0
 million.  In addition, unless we were in a Covenant Relief Period, the Company could not permit Excess Availability to be less than the greater of (i) $
15.0
 million and (ii) 
10
% of the Line Cap.  
The ABL Credit Agreement set forth that (i) loans comprising each ABR Borrowing bore interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus an additional margin ranging from 
1.00
% to 
1.50
%, (ii) loans comprising each Canadian Prime Loan Borrowing bore interest at the Canadian Prime Rate plus an additional margin ranging from 
1.00
% to 
1.50
%, and (iii) the loans comprising each Term Benchmark Borrowing bore interest at the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate, the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate or Adjusted Term CORRA, as applicable, plus an additional margin ranging from 
2.00
% to 
2.50
%, in each instance subject to customary benchmark replacement provisions. Fluence Energy, LLC was required to pay to the ABL Lenders a commitment fee on the average daily unused portion of the commitments through maturity, which accrued at the rate of (a) until the last day of the first full calendar quarter following the closing of the ABL Facility, 
0.450
% per annum, and (b) thereafter, 
0.450
% per annum if average revolving loan utilization was less than or equal to 
50
% and 
0.375
% per annum if average revolving loan utilization was greater than 
50
%. The ABL Facility also provided for a letter of credit sublimit in the amount of $
200.0
 million, if certain conditions were met. Each letter of credit issuance was conditioned upon, among other conditions,
 the payment of certain customary issuance and administration fees, as well as payment of a fronting fee to each issuer thereof and payment of a letter of credit participation fee payable to the ABL Lenders. 
Capitalized terms used in this paragraph that are not otherwise defined are defined in the ABL Credit Agreement.

109
The ABL Credit Agreement contained customary covenants for this type of financing, including, but not limited to, covenants that restricted our ability to incur indebtedness; incur liens; sell, transfer, or dispose of property and assets; make investments or acquisitions; pay dividends, make distributions or other restricted payments; and engage in affiliate transactions. The ABL Credit Agreement limited our ability to make certain payments, including dividends and distributions on Fluence Energy, LLC’s equity, the Company’s equity and other restricted payments. Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries were limited in their ability to pay
 cash dividends to, lend to, or make other investments in Fluence Energy, Inc., subject to certain exceptions. If certain payment conditions under the ABL Credit Agreement were satisfied, then additional specified transactions could have been made by the Company. Such covenants were tested on a quarterly basis and upon the occurrence of other certain restricted payments, the incurrence of indebtedness, certain dispositions, and other specified transactions.
2024 Revolver 
On August 6, 2024 (the "Amendment Effective Date"), Fluence Energy, Inc. entered into Amendment Number Three ("Amendment No. 3") to that certain ABL Credit Agreement by and among Fluence Energy, LLC, as parent borrower, the Company, as parent, the other borrowers party thereto, the other guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto, and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent (as successor to Barclays Bank PLC) (such agreement, as so amended, the "2024 Credit Agreement") in order to (i) convert the existing ABL Facility to a senior secured cash flow revolving credit facility in an initial aggregate principal amount of up to $
500.0
 million (the "2024 Revolver"), (ii) replace Barclays as administrative agent under the 2024 Credit Agreement with Citibank, N.A., and (iii) make certain other modifications to the 2024 Credit Agreement as set forth therein. Capitalized terms used in this subsection that are not otherwise defined are defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement.
The 2024 Revolver is secured by (i) a first priority pledge of the Company's equity interests in Fluence Energy, LLC and Fluence Energy Global Production Operation, LLC, (ii) first priority security interests in substantially all tangible and intangible personal property of the Company, Fluence Energy, LLC, Fluence Energy Global Production Operation, LLC and certain of its foreign subsidiaries, in each case, subject to customary exceptions and limitations, and (iii) a pledge of the Company's equity interests in certain of its foreign subsidiaries and security interests in certain assets of such foreign subsidiaries.
The 2024 Credit Agreement sets forth that (i) loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus 
2.00
%, (ii) loans comprising each Term Benchmark Borrowing shall bear interest at the Term SOFR Rate or the Adjusted EURIBOR Rate, as applicable, plus 
3.00
%, and (iii) the loans comprising each RFR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Daily Simple RFR plus 
3.00
%, in each instance subject to customary benchmark replacement provisions including, but not limited to, alternative benchmark rates, customary spread adjustments with respect to borrowings in foreign currencies and benchmark replacement conforming changes. Fluence Energy, LLC is required to pay to the lenders a commitment fee on the average daily unused portion of the commitments through maturity, which shall accrue at the rate of 
0.50
% per annum. The 2024 Credit Agreement provides for a cash draw sublimit of $
150.0
 million as well as a letter of credit sublimit in the amount of $
500.0
 million if certain conditions are met. 
The 2024 Credit Agreement contains customary covenants for this type of financing, including, but not limited to, covenants that restrict our and certain of our subsidiary’s ability to: incur indebtedness; incur liens; sell, transfer, or dispose of property and assets; make investments or acquisitions; pay dividends, make distributions or other restricted payments; and engage in affiliate transactions. The 2024 Credit Agreement limits our ability to make certain payments, including dividends and distributions on Fluence Energy, LLC's equity, the Company's equity and other restricted payments. Under the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement, Fluence Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries are currently limited in their ability to pay cash dividends to, lend to, or make other investments in the Company, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, we are required to maintain (i) from the Amendment Effective Date through December 31, 2025, Total Liquidity of no less than $
150,000,000
, (ii) from January 1, 2026 and thereafter, Total Liquidity of no less than $
100,000,000
 or a Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the last day of any Measurement Period not to exceed 
3.50
:1.00, and (iii) certain other financial requirements at each Guarantor Coverage Test Date. S
uch covenants are tested on a quarterly basis and upon the occurrence of other certain restricted payments, the incurrence of indebtedness, certain dispositions, and other specified transactions. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all such covenants. 
The 2024 Credit Agreement contains customary events of default for this type of financing. If an event of default occurs with respect to a borrower, the lenders will be able to, among other things, terminate the commitments immediately, cash collateralize any outstanding letters of credit, declare any
 loans outstanding to be due and payable in whole or in part, and exercise other rights and remedies. The maturity date and the date of termination of lending commitments under the 2024 Credit Agreement both remain unchanged at November 22, 2027. 
As of September 30, 2024, there are 
no
 cash borrowings under the 2024 Revolver, and there are $
74.9
 million letters 
of credit outstanding under the 2024 Revolver, with remaining availability of $
425.1
 million, net of letters of credit issued.   
Borrowings Against Note Receivable - Pledged as Collateral
In December 2022, the Company transferred $
24.3
 million in customer receivables to Standard Chartered Bank (“SCB”) in the Philippines for proceeds of $
21.1
 million. The receivables all related to our largest customer in that country. The underlying receivables transferred were previously aggregated into a long term note, with interest, and a maturity date of September 30, 2024. In 
110
April 2023, the Company aggregated into an additional long term note and transferred an additional $
30.9
 million in receivables with the same customer to SCB for proceeds of $
27.0
 million, upon substantially similar terms as the December 2022 transfer and has a maturity date of December 27, 2024. These transactions are treated as secured borrowings as the Company did not transfer the entire note receivables due from the customer to SCB. The Company continues to receive quarterly interest income from the customer, while SCB is responsible for collecting payments on the principal balances which represent the initial receivable balances from the customer. The Company has no other continuing involvement or exposure related to the underlying receivables. On September 16, 2024, the $
24.3
 million of receivables were paid in full, resulting in release of the corresponding note and borrowing. As of September 30, 2024, the Company recorded net interest income of $
0.3
 million, which represents the net of $
4.4
 million in interest income and $
4.1
 million in interest expense recorded in “Interest income, net.” As of September 30, 2023, the Company recorded net interest income of $
1.0
 million, which represents the aggregate of $
3.4
 million in interest income and $
2.4
 million in interest expense.

In fiscal year 2024, the effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate of 21% primarily due to increases in profitability in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates higher than the U.S. and the U.S. taxation of the increased foreign earnings driven by the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income inclusion in the current year.

As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not have material undistributed foreign earnings. The Company has not recorded a deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings from its foreign subsidiaries, as such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.
Global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by controlled foreign corporations must be included currently in the gross income of the controlled foreign corporations’ U.S. parent. Under GAAP, the Company can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into measurement of deferred taxes. The Company has elected to record GILTI impacts as a current period expense.  
The foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 are approximately $
186.2
 million and $
263.1
 million, respectively. Approximately $
22.1
 million of the foreign net operating losses will expire between fiscal year 2025 and fiscal year 2034. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 are approximately $
135.8
 million ($

 million federal and $
84.7
 million state) and $
182.2
 million ($
107.1
 million federal and $

 million state), respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are attributable to Fluence Energy, Inc., a corporate entity which, upon IPO on November 1, 2021, became the holding company of Fluence Energy, LLC. The federal net operating losses have an unlimited carryforward period. Approximately $
73.5
 million of state net operating losses will expire between fiscal year 2032 and fiscal year 2044. 
As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company had recorded a valuation allowance of $
377.2
 million and $
371.7
 million, respectively.  In fiscal year 2023, the valuation allowances were recorded against deferred tax assets of the Company’s German, Australian, Philippines, Singapore, Netherlands, and United Kingdom subsidiaries, as well as Fluence Energy, Inc. As a holding company, Fluence Energy, Inc. recorded deferred tax assets primarily related to its investment in Fluence Energy, LLC.  In fiscal year 2024, the Company released valuation allowances that were recorded against deferred tax assets of the Company’s subsidiaries in Australia and the United Kingdom.  The Company determined that based on the weight of available evidence, including cumulative income, it is more likely-than-not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized.  For the remaining entities with previously recorded valuation allowances, including the Company’s German, Philippines, Netherlands, and Taiwan subsidiaries and Fluence Energy, Inc., the Company maintains that based on the weight of available evidence, including cumulative losses, it is more-likely-than-not that the net deferred tax assets will not be realized and recorded a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets.
112
The net increase in the valuation allowance of $
5.5
 million in fiscal year 2024 is due to a $
48.2
 million increase recorded through equity, a $
44.1
 million decrease in valuation allowance related to current year activity in jurisdictions with full valuation allowances of $
33.8
 million, as well as the release of valuation allowance in Australia and the United Kingdom subsidiaries of $
10.3
 million, and a $
1.5
 million increase related to currency translation adjustments. Further, a future reversal of $
2.6
 million of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024, would be accounted for as an increase in equity. For fiscal year 2023, the net increase in the valuation allowance was $
17.3
 million.
As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company has not recorded any unrecognized tax benefits. All tax jurisdictions remain subject to examination by foreign, federal, and state taxing authorities with the exception of Germany for the tax periods 2018 to 2020 for which the entity was issued a Cancellation Reservation of Review, which permanently closed these periods for audit. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.

Commitments and Contingencies 
Guarantees, Commitments, Letters of Credit, and Surety Bonds 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding bank guarantees, parent company guara
ntees, letters of credit, and surety bonds issued as performance security arrangements associated with a number of our customer projects. In addition, we have a limited number of parent company guarantees issued as payment security to certain vendors. 
These contractual commitments are all accounted for off-balance sheet. In the event that we fail to perform under a project backstopped by such credit support, the customer or vendor, respectively, may demand performance and/or payment, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of the project contract or vendor contract and applicable credit support instrument from the Company, surety, or bank, as the cas
e may be. Our relationship with our sureties is such that we will indemnify the sureties for any damages and expenses they incur in connection with any of the bonds they issue on our behalf and we may be required to post collateral to support the bonds. With respect to letters of credit, in the event of non-performance under a contract, direct obligations to repay the banks may arise. The Company expects that its performance and payment obligations secured by these bank guarantees, parent company guarantees, letters of credit, and surety bonds will generally be completed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms.
The following table summarizes contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024. Amounts presented in the following table represent the Company's current undiscounted exposure to guarantees, commitments, letters of credit, and surety bonds and the range of maximum undiscounted potential exposure. The maximum exposure is not reduced by the amounts, if any, that could be recovered under the recourse or collateralization provisions in the guarantees, commitments, letters of credit, and surety bonds.

Negotiations with our Largest Battery Module Vendor
In December 2021, the Company entered negotiations with our largest battery module vendor to amend the battery supply agreement. As part of the discussions, the vendor sought to renegotiate the price the Company would pay for battery modules purchased in calendar year 2022 as well as those expected to be purchased during the remainder of calendar year 2022 and calendar year 2023. As part of these negotiations, the Company also discussed settlement of contractual claims by Fluence to the vendor. These negotiations continued throughout calendar year 2022. On December 15, 2022, the Company finalized an agreement with the vendor, amending the supply agreement and resolving Fluence’s claims. The approximately $
19.5
 million settlement for our claims was recognized as a reduction of “Costs of goods and services” for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.
Product Performance Guarantees
Typical energy storage products and solutions contracts and long-term service agreements contain provisions for performance liquidated damages payments if the energy storage solution fails to meet the guaranteed performance thresholds at completion of the project or throughout the service agreement period.
Warranties
The Company is party to both assurance and service-type warranties for various lengths of time. The Company recognizes revenue for service-type warranties, which are referred to as extended warranties, using a straight-line approach over the service period. 
The Company provides a limited warranty related to the successful operation of battery-based energy storage solutions, apart from the service-type warranties described above and are normally provided for a limited period of time from 
one
 to 
five years
, after the commercial operation date or substantial completion depending on the contract terms. The warranties are considered assurance-type warranties which provide a guarantee of quality of the products. For assurance-type warranties, the Company records an estimate of future warranty cost over the period of construction, consistent with transfer of control and revenue recognition on the equipment or battery-based energy storage products. Furthermore, we accrue the estimated liability cost of specific reserves or recalls when they are probable and estimable if identified. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of “Costs of goods and services” in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
The Company’s assurance-type warranties are often backed by supplier covered warranties for major original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) such as batteries and inverters, which is included in our estimated warranty liability. The Company records a corresponding asset for a portion of the warranty cost to be covered by the supplier warranty due to the fact that the contracts are enforceable, the suppliers are financially viable, and we have a history of satisfying claims with our suppliers. The asset is recorded within “Other current assets” and “Other non-current assets” on the consolidated balance sheets. 
As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company accrued the below estimated warranty liabilities, the table reflects twelve months activity, respectively:

Effective March 31, 2023, the Company updated its estimation model for calculating the recurring warranty reserve rate, which is a key input into our estimated assurance-type warranty liability. We then subsequently updated the presentation effective September 30, 2023, to present the full warranty liability and record a corresponding asset for recoverable warranty costs from suppliers. 
114
The key inputs and assumptions used by us to estimate our warranty liability are: (1) the number of units expected to fail or be replaced over time (i.e., failure rate); and (2) the per unit cost of replacement, including shipping, labor costs, and costs for equipment necessary for repair or replacement that are expected to be incurred to replace or repair failed units over time (i.e., repair or replacement cost). The Company’s Safety and Quality department has primary responsibility to determine the estimated failure rates for each generation of product.
The assurance warranty liability and related warranty asset are reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. The Company may make additional adjustments to the estimated assurance warranty liability and related warranty asset based on our comparison of actual warranty results to expected results for significant differences or based on performance trends or other qualitative factors. If actual failure rates, or replacement costs differ from our estimates in future periods, changes to these estimates may be required, resulting in increases or decreases in our estimated assurance warranty liability and related warranty asset which may be material. As we are in an evolving market, there is a degree of estimation uncertainty regarding our estimated recurring warranty accrual rate. 
Legal Contingencies

From time to time, the Company may be involved in litigation, government investigations, and other regulatory or legal proceedings relating to claims that arise out of our operations and businesses and that cover a wide range of matters, including, but not limited to, intellectual property matters, commercial and contract disputes, insurance and property damage claims, labor and employment claims, torts and personal injury claims, product liability claims, environmental claims, and warranty claims. The Company accrues for litigation and claims when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. It is reasonably possible that some matters could have an unfavorable result to the Company and could require the Company to pay damages or make expenditures in amounts that could be material.
2021 Overheating Event at Customer Facility
On September 4, 2021, a 300 MW energy storage facility owned by one of our customers experienced an overheating event. Fluence served as the energy storage technology provider designed and installed portions of the facility, which was completed in fiscal year 2021. No injuries were reported from the incident. The facility was taken offline as teams from Fluence, our customer, and the battery designer/manufacturer investigated the incident. Our customer released initial findings in the second fiscal quarter of 2022 on what it contends is the root cause of the incident. At this time, Fluence cannot comment on or accept the customer’s stated findings. The customer’s stated findings, if ultimately confirmed and proven, could relate to certain scopes of work for which Fluence or its subcontractors could be responsible. The customer’s stated findings, however, could also relate to certain scopes of work for which other parties were responsible and/or relate to other causes, including the design and installation of portions of the facility over which Fluence did not have responsibility or control. The customer has alleged that Fluence is liable for the incident. Fluence has denied liability. No formal legal proceedings have been commenced, but it is reasonably possible that litigation may result from this matter if a resolution cannot be achieved. Any such dispute would also likely include claims by Fluence and counterclaims by the customer relating to disputed costs arising from the original design and construction of the facility. The customer announced in July of 2022 that a large portion of the facility was back online. We are currently not able to estimate the impact that this incident may have on our financial results. To date, we do not believe that this incident has impacted the market’s adoption of our products and solutions. 
2023 Project-Related Litigation
In October 2023, Fluence filed a complaint in the Superior Court of California, Contra Costa County, against Diablo Energy Storage, LLC, Empire Business Park, LLC, the Bank of New York Mellon and others, seeking approximately $
37.0
 million in damages arising from the supply and construction of an energy storage facility for the defendants, including for the defendants’ nonpayment of contractual amounts owed. On or about November 10, 2023, Defendant Diablo Energy Storage, LLC filed a cross-complaint against Fluence, seeking a minimum of $
25.0
 million of alleged damages and disgorgement of all compensation received by Fluence for the project, in the amount of approximately $
230.0
 million. The disgorgement claim was based upon an alleged deficiency in Fluence’s contractor license. Fluence denies the allegations in the cross-complaint and intends to vigorously defend them and to enforce our claims against the defendants. We are currently not able to estimate the impact, if any, that this litigation may have on our reputation or financial results, or on market adoption of our products.
SEC Investigation 
On February 22, 2024, as we previously disclosed, a short-seller report was published about the Company (the “Short Seller Report”). In response to the Short Seller Report, the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors completed an internal investigation, with the assistance of outside counsel and forensic accountants, into the allegations in the Short Seller Report. The Company has been informed that the SEC is conducting a formal investigation and asking for certain information regarding our financial reporting. The Company is fully cooperating with the SEC’s investigation. While we are unable to predict the likely outcome of this matter or the potential cost, exposure or duration of the process, based on the information we currently possess, we do not expect the total potential cost to be material to our financial condition.

Sales and Procurement Contracts with Related Parties 
The Company signs back-to-back battery-based energy storage product and related service contracts with AES, Siemens, their respective subsidiaries, other entities under common control, and other entities in which Siemens and AES have significant influence (collectively referred to as affiliates) in relation to execution of the affiliates’ contracts with external customers and also signs direct contracts with affiliates. The Company also signs consortium agreements to partner with affiliates to deliver battery-based energy storage products and related service contracts to external customers. When performing our obligations pursuant to such contracts, we may, from time to time, enter into related change orders or settlements with our related parties and their affiliates. 
The Company also provides consulting services to AES whereby Fluence will advise and in some cases provide support to AES on procurement, logistics, design, safety, and commissioning of certain of their projects. Revenue from consulting services is classified as “Revenue from sale of energy storage products and solutions” in the Company’s Disaggregation of revenue table in “Note 3 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers.”

Revenue from the consulting services is primarily recognized ratably over time based on a project specific period of performance in which we expect the performance obligation to be fulfilled. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we have recognized $
8.0
 million and $
12.3
 million, respectively, in revenue from consulting services with related parties. 
Revenue from contracts with affiliates is included in “Revenue from related parties” on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.
In addition, the Company purchases materials and supplies from its affiliates and records the costs in “Cost of goods and services” on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.
Administrative and Service Agreements
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company has received a limited scope of consulting services from Siemens Advanta, a subsidiary of Siemens AG, and limited treasury services related to executing trades for derivative contracts from AES.
In addition, a secondment arrangement with Siemens Industry is currently in place, pursuant to which Siemens Industry has seconded an employee to Fluence Energy, LLC through December 31, 2024. During the term of the secondment, Fluence Energy, LLC has the authority to supervise the employee in all respects and will reimburse Siemens Industry for the employee’s salary, employer required taxes, applicable bonuses, benefits, and services attendant to the employee’s relocation.
The costs of consulting services are recorded in “Costs of goods and services” or “General and administrative expenses” depending on the scope or nature of the underlying project. The other administrative service agreements are recorded in “General and administrative expenses” on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations.
116
Guarantees 
Fluence paid performance guarantee fees to its affiliates in exchange for guaranteeing Fluence’s performance obligations under certain contracts with Fluence’s customers, which are based on the affiliates’ weighted-average cost for bank guarantees and their per annum cost with a reasonable markup. These guarantees are provided pursuant to the Amended and Restated Credit Support and Reimbursement Agreement, dated June 9, 2021, with AES and Siemens Industry whereby they may, from time to time, agree to furnish credit support to us in the form of direct issuances of credit support to our lenders or other beneficiaries or through their lenders’ provision of letters of credit to backstop our own facilities or obligations. The guarantee fees are included in “Costs of goods and services” on Fluence’s consolidated statements of operations.

Stock-Based Compensation
The Option Plan
In 2020, Fluence Energy, LLC established the 2020 Unit Option Plan (the “Option Plan”) whereby employees, directors, and consultants, were originally granted non-qualified options to purchase Class A-1 units of Fluence Energy, LLC. As of September 30, 2021, the Company determined that achievement of the performance conditions related to awards granted under the Option Plan was not probable and therefore, 
no
 expense was recognized for the non-qualified options during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. The completion of the IPO on November 1, 2021 resulted in achievement of the performance condition for the majority of the underlying awards granted under the Option Plan. In connection with the IPO, the non-qualified options were converted into non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of Class A common stock of Fluence Energy, Inc. Non-qualified stock options under the Option Plan have a contractual term of 
ten years
 from the date of grant and an exercise price of $
2.45
. The Company estimated the fair value of the awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The outstanding unexercised options will continue to be governed by the terms of the existing Option Plan. The Option Plan is accounted for as an equity plan. The Company will not grant any further awards under the Option Plan. 
The following table summarizes the unit option activity under the Option Plan:

no
 unrecognized stock compensation expense.
The total intrinsic value of the stock options issued under the Option Plan that were exercised during the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, was $
40.0
 million, $
56.3
 million and $
13.0

Phantom Units
Employees, directors, and consultants were granted compensation under Fluence Energy, LLC’s Phantom Equity Incentive Plan (the “Phantom Incentive Plan”). As of September 30, 2021, the Company determined that achievement of the performance conditions related to awards granted under the Phantom Incentive Plan was not probable and therefore, 
no
 expense was recognized for the phantom units during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. The completion of the IPO on November 1, 2021 resulted in achievement of the performance condition for the majority of the underlying awards granted under the Phantom Incentive Plan. At the completion of the IPO, a portion of the awards to the Company’s officers were modified, extending out the vesting period. The Company will not make any further awards under the Phantom Incentive Plan.

2021 Stock-Based Compensation Plan
118
During fiscal year 2021, the Company established the 2021 Incentive Award Plan (the “2021 Incentive Plan”) which reserves 
9,500,000
 shares of Class A common stock of Fluence Energy, Inc. for issuance to management, other employees, consultants, and board members of the Company. The 2021 Incentive Plan governs both equity-based and cash-based awards, including incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, performance share units (“PSUs”), and restricted stock units (“RSUs”). Stock-based awards currently issued pursuant to the 2021 Incentive Plan that are expected to be settled by issuing shares of Class A common stock are recorded as equity awards. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
Restricted Stock Units
RSUs granted under the 2021 Incentive Plan vest ratably at one-third annually on the anniversary of the grant date over a 
three-year
 period. The Company generally expenses the grant date fair value of the awards on a straight-line basis over each of the 
three
 separately vesting tranches within a given grant. There is no contractual term on the RSUs granted under the 2021 Incentive Plan. The Company estimated the fair value of the awards using the market value of our Class A common stock. The market value of our Class A common stock is calculated using the closing price of our Class A common stock on the date of grant.

The granted RSUs generally vest in three equal annual installments. Total compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized as of September 30, 2024, was $
14.9
 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 
1.9
 years.  
Non-Qualified Stock Options
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted 
187,379
 non-qualified stock options to purchase Class A common stock under the 2021 Incentive Plan with a weighted average exercise price of $
21.70
. Non-qualified stock options under the 2021 Incentive Plan have a contractual term of 
ten years
 from the date of grant. The Company estimated the fair value of the awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The non-qualified stock options granted under the 2021 Incentive Plan vest ratably at one-third annually on the anniversary of the grant date over a 
three-year
 period pursuant to the terms of their applicable award agreements. The Company generally expenses the grant date fair value of the awards on a straight-line basis over each of the 
three
 separately vesting tranches within a given grant.

The total intrinsic value of the non-qualified stock options outstanding during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024 was $
0.2
 million. Total compensation cost related to non-vested awards not yet recognized as of September 30, 2024 totaled $
1.5
 million, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 
2.0
 years.
There were no non-qualified stock options issued under the 2021 Incentive Plan that are exercisable as of September 30, 2024. The number of options expected to vest is equal to the number of options granted, which reflects no expected forfeiture.
Performance Share Units
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted 
410,494
 PSUs redeemable for Class A common stock under the 2021 Incentive Plan. The PSUs are considered fully vested when both the performance and service based requirements are met in accordance with the vesting requirements and will be settled in shares no more than 60 days after September 30, 2026. The 
119
performance criteria for all current PSUs is based on target cumulative revenue and cumulative adjusted EBITDA for the two-fiscal year performance period of 2024 and 2025 set by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. The awards can be paid out in a range of 
50
% to 
200
%, with 
0
% paid out for below-threshold performance, based on the achievement of the performance criteria and upon continued service through the vesting period. The Company estimated the fair value of the awards using the market value of our Class A common stock. The market value is calculated using the closing price of our Class A common stock on the date of grant. The Company monitors the achievement of the performance criteria and expenses the grant date fair value of the awards probable to vest over the requisite service period. If there are changes to the amount of probable awards to vest based on achievement of performance criteria, the related stock-based compensation expense may be significantly increased or reduced in the period that our estimate changes.

Other
In connection with the acquisition of Nispera AG in 2022, Fluence issued 
531,202
 shares of restricted stock to Nispera’s management team. The estimated post combination expense to the Company as a result of the business combination was approximately $
6.9
 million which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining service period that was stipulated in each holder’s original restricted stock agreement.
In connection with the Phantom Unit Plan and grant of phantom units thereunder, the Company incurred $
3.0
 million in stock-based compensation expense which was settled in cash for the fiscal year end September 30, 2022. 
In relation to awards previously granted to the Company’s former CEO (Coughlin), who served as a director of the Company through the date of the IPO, in connection with separation, the Coughlin award modification 1) accelerated the vesting of phantom units to the IPO date that would have otherwise vested on the 
six-month
 anniversary of the consummation, and 2) accelerated the vesting of unit options to the IPO date that would have otherwise vested on April 2, 2022 assuming continued service. The resolution stipulates that the awards subject to accelerated vesting were to be settled fully in cash, using the IPO price to calculate the settlement value. All other equity awards granted to the individual were concurrently cancelled. Incremental stock-based compensation expense related to the modification was $
5.7
 million, which was recognized fully during the three months ended December 31, 2021.

Investment in Joint Venture
On August 5, 2022, Fluence Energy Singapore PTE. LTD., a subsidiary of Fluence Energy, LLC, and ReNew Power entered into an agreement to form a partnership in India for an initial investment of $
5.0
 million, plus a line of credit of $
15.0
 million each for a 
50
% interest in the partnership. We funded the investment and the joint venture commenced operations in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. The investment is recorded in “Other non-current assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. The investment is accounted for under the equity method with results being reported by Fluence one quarter in arrears. The joint venture is not considered a variable interest entity and we do not consolidate the joint venture as we do not hold a controlling financial interest. We recorded an insignificant equity method loss on the investment for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024.

Supply Chain Financing
The Company has provided certain of our suppliers with access to a supply chain financing program through a third-party financing institution (“SCF Bank”). This program allows the Company to seek extended payment terms up to 
120
 days with our suppliers and allows our suppliers to monetize their receivables prior to the payment due date, subject to a discount. The Company does not pledge any assets as collateral under the program. Once a supplier elects to participate in the program and reaches an agreement with SCF Bank, the supplier chooses which individual invoices to sell to the SCF Bank. The Company then pays SCF Bank on the invoice due date. The Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell an underlying receivable to SCF Bank. The agreements between our suppliers and SCF Bank are solely at their discretion and are negotiated directly between those 
two
 parties. Our suppliers’ ability to continue using such agreements is primarily dependent upon the strength of our financial condition and guarantees issued by AES and Siemens. As of September 30, 2024, AES and Siemens Corporation, a subsidiary of Siemens, issued guarantees of $
50
 million each, for a total of $
100
 million, to SCF Bank on our behalf.

Sale of Receivables under Master Receivables Purchase Agreement
On February 27, 2024, Fluence Energy, LLC entered into a Master Receivables Purchase Agreement (“MRPA”), by and among Fluence Energy, LLC and any other seller from time to time party thereto, as sellers and servicers, and Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank ("CACIB"), as purchaser. 
Pursuant to the MRPA, Fluence Energy, LLC may sell certain receivables (the “Purchased Receivables”) to CACIB from time to time, and CACIB may agree to purchase the Purchased Receivables in each case, on an uncommitted basis. The MRPA provides that the outstanding amount of all purchased receivables under the MRPA will not exceed $
75.0
 million, with sublimits for each account debtor and for certain kinds of receivables. The MRPA may be terminated by either party at any time by 
30
 days’ prior written notice. Fluence Energy, LLC has granted CACIB a security interest in the purchased receivables, and proceeds thereof, as more fully described in the MRPA, in order to perfect CACIB’s ownership interest in the purchased receivables and secure the payment and performance of all obligations of Fluence Energy, LLC to CACIB under the MRPA. The MRPA contains other customary representations and warranties and covenants.
When receivables are sold under the MRPA, they are sold without recourse, and our continuing involvement is limited to their servicing, for which the Company receives a fee commensurate with the service provided and therefore no servicing asset or liability related to these receivables was recognized for any period presented. The fair value of the sold receivables approximated their book value due to their short-term nature.
For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, we sold receivables to CACIB under the MRPA for net proceeds of $
71.5
 million. At the date of the true sale, the receivables were de-recognized in their entirety from the consolidated balance sheets. We charged a fee to our customer, primarily for providing extended payment terms, in relation to the sale of receivables. We recorded factoring income of $
2.1
 million and related factoring discount of $
2.1
 million during the period. The factoring income is recorded in “Other (income) expense, net” and the factoring discount is recorded in “Sales and marketing expense” on the consolidated statements of operations.
 Proceeds from the sold receivables are reflected in operating cash flows on the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Derivatives and Hedging
Certain of the Company’s foreign operations expose the Company to fluctuations of foreign exchange rates. These fluctuations may impact the value of the Company’s cash receipts and payments in terms of the functional currency of the transacting party. The Company’s primary exposure results from the foreign currency impact of intercompany sales of inventory to regional entities by the Company’s centralized procurement entity. These intercompany sales are denominated in the functional currency of the regional entities, primarily the Euro, the British Pound and the Australian dollar, while the functional currency of the centralized procurement entity is the U.S. dollar. This introduces foreign exchange risk on the revenues recorded for such intercompany sales. The Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These contracts are entered into with large, reputable financial institutions that are monitored for counterparty credit risks.
For the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gains or losses on the effective portion of such hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings within revenue in the consolidated statements of operations (i.e., when control of the inventory is passed to third-party customers and revenue is recognized). The change in fair value of the components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, including changes in the spot-forward differential and counterparty non-performance risk, will also be recognized within revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company currently also has foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated as hedges and the changes in fair value of such derivatives are recognized in current period earnings. As of September 30, 2024, the impact on our consolidated financial statements was not significant.

FLUENCE ENERGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(PARENT COMPANY ONLY)
(U.S. Dollars in Thousands)

1.
Organization and Operations
Fluence Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Parent Company”), was formed on June 21, 2021. We conduct our business operations through Fluence Energy, LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Upon the completion of our initial public offering (the “IPO”) on November 1, 2021, Fluence Energy, Inc. became a holding company whose sole material assets are the limited liability interests (“LLC Interests”) in Fluence Energy, LLC. All of our business is conducted through Fluence Energy, LLC, together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Fluence Energy, LLC is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and, as a result, its members, including Fluence Energy, Inc. will pay income taxes with respect to their allocable shares of its net taxable income. 
 Our fiscal year begins on October 1 and ends on September 30. References to “fiscal year 2022,” “fiscal year 2023”, and “fiscal year 2024” refer to the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively.
On November 1, 2021, the Parent Company completed an IPO and a series of organization transactions (collectively with the IPO, the “Transactions”), in which the Company issued and sold 
35,650,000
 shares of its Class A common stock, par value $
0.00001
 per share (the “Class A common stock”), at the public offering price of $
28.00
 per share, which includes the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 
4,650,000
 shares of the Class A common stock. The net proceeds to the Company from the IPO we
re $
948.0
 million
, after deducting underwriting discounts. Other offering expenses incurred related to the IPO were paid for by Fluence Energy, LLC. 
2.     Basis of Presentation

These condensed parent company financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Fluence Energy, Inc. and the accompanying notes thereto, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024. For purposes of these condensed financial statements, the Parent Company's interest in Fluence Energy, LLC is recorded based upon its proportionate share of Fluence Energy, LLC’s net assets (similar to presenting them on the equity method).
Certain intercompany balances presented in these condensed Parent Company financial statements are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. $
2.8
 million and $
1.5
 million of payables were eliminated in consolidation as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
3.   Commitments and Contingencies 

On October 27, 2021, the Parent Company entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement (the “Tax Receivable Agreement”) with Fluence Energy, LLC, Siemens Industry, Inc. (“Siemens Industry”) and AES Grid Stability, LLC (“AES Grid Stability” and together with Siemens Industry, the “Founders”) which obligates the Parent Company to make payments to the Founders of 
85
% of the amount of certain tax benefits that Fluence Energy, Inc. actually realizes, or in some circumstances is deemed to realize, arising from the basis adjustments and certain other tax benefits arising from payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Increases in tax basis and tax basis adjustments generated over time may increase (for tax purposes) the depreciation and amortization deductions available to Fluence Energy, Inc. and, therefore, may reduce the amount of U.S. federal, state, and local tax that Fluence Energy, Inc. would otherwise be required to pay in the future, although the Internal Revenue Service may challenge all or part of the validity of that tax basis, and a court could sustain such a challenge.
The amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement are contingent upon (i) sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the tax benefits; (ii) Fluence Energy, LLC is able to fully depreciate or amortize its assets; and (iii) no material changes in applicable tax law. The payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not conditioned upon continued ownership of Fluence Energy, LLC by the Founders. As of September 30, 2024, we estimate $
1.5
 million of payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to be realized. The payment will be finalized upon the filing of the Fluence Energy, Inc. U.S. income tax return during the year ending September 30, 2025. With the exception of the $

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the objective that information in our reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified and pursuant to the requirements of the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, and as a result of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below, management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024  our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 based on the framework set forth in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. 
Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 as a result of the existence of the material weakness discussed below. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
127
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data herein. 
Material Weaknesses and Remediation Measures
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is 
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
We determined that a material weakness in internal control over revenue recognition exists. The Company did not consistently apply controls in its revenue recognition process related to the evaluation of contract terms for purposes of determining their impact on when costs are included in the measure of progress. 
We have enhanced controls over the evaluation of contract terms and placed them into operation; we believe our efforts to consistently apply our revenue recognition controls over a sustained period of time will enable us to successfully remediate our material weakness in fiscal year 2025 however, we cannot provide assurance as to when our further remediation measures will be complete. We will consider the material weakness remediated after the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Other than the changes to our internal control over financial reporting described in “Material Weaknesses and Remediation Measures” above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
