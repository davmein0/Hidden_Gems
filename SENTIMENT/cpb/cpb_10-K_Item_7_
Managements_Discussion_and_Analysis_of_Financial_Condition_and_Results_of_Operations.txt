Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
OVERVIEW 
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," as well as the information contained in "Risk Factors."
Unless otherwise stated, the terms "we," "us," "our" and the "company" refer to The Campbell's Company and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Executive Summary
We are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded food and beverage products. We operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories.
In 2025, we continued to advance our key strategic initiatives in a dynamic operating environment marked by shifting global trade policies, increased regulatory activity, consumer behavior shifts, commodity cost fluctuations and other global macroeconomic challenges. During 2025, we experienced elevated cost inflation and other supply chain costs, which were mostly offset by improvements in our supply chain productivity and benefits from our cost savings initiatives. In 2026, we expect more significant cost pressures primarily driven by tariff impacts. We plan to reduce some of these costs and impacts over time through cost savings initiatives, inventory management practices, supplier collaboration, alternative sourcing opportunities, continued supply chain productivity initiatives, surgical pricing actions where necessary and other mitigation efforts. We will continue to evaluate the dynamic macroeconomic environment to take action to mitigate the impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Strategy
Our strategy is built around four pillars that position us to achieve Top-Tier Performance for our shareholders, as further discussed below.
•
Top Team
: We plan to deliver for our people by continuing to cultivate a highly engaged culture to attract, grow and retain top talent. This includes investing in leadership and development programs and elevating commercial capabilities that will help us grow. We are driving organizational engagement, belonging and effectiveness through our

Employee Value Proposition, 
Make history with Campbell’s
, and modernizing our facilities. We have completed the consolidation of our Snacks offices into Camden, New Jersey. Our single headquarters has helped to foster closer collaboration and enhance decision-making, thereby improving our ability to execute on our business strategy. 
•
Best Portfolio
: We believe in delivering for our consumers through consumer-focused marketing efforts and increased leadership brand support. We have created a Growth Office to support our two divisions and to expand our consumer-led innovations. We believe that we are well-positioned as a transformative category leader with an advantaged portfolio of brands across our Meals & Beverages and Snacks segments. We will support our Best Portfolio priority and accelerate our profitable growth model by growing market share and driving integrated business planning programming throughout the company. 
•
Winning Execution
: We will focus on delivering for our customers by advancing strategic retailer relationships and continuing to optimize our manufacturing and distribution network, with a focus on digitization, logistics and distribution expertise. In September 2024, we announced plans to implement new cost savings initiatives with targeted annual savings of approximately $250 million by the end of 2028. On September 3, 2025, we increased the estimate of annual ongoing savings, once all phases are implemented, to approximately $375 million by the end of 2028. See "Restructuring Charges, Cost Savings Initiatives and Other Optimization Initiatives" for additional information on these initiatives.
•
Lasting Impact
: Finally, we plan to continue to deliver for our communities with continued progress on our sustainability and community goals and strengthening our connection to the communities in which we operate.
Business Trends
Our industry continues to navigate a dynamic operating and regulatory environment driven by commodity cost volatility, supply chain pressures, tariffs and shifting global trade policies and other economic uncertainties, as well as evolving consumer purchasing and spending patterns.
Our strategy is designed, in part, to capture growing consumer preferences for value and convenience. We expect consumers to continue to seek at-home cooking solutions and stretchable meals. We also believe that consumers are making more intentional decisions in snacking, in terms of health and wellness and seeking indulgences.
Retailers continue to use their buying power and negotiating strength to seek increased promotional programs funded by their suppliers and more favorable terms, including supplier-funded customized products. Any consolidations among retailers would continue to create large and sophisticated customers that may further this trend. Retailers also continue to grow and promote private label brands that compete with branded products, especially on price.
Tariffs on certain ingredients, inputs and imports from many countries, including Canada, Mexico, members of the European Union and the United Kingdom have resulted in increased costs, including on ingredients, packaging, such as tinplate steel used to make cans and other materials used to produce and distribute our products and on finished products that we import. We are continuing to monitor the rapidly evolving tariff and global trade policies and are working with our suppliers to mitigate potential impacts on our business. The extent and duration of the tariffs and the resulting impact on general economic conditions and on our business are uncertain and depend on various factors, such as recent legal challenges to the U.S.'s imposition of tariffs, negotiations between the U.S. and affected countries, the responses of other countries or regions, relief that may be granted, availability and cost of alternative sources of supply and demand for our products in affected markets.
In addition, in light of recent actions by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and states, we anticipate continued legislative and regulatory developments with respect to food ingredients, labeling and packaging at the state and federal levels, along with related changes in consumer expectations and behavior. In April 2025, the FDA called on industry to phase out all “petroleum-based synthetic dyes” from the nation’s food supply, and in May 2025, the MAHA Commission published an assessment report discussing factors contributing to chronic childhood disease including diet, environmental exposure, lack of physical activity and healthcare. The MAHA Commission transmitted its strategy report, setting forth certain recommendations for addressing chronic childhood disease, to the President in August 2025 and publicly released it in September 2025. While the effects of all of these proposals remain uncertain at this time, we are continuing to monitor changes to laws and regulations that affect the food industry and evaluate their impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In 2026, we expect significant cost pressures primarily driven by tariff impacts that could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We will continue to evaluate the dynamic macroeconomic environment to take action to mitigate such impacts.

On March 12, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Sovos Brands, Inc. (Sovos Brands) for total purchase consideration of $2.899 billion. For additional information on the Sovos Brands acquisition, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. All references to the acquisition below refer to the Sovos Brands acquisition.
On May 30, 2023, we completed the sale of our Emerald nuts business. On August 26, 2024, we completed the sale of our Pop Secret popcorn business.

Summary of Results 
This Summary of Results provides significant highlights from the discussion and analysis that follows. 
There were 53 weeks in 2025 and 52 weeks in 2024 and 2023.
•
Net sales increased 6% in 2025 to $10.253 billion primarily due to an 8-point benefit from the acquisition of Sovos Brands and a 2-point benefit from the 53
rd
 week, partially offset by the impact of divestitures, unfavorable volume/mix and lower net price realization.
•
Gross profit, as a percent of sales, decreased to 30.4% in 2025 from 30.8% a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs and unfavorable net price realization, partially offset by the benefits from supply chain productivity improvements.
•
Earnings per share were $2.01 in 2025, compared to $1.89 a year ago. The current year included expenses of $.97 per share and the prior year included expenses of $1.19 per share from items impacting comparability as discussed below.

In 2025, Meals & Beverages sales increased 15% primarily due to a 15-point benefit from the acquisition of Sovos Brands. Excluding the benefit from the Sovos Brands acquisition, the benefit of the additional week and the impact from the divestiture of the noosa yoghurt business, sales were comparable primarily due to gains in foodservice, Canada and 
Rao's
 pasta sauces, partially offset by declines in U.S. soup and 
SpaghettiOs
. Favorable volume/mix was offset by unfavorable net price realization. Including a 1-point benefit from the additional week, sales of U.S. soup were comparable with prior year as increases in broth and condensed soups were offset by decreases in ready-to-serve soups. 
In 2024, Meals & Beverages sales increased 7% reflecting a 9-point benefit from the acquisition of Sovos Brands. Sales were impacted by unfavorable volume/mix with neutral net price realization. Excluding the benefit from the acquisition, sales decreased primarily due to declines in U.S. retail products, including beverages and U.S. soup, partially offset by gains in foodservice and Canada. Sales of U.S. soup decreased 2% primarily due to decreases in ready-to-serve soups and condensed soups, partially offset by an increase in broth. 
In 2025, Snacks sales decreased 4%. Excluding the impact from the divestiture of the Pop Secret popcorn business and the benefit of the additional week, sales decreased due to declines in third-party partner brands and contract manufacturing, 
Goldfish
 crackers, 
Snyder's of Hanover
 pretzels, 
Lance
 sandwich crackers, fresh bakery and Pepperidge Farm cookies. Sales were impacted by volume/mix declines with neutral net price realization.
In 2024, Snacks sales decreased 2%. Excluding the impact from the divestiture of the Emerald nuts business, sales decreased as declines in third-party partner brands and contract manufacturing, fresh bakery and 
Pop Secret
 popcorn were partially offset by increases in 
Goldfish
 crackers, 
Lance
 sandwich crackers and 
Cape Cod
 potato chips. Volume/mix declines were partially offset by favorable net price realization. 
Gross Profit
Gross profit, defined as Net sales less Cost of products sold, increased by $148 million in 2025 from 2024 and increased by $54 million in 2024 from 2023. As a percent of sales, gross profit was 30.4% in 2025, 30.8% in 2024 and 31.2% in 2023. 
The 40 basis-point decreases in gross profit margin in 2025 and 2024, were due to the following factors:

2025 includes a positive margin impact of 20 basis points from lapping the 20 basis-point negative margin impact in 2024 from a Sovos Brands acquisition date fair value adjustment for inventory. 
Marketing and Selling Expenses
Marketing and selling expenses as a percent of sales were 9.0% in 2025, 8.6% in 2024 and 8.7% in 2023. Marketing and selling expenses increased 11% in 2025 from 2024. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the acquisition (approximately 7 points); higher advertising and consumer promotion expense (approximately 2 points) and higher costs related to cost savings and optimization initiatives (approximately 2 points). The increase in advertising and consumer promotion expense was driven by Meals & Beverages and Snacks.
25 
Marketing and selling expenses increased 3% in 2024 from 2023. The increase was primarily due to the impact of the acquisition (approximately 4 points); higher selling expenses (approximately 1 point) and higher other marketing expenses (approximately 1 point), partially offset by lower advertising and consumer promotion expense (approximately 3 points), primarily in Meals & Beverages. 
Administrative Expenses
Administrative expenses as a percent of sales were 6.6% in 2025, 7.6% in 2024 and 7.0% in 2023. Administrative expenses decreased 9% in 2025 from 2024. The decrease was primarily due to increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 8 points); costs associated with the acquisition in the prior year (approximately 6 points); lower incentive compensation (approximately 2 points); lower costs related to cost savings initiatives (approximately 2 points); and lower benefit-related costs (approximately 1 point), partially offset by higher general administrative costs and inflation (approximately 7 points) and the impact of the acquisition (approximately 3 points).
Administrative expenses increased 13% in 2024 from 2023. The increase was primarily due to costs associated with the acquisition (approximately 7 points); higher costs related to cost savings initiatives (approximately 5 points); higher general administrative costs and inflation (approximately 3 points); the impact of the acquisition (approximately 2 points) and higher benefit-related costs (approximately 2 points), partially offset by increased benefits from cost savings initiatives (approximately 5 points) and lower incentive compensation (approximately 2 points).

The increase was primarily due to the benefit of the acquisition of Sovos Brands and the benefit of the additional week, partially offset by lower gross profit. Gross profit margin decreased due to higher cost inflation and other supply chain costs, unfavorable net price realization and the dilutive impact of the acquisition, partially offset by supply chain productivity improvements, benefits from cost savings initiatives and favorable volume/mix.
Operating earnings from Meals & Beverages increased 9% in 2024 versus 2023. The increase was primarily due to the benefit of the acquisition of Sovos Brands and lower marketing and selling expenses, partially offset by lower gross profit.

Interest Expense
Interest expense was $345 million in 2025, $249 million in 2024 and $188 million in 2023. The increases in 2025 and 2024 were primarily due to higher levels of debt to fund the acquisition in 2024 and higher average interest rates on the debt portfolio each year.
Taxes on Earnings
The effective tax rate was 24.4% in 2025, 25.1% in 2024 and 23.9% in 2023.
The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2025 from 2024 was primarily due to 
nondeductible costs associated with the acquisition of Sovos Brands in the prior year, excess tax benefits associated with the vesting of stock-based compensation awards in the current year and state tax law changes, partially offset by $15 million of tax expense related to the sale of the noosa yoghurt business.
The increase in the effective rate in 2024 from 2023 was primarily due to 
nondeductible costs associated with the acquisition.
Restructuring Charges, Cost Savings Initiatives and Other Optimization Initiatives
Multi-year Cost Savings Initiatives and Snyder's-Lance, Inc. (Snyder's-Lance) Cost Transformation Program and Integration
Continuing Operations
Beginning in 2015, we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure. 
Over the years, we expanded these initiatives by continuing to optimize our supply chain and manufacturing networks, as well as our information technology infrastructure.
On March 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. Prior to the acquisition, Snyder's-Lance launched a cost transformation program following a comprehensive review of its operations with the goal of significantly improving its financial performance. We continued to implement this program and identified opportunities for additional cost synergies as we integrated Snyder's-Lance.
In 2022, we expanded these initiatives as we continued to pursue cost savings by further optimizing our supply chain and manufacturing network and through effective cost management. In the second quarter of 2023, we announced plans to consolidate our Snacks offices in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Norwalk, Connecticut, into our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey.

As of July 28, 2024, we substantially completed the multi-year cost savings initiatives and Snyder's-Lance cost transformation program and integration, and we generated total pre-tax savings of approximately $950 million. Certain phases that had not been fully implemented were incorporated into the 2025 cost savings initiatives described below. 
Sovos Brands Integration Initiatives
On March 12, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Sovos Brands. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We identified opportunities for cost synergies as we integrate Sovos Brands.
In 2024, we recorded Restructuring charges of $21 million for severance pay and benefits related to initiatives to achieve the synergies and generated pre-tax savings of $10 million. The charges incurred in 2024 were associated with the Meals & Beverages segment. 
In 2025, the initiatives to achieve synergies were incorporated into the cost savings initiatives described below.
2025 Cost Savings Initiatives
On September 10, 2024, we announced plans to implement cost savings initiatives beginning in 2025, including initiatives to further optimize our supply chain and manufacturing network, optimization of our information technology infrastructure and targeted cost management. We also identified additional opportunities for cost synergies as we integrate Sovos Brands. As mentioned above, we substantially completed our previous multi-year cost savings initiatives and Snyder's-Lance cost transformation program and integration. Certain initiatives from that program have been incorporated into our 2025 cost savings initiatives. Cost estimates for the 2025 initiatives, as well as timing for certain activities, are continuing to be developed.

The total estimated pre-tax costs for actions that have been identified to date are approximately $
215
 million, and we expect to incur substantially all of the costs through 2028. These estimates will be updated as the detailed plans are developed.
We expect the costs for the actions that have been identified to date to consist of the following: approximately $
30
 million in severance pay and benefits; approximately $
55
 million in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation; and approximately $
130
 million in implementation costs and other related costs. We expect these pre-tax costs to be associated with our segments as follows: Meals & Beverages - approximately 
71
%; Snacks - approximately 
11
% and Corporate - approximately 
18
%.
Of the aggregate $
215
 million of pre-tax costs identified to date, we expect approximately $
155
 million will be cash expenditures. In addition, we expect to invest approximately $
205
 million in capital expenditures, of which we invested $
147
 million as of August 3, 2025. The capital expenditures primarily relate to optimization of production within our manufacturing network, optimization of information technology infrastructure and applications and implementation of our existing SAP enterprise-resource planning system for Sovos Brands.
On September 10, 2024 we announced that we expect these initiatives, once all phases are implemented, to generate annual ongoing savings of approximately $250 million by the end of 2028. On September 3, 2025, we increased the estimate of annual ongoing savings, once all phases are implemented, to approximately $375 million by the end of 2028. As of August 3, 2025, we have generated total program-to-date pre-tax savings of $145 million.

Other Optimization Initiatives
In the second quarter of 2024, we began implementation of an initiative to improve the effectiveness of our Snacks direct-store-delivery route-to-market network. Pursuant to this initiative we will purchase certain Pepperidge Farm and Snyder's-Lance routes where there are opportunities to unlock greater scale in select markets, combine them and sell the combined routes to independent contractor distributors. We expect to execute this program in a staggered rollout and to incur expenses of up to approximately $
115
 million through 2029. In 2025, we incurred $
20
 million in Marketing and selling expenses and $
1
 million in Administrative expenses related to this initiative. In 2024, we incurred $
5
 million in Marketing and selling expenses related to this initiative. As of August 3, 2025, we have incurred $
25
 million in Marketing and selling expenses and $
1
 million in Administrative expenses related to this initiative.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term borrowings; short-term borrowings, which may include commercial paper; credit facilities; and cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements.
Operating Activities
We generated cash flows from operations of $1.131 billion in 2025, compared to $1.185 billion in 2024. The decline in 2025 was primarily due to changes in working capital.
We generated cash flows from operations of $1.185 billion in 2024, compared to $1.143 billion in 2023. The increase in 2024 was primarily due to changes in working capital. 
We had negative working capital of $674 million as of August 3, 2025, and $1.386 billion as of July 28, 2024. Current assets were less than current liabilities, which included debt maturing in one year, due to a focus on lowering core working capital requirements. Total debt maturing within one year was $762 million as of August 3, 2025, and $1.423 billion as of July 28, 2024. We have $400 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes maturing in March 2026 that we expect to repay and/or refinance using available resources, which may include cash on hand, accessing the capital markets, commercial paper and/or revolving credit facility.
As part of our focus to lower core working capital requirements, we have worked with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, including the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with our suppliers, which we deem to be commercially reasonable, generally range from 0 to 120 days. We also maintain agreements with third-party administrators that allow participating suppliers to track payment obligations from us, and, at the sole discretion of the supplier, sell those payment obligations to participating financial institutions. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled 
30 
payment terms, are not impacted. Supplier participation in these agreements is voluntary. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter into these agreements and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions. We have not pledged assets as security or provided any guarantees in connection with these arrangements. The payment of these obligations is included in cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Amounts outstanding under these programs, which are included in Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $240 million at August 3, 2025, and $243 million at July 28, 2024.
Investing Activities
Capital expenditures were $426 million in 2025, $517 million in 2024 and $370 million in 2023. Capital expenditures are expected to total approximately $420 million in 2026. Capital expenditures in 2025 included network optimization for our Meals & Beverages business, chip and cracker capacity expansion for our Snacks business and enhancements to our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. Capital expenditures in 2024 included chip and cracker capacity expansion for our Snacks business, upgrades of assets across both segments of the business, enhancements to our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey and network optimization for our Meals & Beverages business. Capital expenditures in 2023 included chip and cracker capacity expansion for our Snacks business and a new manufacturing line for our Meals & Beverages business.
In Snacks, we have a direct-store-delivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors. From time to time, we purchase and sell routes, including certain routes under our optimization initiatives. The purchase and sale proceeds of the routes are reflected in investing activities. 
On March 12, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Sovos Brands. Cash consideration was $2.857 billion. The acquisition was funded through the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement of $2 billion and cash on hand.
On February 24, 2025, we sold the noosa yoghurt business for $188 million, subject to certain customary purchase price adjustments. On August 26, 2024, we sold our Pop Secret popcorn business for $70 million. On May 30, 2023, we completed the sale of our Emerald nuts business for $41 million.
Financing Activities
Dividend payments were $459 million in 2025, $445 million in 2024 and $447 million in 2023. Annual dividends declared were $1.54 per share in 2025, and $1.48 per share in 2024 and 2023. The 2025 fourth quarter dividend was $.39 per share. The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board and depends on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors that our Board deems relevant to its analysis and decision making.
In September 2021, the Board approved a strategic share repurchase program of up to $500 million (September 2021 program). The September 2021 program has no expiration date, but it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the September 2021 program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. In September 2024, the Board authorized a new anti-dilutive share repurchase program of up to $250 million (September 2024 program) to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under our stock compensation programs. The September 2024 program has no expiration date, but it may be discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the September 2024 program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. The September 2024 program replaced an anti-dilutive share repurchase program of up to $250 million that was approved by the Board in June 2021 and has been terminated. In 2025, we repurchased 1.303 million shares at a cost of $62 million pursuant to our anti-dilutive share repurchase program. In 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 1.56 million shares at a cost of $67 million and 2.698 million shares at a cost of $142 million, respectively. As of August 3, 2025, approximately $198 million remained available under the September 2024 program and approximately $301 million remained under the September 2021 program. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Market for Registrant's Capital Stock, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" for additional information.
On November 15, 2022, we entered into a delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement) totaling up to $500 million scheduled to mature on November 15, 2025. Loans under the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement bear interest at the rates specified in the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other conditions. The 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense (as each is defined in the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement) of not less than 3.25:1.00, and events of default for credit facilities of this type. We borrowed $500 million under the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement on March 13, 2023, and used the proceeds and cash on hand to repay the 3.65% $566 million Notes that matured on March 15, 2023. On April 5, 2024, we repaid $100 million of the $500 million outstanding under the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement. The remaining $400 million was repaid in October 2024 and November 2024 as described below.
31 
On October 10, 2023, we entered into the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement totaling up to $2 billion scheduled to mature on October 8, 2024. Loans under the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement bear interest at the rates specified in the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other conditions. The 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense (as each is defined in the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement) of not less than 3.25:1.00, and events of default for credit facilities of this type. The proceeds of the loans under the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement could only be used in connection with the acquisition of Sovos Brands and the payment of fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. On March 12, 2024, we borrowed $2 billion under the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement and used the proceeds in order to fund the acquisition of Sovos Brands, along with the fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith.
In August 2023, we filed a registration statement with the SEC that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. Under the registration statement we may issue debt securities from time to time, depending on market conditions.
On March 19, 2024, pursuant to the registration statement, we issued senior unsecured notes of $2.5 billion, consisting of:
•
$400 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.30% per annum, due March 20, 2026, with interest payable semi-annually on each of March 20 and September 20 commencing September 20, 2024;
•
$500 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.20% per annum, due March 19, 2027, with interest payable semi-annually on each of March 19 and September 19 commencing September 19, 2024;
•
$600 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.20% per annum, due March 21, 2029, with interest payable semi-annually on each of March 21 and September 21 commencing September 21, 2024; and 
•
$1 billion aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.40% per annum, due March 21, 2034, with interest payable semi-annually on each of March 21 and September 21 commencing September 21, 2024.
The notes contain customary covenants and events of default. If a change of control triggering event occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the purchase date. 
We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay the 
$2 billion of outstanding
 borrowings under the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement used to fund the Sovos Brands acquisition, including fees and expenses in connection therewith, and the remainder of the net proceeds to repay commercial paper.
On October 2, 2024, pursuant to the registration statement, we completed the issuance of senior unsecured notes of $1.15 billion, consisting of:
•    $800 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 4.75% per annum, due March 23, 2035, with interest payable semi-annually on each of March 23 and September 23 commencing March 23, 2025; and
•    $350 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 5.25% per annum, due October 13, 2054, with interest payable semi-annually on each of April 13 and October 13 commencing April 13, 2025.
The notes contain customary covenants and events of default. If a change of control triggering event occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the purchase date. In October 2024, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes to repay $200 million of the $400 million outstanding under the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement due November 15, 2025 and a portion of our outstanding commercial paper. In November 2024, we repaid the remaining $200 million outstanding under the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement. In March 2025, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes along with cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper to repay a $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes that matured in March 2025.
On April 16, 2024, we terminated our existing revolving credit facility dated September 27, 2021 (as amended on April 4, 2023). On April 16, 2024, we entered into a Five-Year Credit Agreement for an unsecured, senior revolving credit facility (the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) in an aggregate principal amount equal to $1.85 billion with a maturity date of April 16, 2029, or such later date as extended pursuant to the terms set forth in the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. On August 5, 2025, we entered into an Extension Agreement to extend the maturity date of the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement by one year from April 16, 2029 to April 16, 2030. The 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement remained unused at August 3, 2025, except for $1 million of standby letters of credit that we issued under it. We may increase the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement commitments up to an additional $500 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Loans under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will bear interest at the rates specified in the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other conditions. The 2024 
32 
Revolving Credit Facility Agreement facility contains customary covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of not less than 3.25:1.00 and customary events of default for credit facilities of this type. The facility supports our commercial paper program and other general corporate purposes. We expect to continue to access the commercial paper markets, bank credit lines and utilize cash flows from operations to support our short-term liquidity requirements.
As of August 3, 2025, we had $762 million of short-term borrowings due within one year, of which $332 million was comprised of commercial paper borrowings. As of August 3, 2025, we issued $27 million of standby letters of credit.
We are in compliance with the covenants contained in our credit facilities and debt securities.
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS
Contractual Obligations
We have short- and long-term material cash requirements related to our contractual obligations that arise in the normal course of business. In addition to principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt obligations, our contractual obligations primarily consist of purchase commitments, lease payments and pension and postretirement benefits.
See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our principal payments for short-term borrowings and long-term debt obligations as of August 3, 2025. Interest payments primarily for short-term borrowings and long-term debt as of August 3, 2025 are approximately as follows: $304 million in 2026; $529 million in 2027 through 2028; $388 million in 2029 through 2030; and $1.846 billion from 2031 through maturity. Interest payments are based on principal amounts and coupons or contractual rates at fiscal year end.
Purchase commitments represent purchase orders and long-term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of ingredients, supplies, machinery, equipment, contract manufacturing and services. As of August 3, 2025, purchase commitments totaled approximately $1.966 billion. Approximately $1.403 billion of these purchase commitments will be settled in the ordinary course of business in the next 12 months and the balance of $563 million from 2027 through 2031.
See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our lease obligations as of August 3, 2025.
As of August 3, 2025, we have a pension liability of $98 million and a postretirement benefit obligation of $127 million. As of August 3, 2025, we also have a pension asset of $
128
 million based on the funded status of certain plans. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and "Critical Accounting Estimates"

for further discussion of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments
We guarantee approximately 
4,500
 bank loans made to independent contractor distributors by third-party financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of the future payments under existing guarantees we could be required to make is $
570
 million as of August 3, 2025. Our guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. We do not expect that we will be required to make material guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed.
These obligations and commitments impact our liquidity and capital resource needs. We expect foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through anticipated cash flows from operations; long-term borrowings; short-term borrowings, which may include commercial paper; credit facilities; and cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our sources of financing will be adequate to meet our future requirements.
MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY
The principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, we are exposed to price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. We manage our foreign currency exposures by utilizing foreign exchange forward and option contracts. We enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts for periods consistent with related underlying exposures, and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. We manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and we may utilize interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. We principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. We also enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of wheat, diesel fuel, natural gas, soybean oil, cocoa, aluminum, soybean meal and corn. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments. 
The information below summarizes our market risks associated with significant financial instruments as of August 3, 2025. Fair values included herein have been determined based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. 
33 
The information presented below should be read in conjunction with Notes 13, 14 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, primarily the Canadian dollar and Euro, related to intercompany transactions and third-party transactions. We utilize foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge these exposures. The notional amounts of the contracts as of August 3, 2025, and July 28, 2024, were $596 million and $297 million, respectively. The aggregate fair value of all contracts was a loss of $1 million as of August 3, 2025, and a gain of $2 million as of July 28, 2024. A hypothetical 10% fluctuation in exchange rates would impact the fair value of our outstanding foreign exchange contracts by approximately $32 million as of August 3, 2025, and $16 million as of July 28, 2024, which would generally be offset by inverse changes on the underlying hedged items.
As of August 3, 2025, we had outstanding variable-rate debt of $332 million with an average interest rate of 4.69%. As of July 28, 2024, we had outstanding variable-rate debt of $650 million with an average interest rate of 6.20%. A hypothetical 100-basis-point increase in average interest rates applied to our variable-rate debt balances throughout 2025 and 2024 would have increased annual interest expense in those years by approximately $3 million and $7 million, respectively.
As of August 3, 2025, we had outstanding fixed-rate debt of $6.583 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.57%. As of July 28, 2024, we had outstanding fixed-rate debt of $6.584 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.38%. The fair value of fixed-rate debt was $6.213 billion as of August 3, 2025 and $6.216 billion as of July 28, 2024. As of August 3, 2025, and July 28, 2024, a hypothetical 100-basis-point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by approximately $367 million and $312 million, respectively, while a hypothetical 100-basis-point decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by approximately $417 million and $348 million, respectively. The impact of market interest rate fluctuations on our long-term debt does not affect our results of operations or financial position.
We manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by 
optimizin
g the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. From time to time, we may use interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. We manage our exposure to interest volatility on future debt issuances by entering into forward starting interest rate swaps or treasury lock contracts to hedge the rate on the interest payments related to the anticipated debt issuance. There were 
no
 forward starting interest rate swaps or treasury lock contracts outstanding as of August 3, 2025 and July 28, 2024. In conjunction with the issuance of senior unsecured notes on October 2, 2024, due on March 23, 2035, we settled forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional value of $700 million at a gain of less than $1 million. We settled forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional value of $1.1 billion in March 2024 at a loss of $11 million. The gains and losses on these instruments were recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and will be recognized in Interest expense over the respective lives of the debt.
We enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts, and a supply contract under which prices for certain raw materials are established based on anticipated volume requirements to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations for commodities. As of August 3, 2025, the total notional amount of the contracts was $233 million, and the aggregate fair value of the contracts was a gain of $1 million. As of July 28, 2024, the total notional amount of the contracts was $248 million, and the aggregate fair value of the contracts was a loss of $10 million. A hypothetical 10% fluctuation in commodity prices would impact the fair value of our outstanding commodity contracts by approximately $23 million as of August 3, 2025, and $24 million as of July 28, 2024, which would generally be offset by inverse changes on the underlying hedged items.
We enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to the total return of certain deferred compensation obligations. The notional amount of the contracts was $
76
 million as of August 3, 2025, and $
71
 million as of July 28, 2024. The fair value of the contracts was a gain of $1 million as of August 3, 2025, and a gain of $3 million as of July 28, 2024. A hypothetical 10% fluctuation in equity price changes would impact the fair value of our outstanding swap contracts by $8 million as of August 3, 2025, and $7 million as of July 28, 2024, which would generally be offset by inverse changes on the underlying hedged items.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. The following areas all require the use of subjective or complex judgments, estimates and assumptions: 
Trade and consumer promotion programs — 
We offer various sales incentive programs to customers and consumers, such as feature price discounts, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees and coupons. The mix between these forms of variable consideration, which are classified as reductions in revenue and recognized upon sale, and advertising or other marketing activities, which are classified as marketing and selling expenses, fluctuates between periods based on our overall marketing plans. The measurement and recognition of the costs for trade and consumer 
34 
promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors, including expected volume. Typically, programs that are offered have a very short duration. Historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements. Differences between estimates and actual costs are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period. However, actual expenses may differ if the level of redemption rates and performance were to vary from estimates. Accrued trade and consumer promotion liabilities as of August 3, 2025 and July 28, 2024 were $159 million and $186 million, respectively.
Valuation of long-lived assets — 
Fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable. If impairment is determined to exist, the charge is calculated based on estimated fair value.
Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually in the fourth quarter for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a quantitative impairment test. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average costs of capital and future economic and market conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill in the reporting unit.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined using a relief from royalty valuation method based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average costs of capital and assumed royalty rates. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the asset to fair value.
2024 Assessments
In the fourth quarter of 2024, we recognized an impairment charge of $
53
 million
 on certain salty snacks and cookie trademarks within our Snacks segment, including 
Tom’s
,
 Jays, Kruncher’s
,
 O-Ke-Doke
,
 Stella D’oro 
and
 Archway
,

collectively referred to as our "Allied brands." In 2024, sales and operating performance were below expectations due in part to competitive pressure and reduced margins. In the fourth quarter of 2024, based on recent performance and the reevaluation of the position of the Allied brands within our portfolio, we lowered our near-term and long-term outlook for future sales and operating performance, reducing the carrying value of the trademarks to $
43
 million.
In the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed an impairment assessment on the assets in our Pop Secret popcorn business within our Snacks segment as sales and operating performance were below expectations due in part to competitive pressure and reduced margins, and as we pursued divesting the business. As a result of these factors, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we lowered our long-term outlook for the business and recognized an impairment charge of $
76
 million
 on the trademark, reducing the carrying value of the trademark to $
28
 million. The sale of the business was completed on August 26, 2024.
2025 Assessments
As of August 3, 2025, the carrying value of goodwill was $4.991 billion. Based on our assessments, all of our reporting units had fair values that significantly exceeded carrying values.
During the second quarter of 2025, we performed an interim impairment assessment on our Allied brands trademarks as our sales performance was below expectations. In the second quarter of 2025, based on recent performance, we lowered our long-term outlook and recognized an impairment charge of $
15
 million
 on the trademarks, reducing the carrying value to $
28
 million.
During the second quarter of 2025, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the 
Late July 
trademark within our Snacks segment as our sales performance was below expectations. In the second quarter of 2025, based on recent performance, we lowered our long-term outlook and recognized an impairment charge of $
11
 million
 on the trademark, reducing the carrying value to $
47
 million.
During the third quarter of 2025, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the 
Snyder's of Hanover
 trademark within our Snacks segment as our sales and operating performance were below expectations. In the third quarter of 2025, based on recent performance, we lowered our long-term outlook and recognized an impairment charge of $
150
 million
 on the 
35 
trademark, reducing the carrying value to $
470
 million.

While the 1% changes in assumptions would not result in impairment charges on our other trademarks, some changes would result in a fair value exceeding carrying value by less than 15% for the

and
 Cape Cod 
trademarks.
The estimates of future cash flows used in impairment testing involve significant management judgment, and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, assumed royalty rates, economic conditions, market conditions and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as changes in capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance and economic conditions, including the potential impact of tariffs. If our assumptions change or market conditions decline, potential impairment charges could result. 
See also Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets.
Pension and postretirement benefits — 
We provide certain pension and postretirement benefits to employees and retirees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Independent actuaries, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, perform the required calculations to determine expense. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in Other expenses / (income) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as of the measurement date, which is our fiscal year end, or more frequently if an interim remeasurement is required. We use the fair value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on plan assets.
In establishing the discount rate, we review published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. We use a full yield curve approach to estimate service cost and interest cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used to determine the benefit obligation of the relevant projected cash flows.
The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering our current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management. Within any given fiscal period, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets. Gains and losses resulting from differences between actual experience and the assumptions are determined at each measurement date. 
36 
As of August 3, 2025, we have a pension liability of $98 million and a postretirement benefit obligation of $127 million. As of August 3, 2025, we also have a pension asset of $
128
 million based on the funded status of certain plans.
Net periodic pension and postretirement benefit expense (income) and actuarial losses (gains) included within net periodic pension and benefit expense (income) were as follows:

The actuarial losses recognized in 2025 were primarily due to gains on plan assets that were less than the expected return, partially offset by increases in the discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation and plan experience. The actuarial losses recognized in 2024 were primarily due to decreases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation and plan experience, partially offset by gains on plan assets. The actuarial gains recognized in 2023 were primarily due to increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation, partially offset by losses on plan assets and plan experience.

Postretirement
Discount rate for obligations
5.26
%
5.23
%
5.47%
Based on benefit obligations and plan assets as of August 3, 2025, estimated sensitivities to 2026 annual net periodic pension and postretirement cost are as follows: 
•
a 50-basis-point increase in the discount rate would result in expense of approximately $4 million and would result in an immediate actuarial gain recognition of approximately $39 million; 
•
a 50-basis-point decline in the discount rate would result in income of approximately $5 million and would result in an immediate actuarial loss recognition of approximately $43 million; and 
•
a 50-basis-point reduction in the estimated return on assets assumption would result in expense of approximately $6 million.
Contributions to pension plans were not material in 2025, 2024 and 2023 and are not expected to be material in 2026.
See also Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension and postretirement benefits.
Income taxes — 
The effective tax rate reflects statutory tax rates, tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and management’s estimate of the ultimate outcome of various tax audits and issues. Significant judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating tax positions. Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the effect of deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
See also Notes 1 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on income taxes.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
In this Report, unless otherwise stated, the terms "we," "us," "our" and the "company" refer to The Campbell's Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
We are a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality, branded food and beverage products.
Basis of Presentation
 — The consolidated financial statements include our accounts and entities in which we maintain a controlling financial interest. Intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest July 31. There were 
53
 weeks in 2025 and 
52
 weeks in 2024 and 2023. There will be 
52
 weeks in 2026.
Use of Estimates
 — Generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
 — Our revenues primarily consist of the sale of food and beverage products through our own sales force and/or third-party brokers and distribution partners. Revenues are recognized when our performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the product passes to our customers, which typically occurs when products are delivered. Shipping and handling costs incurred to deliver the product are recorded within Cost of products sold. Amounts billed and due from our customers are classified as Accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and require payment on a short-term basis. Revenues are recognized net of provisions for returns, discounts and certain sales promotion expenses, such as feature price discounts, in-store display incentives, cooperative advertising programs, new product introduction fees and coupon redemption costs. These forms of variable consideration are recognized upon sale. The recognition of costs for promotion programs involves the use of judgment related to performance and redemption estimates. Estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors, including expected volume. Historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements. Differences between estimates and actual costs are recognized as a change in estimate in a subsequent period. Revenues are presented on a net basis for arrangements under which suppliers perform certain additional services. See Note 7 for additional information on disaggregation of revenue.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
 — All highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.
Inventories
 — All inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value.
Property, Plant and Equipment
 — Property, plant and equipment are recorded at historical cost and are depreciated over estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Buildings and machinery and equipment are depreciated over periods not exceeding 
45
 years and 
20
 years, respectively. Assets are evaluated for impairment when conditions indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Such conditions include significant adverse changes in business climate or a plan of disposal. Repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
 — Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but rather are tested at least annually in the fourth quarter for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment. Goodwill is tested for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment for some or all reporting units and perform a quantitative impairment test. Fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow analyses. The discounted estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average costs of capital and future economic and market conditions. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, goodwill is considered impaired. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill in the reporting unit.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined using a relief from royalty valuation method based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average costs of capital and assumed royalty rates. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the asset to fair value.
Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if the carrying amount of the asset is recoverable. If impairment is determined to exist, the charge is calculated based on estimated fair value.
46 
See Note 6 for more information.
Leases — 
We determine if an agreement is or contains a lease at inception by evaluating if an identified asset exists that we control for a period of time. When a lease exists, we record a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a corresponding lease liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the corresponding liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments during the term. We have elected not to record leases with a term of 12 months or less on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
ROU assets are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at lease commencement based on the present value of the corresponding liabilities and are adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, or initial direct costs incurred. To calculate the present value of our lease liabilities, we use a country-specific collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term at commencement. The measurement of our ROU assets and liabilities includes all fixed payments and any variable payments based on an index or rate.
Our leases generally include options to extend or terminate use of the underlying assets. These options are included in the lease term used to determine ROU assets and corresponding liabilities when we are reasonably certain we will exercise.
Our lease arrangements typically include non-lease components, such as common area maintenance and labor. We account for each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single lease component for all underlying asset classes with the exception of certain production assets. Accordingly, all costs associated with a lease contract are disclosed as lease costs. This includes any variable payments that are not dependent on an index or a rate and which are expensed as incurred.
Operating leases expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term with the expense recorded in Cost of products sold, Marketing and selling expenses, or Administrative expenses depending on the nature of the leased item.
For finance leases, the amortization of ROU lease assets is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the underlying asset or the lease term in Cost of products sold, Marketing and selling expenses, or Administrative expenses depending on the nature of the leased item. Interest expense on finance lease obligations is recorded using the effective interest method over the lease term and is recorded in Interest expense.
All operating lease cash payments and interest on finance leases are recorded within Net cash provided by operating activities and all finance lease principal payments are recorded within Net cash used in financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
See Note 11 for more information.
Derivative Financial Instruments
 — We use derivative financial instruments primarily for purposes of hedging exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodities and equity-linked employee benefit obligations. We enter into these derivative contracts for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures, and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments. Our derivative programs include strategies that qualify and strategies that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged risk during the period that the hedge is designated. 
All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. For derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, we designate the derivative as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (fair-value hedge) or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash-flow hedge). Some derivatives may also be considered natural hedging instruments (changes in fair value act as economic offsets to changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item) and are not designated for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value on the portion of the derivative included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness of a fair-value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the underlying hedged asset or liability (including losses or gains on firm commitments), are recorded in current-period earnings. Changes in the fair value on the portion of the derivative included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness of cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. For derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in earnings under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument and is presented in the same statement of earnings line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Any difference between the change in the fair value of the hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and the amounts recognized in earnings is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting are recognized in current-period earnings.
Cash flows from derivative contracts are included in Net cash provided by operating activities.
47 
Advertising Production Costs 
— Advertising production costs are expensed in the period that the advertisement first takes place or when a decision is made not to use an advertisement.

Research and Development Costs
 — The costs of research and development are expensed as incurred. Costs include expenditures for new product and manufacturing process innovation, and improvements to existing products and processes. Costs primarily consist of salaries, wages, consulting, and depreciation and maintenance of research facilities and equipment.
Income Taxes
 — Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future impact of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.

2.   
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted
In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that enhances the transparency of supplier finance programs by requiring disclosure of the key terms of these programs and a related rollforward of these obligations to understand the effect on working capital, liquidity and cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods in those fiscal years, except for the rollforward requirement, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We adopted the guidance in the fourth quarter of 2023, with the exception of the rollforward information which was adopted in the fourth quarter of 2025. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 19 for additional information.
In November 2023, the FASB issued guidance to improve reportable segment disclosures, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. In addition, the guidance enhances interim disclosure requirements, clarifies circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provides new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment and contains other disclosure requirements. The purpose of the guidance is to enable investors to better understand an entity’s overall performance and assess potential future cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We adopted the guidance in the fourth quarter of 2025. The adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 7 for additional information.
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued guidance to improve income tax disclosures by requiring disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance should be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued guidance to improve disclosures by requiring additional details about specific types of expenses (purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization) included in certain expense captions. The guidance requires disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses and, on an annual basis, disclosure of the definition of selling expenses. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance should be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

Pop Secret 
trademark, which was divested with the sale of the business

in 2025. See Note 4 for additional information.

Includes the 
Late July 
and Allied brands trademarks.
Amortization expense was $
68
 million for 2025, $
73
 million for 2024 and $
48
 million for 2023. Amortization expense in 2025, 2024 and 2023 included accelerated amortization expense of $
20
 million, $
27
 million and $
7
 million, respectively, on customer relationships which began in the fourth quarter of 2023 due to the loss of certain contract manufacturing customers. As of August 3, 2025, amortizable intangible assets had a weighted-average remaining useful life of 
18
 years. Amortization expense is estimated to be approximately $
40
 million per year for the following five years.
In the fourth quarter of 2024, we recognized an impairment charge of $
53
 million
 on certain salty snacks and cookie trademarks within our Snacks segment, including 
Tom’s
,
 Jays
,
 Kruncher’s
,
 O-Ke-Doke
,
 Stella D’oro 
and
 Archway
,

collectively referred to as our "Allied brands." In 2024, sales and operating performance were below expectations due in part to competitive 
52 
pressure and reduced margins. In the fourth quarter of 2024, based on recent performance and the reevaluation of the position of the Allied brands within our portfolio, we lowered our near-term and long-term outlook for future sales and operating performance, reducing the carrying value of the trademarks to $
43
 million.
In the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed an impairment assessment on the assets in our Pop Secret popcorn business within our Snacks segment as sales and operating performance were below expectations due in part to competitive pressure and reduced margins, and as we pursued divesting the business. As a result of these factors, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we lowered our long-term outlook for the business and recognized an impairment charge of $
76
 million
 on the trademark, reducing the carrying value of the trademark to $
28
 million. The sale of the business was completed on August 26, 2024. 
During the second quarter of 2025, we performed an interim impairment assessment on our Allied brands trademarks as our sales performance was below expectations. In the second quarter of 2025, based on recent performance, we lowered our long-term outlook and recognized an impairment charge of $
15
 million
 on the trademarks, reducing the carrying value to $
28
 million.
During the second quarter of 2025, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the 
Late July 
trademark within our Snacks segment as our sales performance was below expectations. In the second quarter of 2025, based on recent performance, we lowered our long-term outlook and recognized an impairment charge of $
11
 million
 on the trademark, reducing the carrying value to $
47
 million.
During the third quarter of 2025, we performed an interim impairment assessment on the 
Snyder's of Hanover
 trademark within our Snacks segment as our sales and operating performance were below expectations. In the third quarter of 2025, based on recent performance, we lowered our long-term outlook and recognized an impairment charge of $
150
 million
 on the trademark, reducing the carrying value to $
470
 million.
The impairment charges were recorded in Other expenses / (income) in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.
As of the 2025 annual impairment testing, indefinite-lived trademarks with approximately 10% or less of excess coverage of fair value over carrying value had an aggregate carrying value of $
2.587
 billion and included

the 
Rao's
,
 Snyder's of Hanover
,
 Pace
,
 Pacific Foods
,
 Late July 
and Allied brands trademarks.
The estimates of future cash flows used in impairment testing involve significant management judgment and are based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance, assumed royalty rates, economic conditions, market conditions and cost of capital. Inherent in estimating the future cash flows are uncertainties beyond our control, such as changes in capital markets. The actual cash flows could differ materially from management’s estimates due to changes in business conditions, operating performance and economic conditions, including the potential impact of tariffs.

Our chief operating decision maker (CODM) is our President and Chief Executive Officer. Our CODM uses segment operating earnings as the profit measure in evaluating segment performance during the annual plan and forecasting process and 
53 
in monitoring actual performance versus plan. Segment operating earnings are comprised of earnings before interest, taxes and costs associated with restructuring activities, cost savings and optimization initiatives, impairment charges, accelerated amortization and corporate expenses. Unrealized gains and losses on outstanding undesignated commodity hedging activities are excluded from segment operating earnings and are recorded in Corporate as these open positions represent hedges of future purchases. Upon closing of the contracts, the realized gain or loss is transferred to segment operating earnings, which allows the segments to reflect the economic effects of the hedge without exposure to quarterly volatility of unrealized gains and losses. Only the service cost component of pension and postretirement expense is allocated to segments. All other components of expense, including interest cost, expected return on assets, amortization of prior service credits and recognized actuarial gains and losses are reflected in Corporate and not included in segment operating results. Asset information by segment is not discretely maintained for internal reporting or used in evaluating performance by the CODM. 
Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 
21
% of consolidated net sales in 2025 and 
22
% in 2024 and 2023. Both of our reportable segments sold products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates.

Restructuring Charges, Cost Savings Initiatives and Other Optimization Initiatives
Multi-year Cost Savings Initiatives and Snyder's-Lance, Inc. (Snyder's-Lance) Cost Transformation Program and Integration
Continuing Operations
Beginning in 2015, we implemented initiatives to reduce costs and to streamline our organizational structure. 
Over the years, we expanded these initiatives by continuing to optimize our supply chain and manufacturing networks, as well as our information technology infrastructure.
On March 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Snyder's-Lance. Prior to the acquisition, Snyder's-Lance launched a cost transformation program following a comprehensive review of its operations with the goal of significantly improving its financial performance. We continued to implement this program and identified opportunities for additional cost synergies as we integrated Snyder's-Lance.
In 2022, we expanded these initiatives as we continued to pursue cost savings by further optimizing our supply chain and manufacturing network and through effective cost management. In the second quarter of 2023, we announced plans to consolidate our Snacks offices in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Norwalk, Connecticut, into our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey.

As of July 28, 2024, we substantially completed the multi-year cost savings initiatives and Snyder's-Lance cost transformation program and integration. Certain phases that had not been fully implemented were incorporated into the 2025 cost savings initiatives described below.
Sovos Brands Integration Initiatives 
On March 12, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Sovos Brands. See Note 3 for additional information. We identified opportunities for cost synergies as we integrate Sovos Brands. 
In 2024, we recorded Restructuring charges of $
21
 million for severance pay and benefits related to initiatives to achieve the synergies. The charges incurred in 2024 were associated with the Meals & Beverages segment. 
In 2025, the initiatives to achieve synergies were incorporated into the cost savings initiatives described below.
2025 Cost Savings Initiatives
On September 10, 2024, we announced plans to implement cost savings initiatives beginning in 2025, including initiatives to further optimize our supply chain and manufacturing network, optimization of our information technology infrastructure and targeted cost management. We also identified additional opportunities for cost synergies as we integrate Sovos Brands. As mentioned above, we substantially completed our previous multi-year cost savings initiatives and Snyder's-Lance cost transformation program and integration. Certain initiatives from that program have been incorporated into our 2025 cost savings initiatives. Cost estimates for the 2025 initiatives, as well as timing for certain activities, are continuing to be developed.

The total estimated pre-tax costs for actions that have been identified to date are approximately $
215
 million, and we expect to incur substantially all of the costs through 2028. These estimates will be updated as the detailed plans are developed.
We expect the costs for the actions that have been identified to date to consist of the following: approximately $
30
 million in severance pay and benefits; approximately $
55
 million in asset impairment and accelerated depreciation; and approximately $
130
 million in implementation costs and other related costs. We expect these pre-tax costs to be associated with our segments as follows: Meals & Beverages - approximately 
71
%; Snacks - approximately 
11
% and Corporate - approximately 
18
%.
Of the aggregate $
215
 million of pre-tax costs identified to date, we expect approximately $
155
 million will be cash expenditures. In addition, we expect to invest approximately $
205
 million in capital expenditures, of which we invested $
147
 million as of August 3, 2025. The capital expenditures primarily relate to optimization of production within our manufacturing network, optimization of information technology infrastructure and applications and implementation of our existing SAP enterprise-resource planning system for Sovos Brands.

Pursuant to this initiative we will purchase certain Pepperidge Farm and Snyder's-Lance routes where there are opportunities to unlock greater scale in select markets, combine them and sell the combined routes to independent contractor distributors. We expect to execute this program in a staggered rollout and to incur expenses of up to approximately $
115
 million through 2029. In 2025, we incurred $
20
 million in Marketing and selling expenses and $
1
 million in Administrative expenses related to this initiative. In 2024, we incurred $
5
 million in Marketing and selling expenses related 
57 
to this initiative As of August 3, 2025, we have incurred $
25
 million in Marketing and selling expenses and $
1
 million in Administrative expenses related to this initiative.

Earnings per Share (EPS)
For the periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, the calculations of basic EPS and EPS assuming dilution vary in that the weighted average shares outstanding assuming dilution include the incremental effect of stock options and other share-based payment awards, except when such effect would be antidilutive. The earnings per share calculation for 2025 excludes approximately 
1
 million stock options that would have been antidilutive. The earnings per share calculation for 2024 and 2023 excludes less than 
1
 million stock options that would have been antidilutive.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits
Pension Benefits — 
We sponsor a number of noncontributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to eligible U.S. and non-U.S. employees. The benefits provided under these plans are based primarily on years of service and compensation levels. Benefits are paid from funds previously provided to trustees or are paid directly by us from general funds. In 1999, we implemented significant amendments to certain U.S. pension plans. Under a new formula, retirement benefits are determined based on percentages of annual pay and age. To minimize the impact of converting to the new formula, service and earnings credit continued to accrue for fifteen years for certain active employees participating in the plans under the old formula prior to the amendments. Employees will receive the benefit from either the new or old formula, whichever is higher. Effective as of January 1, 2011, our U.S. pension plans were amended so that employees hired or rehired on or after that date and who are not covered by collective bargaining agreements will not be eligible to participate in the plans. All collective bargaining units adopted this amendment by December 31, 2011.
In June 2023, we settled $
245
 million of our pension benefit obligations associated with approximately 
6,000
 retired participants that were receiving benefits within our U.S. defined benefit pension plans. A group annuity contract was purchased on behalf of these participants with a third-party insurance provider and funded directly by $
241
 million from the assets of our pension plans, resulting in an actuarial gain of $
4
 million. 
Postretirement Benefits — 
We provide postretirement benefits, including health care and life insurance to eligible retired U.S. employees, and where applicable, their dependents. Accordingly, we sponsor a retiree medical program for eligible retired U.S. employees and fund applicable retiree medical accounts intended to provide reimbursement for eligible health care expenses on a tax-favored basis for retirees who satisfy certain eligibility requirements. Effective as of January 1, 2019, we no longer sponsor our own retiree medical coverage for substantially all retired U.S. employees that are Medicare eligible. Instead, we offer these Medicare-eligible retirees access to health care coverage through a private exchange and offer a health reimbursement account to subsidize benefits for a select group of such retirees. We also provide postretirement life insurance to all eligible U.S. employees who retired prior to January 1, 2018, as well as certain eligible retired employees covered by one of our collective bargaining agreements who retired prior to January 1, 2023.
Determining net periodic benefit expense (income) is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care trend rates. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized immediately in Other expenses / (income) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as of the measurement date, which is our fiscal year end, or more frequently if an interim remeasurement is required. We use the fair value of plan assets to calculate the expected return on plan assets.

The components of net periodic benefit expense (income) other than the service cost component are included in Other expenses / (income) in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
The pension actuarial losses recognized in 2025 were primarily due to gains on plan assets that were less than the expected return, partially offset by increases in the discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation. The pension actuarial losses recognized in 2024 were primarily due to decreases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation and plan 
58 
experience, partially offset by gains on plan assets. The pension actuarial gains recognized in 2023 were primarily due to increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation and the gain from the annuity settlement, partially offset by losses on plan assets and plan experience.
The postretirement actuarial gains recognized in 2025 were primarily due to plan experience. The postretirement actuarial gains recognized in 2023 were primarily due to increases in discount rates used to determine the benefit obligation.

The discount rate is established as of the measurement date. In establishing the discount rate, we review published market indices of high-quality debt securities, adjusted as appropriate for duration. In addition, independent actuaries apply high-quality bond yield curves to the expected benefit payments of the plans. The expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption based upon historical experience and expected future performance, considering our current and projected investment mix. This estimate is based on an estimate of future inflation, long-term projected real returns for each asset class and a premium for active management. 
The discount rate used to determine net periodic postretirement expense was

Pension Plan Assets 
The fundamental goal underlying the investment policy is to ensure that the assets of the plans are invested in a prudent manner to earn a rate of return over time to meet the obligations of the plans as these obligations come due. The primary investment objectives include providing a total return which will promote the goal of benefit security by attaining an appropriate ratio of plan assets to plan obligations, to provide for real asset growth while also tracking plan obligations, to diversify investments across and within asset classes, to reduce volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, and to follow investment practices that comply with applicable laws and regulations. 
The primary policy objectives will be met by investing assets to achieve a reasonable tradeoff between return and risk relative to plan obligations, including investing a portion of the assets in funds selected in part to hedge the interest rate sensitivity to plan obligations. 
The portfolio includes investments in the following asset classes: fixed income, equity, real estate and alternatives. Fixed income investments provide a moderate expected return and hedge the exposure to interest rate risk of the plans’ obligations. Equities are used for their high expected return. Additional asset classes are used to provide diversification. 
Asset allocation is monitored on an ongoing basis relative to the established asset class targets. The interaction between plan assets and benefit obligations is periodically studied to assist in the establishment of strategic asset allocation targets. A key element of our investment strategy is to reduce our funded status risk in part through appropriate asset allocation within our plan assets. The investment policy permits variances from the targets within certain parameters. Asset rebalancing occurs when the underlying asset class allocations move outside these parameters, at which time the asset allocation is rebalanced back to the policy target weight.

Pension plan assets are categorized based on the following fair value hierarchy: 
•
Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
•
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with observable market data.
•
Level 3: Unobservable inputs, which are valued based on our estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Defined Contribution Plans — 
We sponsor a 401(k) Retirement Plan that covers substantially all U.S. employees and provide a matching contribution of 
100
% of employee contributions up to 
4
% of eligible compensation. In addition, for employees not eligible to participate in defined benefit plans that we sponsor, we provide a contribution equal to 
3
% of eligible compensation regardless of their participation in the 401(k) Retirement Plan. Amounts charged to Costs and expenses were $
77

The increase in 2024 is associated with the acquisition of Sovos Brands.
On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) was signed into law. The OBBBA makes certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 permanent and makes changes to some U.S. corporate tax provisions, many of which have different effective dates. The provisions of the OBBBA did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in 2025. We do not expect the OBBBA to have a material impact on our effective tax rate. However, we do anticipate future cash tax benefits due to changes in the tax laws for depreciation and research and development expenses.
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law. The IRA introduces a corporate alternative minimum tax beginning in 2024, a 1% excise tax on share repurchases in excess of issuances after January 1, 2023, and several tax incentives to promote clean energy. Any excise tax incurred is recognized as part of the cost basis of the shares acquired in the Consolidated Statements of Equity. The provisions of the IRA did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

As of August 3, 2025, our U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries had tax loss carryforwards of approximately $
114
 million. Of these carryforwards, $
10
 million may be carried forward indefinitely, and $
104
 million expire between 2026 and 2044, with the majority expiring after 2028. As of August 3, 2025, our net deferred liability included $
5
 million of tax effected loss carryforwards, of which $
3
 million was offset by a deferred tax asset valuation allowance.  Additionally, as of August 3, 2025, our U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries had capital loss carryforwards of approximately $
98
 million. Of these capital loss carryforwards, $
52
 million expire in 2026, and $
46
 million may be carried forward indefinitely. As of August 3, 2025, our net deferred liability included $
18
 million of tax effected capital loss carryforwards, all of which was offset by a deferred tax asset valuation allowance.
The net change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2025 was a decrease of $
6
 million. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of our Pop Secret popcorn business. The net change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2024 was a decrease of $
100
 million. The decrease was primarily due to the expiration of capital loss carryforwards in 2024. The net change in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance in 2023 was a decrease of $
2
 million. The decrease was primarily due to state tax loss carryforwards.
As of August 3, 2025, other deferred tax assets included $
3
 million of state tax credit carryforwards with the majority expiring between 2029 and 2039. As of August 3, 2025, deferred tax asset valuation allowances had been established to offset $
2
 million of the tax credit carryforwards.
As of August 3, 2025, we had approximately $
11
 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which are deemed to be permanently reinvested and for which we have not recognized a deferred tax liability. We estimate that the tax liability that might be incurred if permanently reinvested earnings were remitted to the U.S. would not be material. Foreign subsidiary earnings in 2021 and thereafter are not considered permanently reinvested and we have therefore recognized a deferred tax liability and expense.

The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the annual effective tax rate was $
15
 million as of August 3, 2025, $
14
 million as of July 28, 2024, and $
12
 million as of July 30, 2023. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits can change due to audit settlements, tax examination activities, statute expirations and the recognition and measurement criteria under accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. We reasonably expect reductions in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $
4
 million within the next 12 months due to settlement of tax examinations.
Our accounting policy for interest and penalties attributable to income taxes is to reflect any expense or benefit as a component of our income tax provision. The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings was not material in 2025, 2024, and 2023. The total amount of interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other liabilities was $
7
 million as of August 3, 2025, and $
6
 million as of July 28, 2024.
We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities, including the U.S. and Canada. With limited exceptions, we have been audited for income tax purposes in the U.S. through 2023 and in Canada through 2017. In addition, several state income tax examinations are in progress for the years 2017 to 2023.

As of August 3, 2025, we issued $
27

On April 16, 2024, we terminated our existing revolving credit facility dated September 27, 2021 (as amended on April 4, 2023). On 
April 16, 2024
, we entered into a Five-Year Credit Agreement for an unsecured, senior revolving credit facility (the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement) in an aggregate principal amount equal to $
1.85
 billion with a maturity date of 
April 16, 2029
, or such later date as extended pursuant to the terms set forth in the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement. On August 5, 2025, we entered into an Extension Agreement to extend the maturity date of the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement by one year from April 16, 2029 to 
April 16, 2030
. The 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement remained unused at August 3, 2025, except for $
1
 million of standby letters of credit that we issued under it. We may increase the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement commitments up to an additional $
500
 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. Loans under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement will bear interest at the rates specified in the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other conditions. The 2024 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement facility contains customary covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a 
minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of not less than 3.25:1.00, and customary events of default for credit facilities of this type
. The facility supports our commercial paper program and other general corporate purposes. We expect to continue to access the commercial paper markets, bank credit lines and utilize cash flows from operations to support our short-term liquidity requirements.    
We have $
400
 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes maturing in March 2026 that we expect to repay and/or refinance using available sources, which may include cash on hand, accessing the capital markets, commercial paper and/or revolving credit facility.

On 
November 15, 2022
, we entered into a delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement) totaling up to $
500
 million scheduled to mature on 
November 15, 2025
. Loans under the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement bear interest at the rates specified in the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other conditions. The 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a 
minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense (as each is defined in the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement) of not less than 3.25:1.00, and events of default for credit facilities of this type
. We borrowed $
500
 million under the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement on March 13, 2023, and used the proceeds and cash on hand to repay the 
3.65
% $
566
 million Notes that matured on March 15, 2023. On April 5, 2024, we repaid $
100
 million of the $
500
 million outstanding under the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement. The remaining $
400
 million was repaid in October 2024 and November 2024 as described below.
On 
October 10, 2023
, we entered into the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement totaling up to $
2
 billion scheduled to mature on 
October 8, 2024
. Loans under the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement bear interest at the rates specified in the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement, which vary based on the type of loan and certain other conditions. The 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant with respect to a 
minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of consolidated adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense (as each is defined in the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement) of not less than 3.25:1.00, and events of default for credit facilities of this type
. The proceeds of the loans under the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement could only be used in connection with the acquisition of Sovos Brands and the payment of fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. On March 12, 2024, we borrowed 
68 
$
2
 billion under the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement and used the proceeds in order to fund the acquisition of Sovos Brands, along with the fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith.
In August 2023, we filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that registered an indeterminate amount of debt securities. Under the registration statement we may issue debt securities from time to time, depending on market conditions. 
On March 19, 2024, pursuant to the registration statement, we issued senior unsecured notes of $
2.5
 billion, consisting of:
•
$
400
 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 
5.30
% per annum, due 
March 20, 2026
, with interest payable semi-annually on each of March 20 and September 20 commencing September 20, 2024;
•
$
500
 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 
5.20
% per annum, due 
March 19, 2027
, with interest payable semi-annually on each of March 19 and September 19 commencing September 19, 2024;
•
$
600
 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 
5.20
% per annum, due 
March 21, 2029
, with interest payable semi-annually on each of March 21 and September 21 commencing September 21, 2024; and 
•
$
1
 billion aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 
5.40
% per annum, due 
March 21, 2034
, with interest payable semi-annually on each of March 21 and September 21 commencing September 21, 2024.
The notes contain customary covenants and events of default. If a change of control triggering event occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 
101
% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the purchase date. 
We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to repay the 
$
2
 billion of outstanding
 borrowings under the 2024 DDTL Credit Agreement used to fund the Sovos Brands acquisition, including fees and expenses in connection therewith, and the remainder of the net proceeds to repay commercial paper.
On October 2, 2024, pursuant to the registration statement, we completed the issuance of senior unsecured notes of $
1.15
 billion, consisting of:
•    $
800
 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 
4.75
% per annum, due 
March 23, 2035
, with interest payable semi-annually on each of March 23 and September 23 commencing March 23, 2025; and
•    $
350
 million aggregate principal amount of notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 
5.25
% per annum, due 
October 13, 2054
, with interest payable semi-annually on each of April 13 and October 13 commencing April 13, 2025.
The notes contain customary covenants and events of default. If a change of control triggering event occurs, we will be required to offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price equal to 
101
% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the purchase date. In October 2024, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes to repay $
200
 million of the $
400
 million outstanding under the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement due November 15, 2025 and a portion of our outstanding commercial paper. In November 2024, we repaid the remaining $
200
 million outstanding under the 2022 DDTL Credit Agreement. In March 2025, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes along with cash on hand and the issuance of commercial paper to repay a $
1.15
 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes that matured in March 2025.
14.  
Financial Instruments
The principal market risks to which we are exposed are changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. In addition, we are exposed to price changes related to certain deferred compensation obligations. In order to manage these exposures, we follow established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivative contracts such as swaps, rate locks, options, forwards and commodity futures. We enter into these derivative contracts for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures, and the contracts do not constitute positions independent of those exposures. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and do not use leveraged instruments. Our derivative programs include instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment and instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges.
69 
Concentration of Credit Risk
We are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate counterparty credit risk, we enter into contracts only with carefully selected, leading, credit-worthy financial institutions, and distribute contracts among several financial institutions to reduce the concentration of credit risk. We did not have credit risk-related contingent features in our derivative instruments as of August 3, 2025, or July 28, 2024.
We are also exposed to credit risk from our customers. During 2025, our largest customer accounted for approximately 
21
% of consolidated net sales. Our five largest customers accounted for approximately 
47
% of our consolidated net sales in 2025.
We closely monitor credit risk associated with counterparties and customers.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk, primarily the Canadian dollar and Euro, related to intercompany transactions and third-party transactions. We utilize foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge these exposures. The contracts are either designated as cash-flow hedging instruments or are undesignated. We hedge portions of our forecasted foreign currency transaction exposure with foreign exchange forward contracts for periods typically up to 
18
 months. The notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts accounted for as cash-flow hedges was $
183
 million as of August 3, 2025, and $
108
 million as of July 28, 2024. Changes in the fair value on the portion of the derivative included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness of cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. For derivatives that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the initial fair value of hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness is recognized in earnings under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument and is presented in the same statement of earnings line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Any difference between the change in the fair value of the hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and the amounts recognized in earnings is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). The notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts and option contracts that are not designated as accounting hedges was $
413
 million as of August 3, 2025, and $
189
 million as of July 28, 2024.
Interest Rate Risk
We manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by optimizing the use of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt. From time to time, we may use interest rate swaps in order to maintain our variable-to-total debt ratio within targeted guidelines. We manage our exposure to interest volatility on future debt issuances by entering into forward starting interest rate swaps or treasury lock contracts to hedge the rate on the interest payments related to the anticipated debt issuance. The forward starting interest rate swaps or treasury lock contracts are either designated as cash-flow hedging instruments or are undesignated. Changes in the fair value on the portion of the derivative included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness of cash-flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), and reclassified into Interest expense over the life of the debt issued. The change in fair value on undesignated instruments is recorded in Interest expense. In conjunction with the issuance of senior unsecured notes on October 2, 2024, due on March 23, 2035, we settled forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional value of $
700
 million at a gain of less than $
1
 million. We settled forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional value of $
1.1
 billion in March 2024 at a loss of $
11
 million. The gains and losses on these instruments were recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and will be recognized in Interest expense over the respective lives of the debt. There were 
no
 forward starting interest rate swaps or treasury lock contracts outstanding as of August 3, 2025 and July 28, 2024.
Commodity Price Risk
We principally use a combination of purchase orders and various short- and long-term supply arrangements in connection with the purchase of raw materials, including certain commodities and agricultural products. We also enter into commodity futures, options and swap contracts to reduce the volatility of price fluctuations of wheat, diesel fuel, natural gas, soybean oil, cocoa, aluminum, soybean meal and corn. Commodity futures, options and swap contracts are either designated as cash-flow hedging instruments or are undesignated. We hedge a portion of commodity requirements for periods typically up to 
18
 months. There were 
no
 commodity contracts designated as cash-flow hedges as of August 3, 2025 or July 28, 2024. The notional amount of commodity contracts not designated as accounting hedges was $
184
 million as of August 3, 2025, and $
200
 million as of July 28, 2024. The change in fair value on undesignated instruments is recorded in Cost of products sold.
We have a supply contract under which prices for certain raw materials are established based on anticipated volume requirements over a twelve-month period. Certain prices under the contract are based in part on certain component parts of the raw materials that are in excess of our needs or not required for our operations, thereby creating an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation. We net settle amounts due under the contract with our counterparty. The notional amount was approximately $
49
 million as of August 3, 2025, and $
48
 million as of July 28, 2024. The change in fair value on the embedded derivative is recorded in Cost of products sold.
70 
Deferred Compensation Obligation Price Risk
We enter into swap contracts which hedge a portion of exposures relating to the total return of certain deferred compensation obligations. These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Unrealized gains (losses) and settlements are included in Administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. We enter into these contracts for periods typically not exceeding 
12
 months. The notional amounts of the contracts as of August 3, 2025, and July 28, 2024, were $
76
 million and $
71
 million, respectively.

Fair Value Measurements
We categorize financial assets and liabilities based on the following fair value hierarchy:
•
Level 1: Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
•
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with observable market data.
•
Level 3: Unobservable inputs, which are valued based on our estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. When available, we use unadjusted quoted market prices to measure the fair value and classify such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, we base fair value upon internally developed models that use current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as 
72 
interest rates and currency rates. Included in the fair value of derivative instruments is an adjustment for credit and nonperformance risk.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
In addition to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, we are also required to measure certain items at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 
73 
In the fourth quarter of 2024, we recognized impairment charges on certain trademarks in our Snacks segment. In the second and third quarters of 2025, we performed interim impairment assessments on certain trademarks in our Snacks segment. See also Note 6 for additional information on the impairment charges.
Fair value was determined based on unobservable Level 3 inputs. The fair value of trademarks was determined based on discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant management assumptions such as expected revenue growth rates, assumed royalty rates and weighted-average costs of capital.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value. Cash equivalents represent fair value as these highly liquid investments have an original maturity of three months or less. There were 
no
 cash equivalents with fair value based on Level 2 inputs at August 3, 2025. There were $
25
 million of cash equivalents with fair value based on Level 2 inputs at July 28, 2024.
The fair value of short- and long-term debt was $
6.545
 billion at August 3, 2025, and $
6.866
 billion at July 28, 2024. The carrying value was $
6.857
 billion at August 3, 2025, and $
7.184
 billion at July 28, 2024. The fair value of long-term debt is principally estimated using Level 2 inputs based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates.

40
 million shares of Preferred stock, issuable in one or more classes, with or without par as may be authorized by the Board of Directors. 
No
 Preferred stock has been issued.
Share Repurchase Programs
In September 2021, the Board approved a strategic share repurchase program of up to $
500
 million (September 2021 program). The September 2021 program has no expiration date, but it may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the September 2021 program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions.
In September 2024, the Board authorized a new anti-dilutive share repurchase program of up to $
250
 million (September 2024 program) to offset the impact of dilution from shares issued under our stock compensation programs. The September 2024 program has no expiration date, but it may be discontinued at any time. Repurchases under the September 2024 program may be made in open-market or privately negotiated transactions. The September 2024 program replaced an anti-dilutive share repurchase program of up to $
250
 million that was approved by the Board in June 2021 and has been terminated. 
In 2025, we repurchased 
1.303
 million shares at a cost of $
62
 million pursuant to our anti-dilutive share repurchase program. In 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 
1.56
 million shares at a cost of $
67
 million and 
2.698
 million shares at a cost of $
142
 million, respectively. As of August 3, 2025, approximately $
198
 million remained available under the September 2024 program and approximately $
301
 million remained under the September 2021 program.

17.  
Stock-based Compensation
In 2005, shareholders approved the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of 
6
 million shares to satisfy awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, unrestricted stock, restricted stock/units (including performance restricted stock) and performance units. In 2008, shareholders approved an amendment to the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of authorized shares to 
10.5
 million and in 2010, shareholders approved another amendment to the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of authorized shares to 
17.5
 million. In 2015, shareholders approved the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of 
13
 million shares. Approximately 
6
 million of these shares were shares that were currently available under the 2005 plan and were incorporated into the 2015 Plan upon approval by shareholders. In 2022, shareholders approved the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of 
12
 million shares to satisfy awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, unrestricted stock, restricted stock/units (including performance restricted stock) and performance units. The 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan replaced the 2015 Long-Term 
74 
Incentive Plan and no new awards can be granted under the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan and 
none
 of the shares that remain available under the 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan are available for issuance under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. 
Awards under Long-Term Incentive Plans may be granted to employees and directors. Pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan, we adopted a long-term incentive compensation program which provides for grants of total shareholder return (TSR) performance restricted stock/units, EPS performance restricted stock/units, strategic performance restricted stock/units, time-lapse restricted stock/units, special performance restricted stock/units, free cash flow (FCF) performance restricted stock/units and unrestricted stock. Under the program, awards of TSR performance restricted stock/units will be earned by comparing our total shareholder return during a 
three-year
 period to the respective total shareholder returns of companies in a performance peer group. Based upon our ranking in the performance peer group after the relevant three-year performance period, a recipient of TSR performance restricted stock/units may earn a total award ranging from 
0
% to 
200
% of the initial grant. Awards of EPS performance restricted stock/units granted beginning in 2022 will be earned upon the achievement of our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate goal (EPS CAGR performance restricted stock/units), measured over a 
three-year
 period. A recipient of EPS CAGR performance restricted stock/units may earn a total award ranging from 
0
% to 
200
% of the initial grant. Awards of EPS performance restricted stock/units granted prior to 2022 were earned based upon our achievement of annual earnings per share goals and vested over the relevant three-year period. During the 
three-year
 vesting period, a recipient of EPS performance restricted stock/units earned a total award of either 
0
% or 
100
% of the initial grant. Awards of the strategic performance restricted stock units were earned based upon the achievement of two key metrics, net sales and EPS growth, compared to strategic plan objectives during a 
three-year
 period. A recipient of strategic performance restricted stock units earned a total award ranging from 
0
% to 
200
% of the initial grant. Awards of FCF performance restricted stock units were earned based upon the achievement of free cash flow (defined as Net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and certain investing and financing activities) compared to annual operating plan objectives over a 
three-year
 period. An annual objective was established each fiscal year for three consecutive years. Performance against these objectives was averaged at the end of the three-year period to determine the number of underlying units that vested at the end of the three years. A recipient of FCF performance restricted stock units earned a total award ranging from 
0
% to 
200
% of the initial grant. Awards of time-lapse restricted stock/units will vest ratably over the 
three-year
 period. In addition, we may issue special grants of restricted stock/units to attract and retain executives which vest over various periods. Awards are generally granted annually in October. 
Stock options are granted on a selective basis under the Long-Term Incentive Plans. The term of a stock option granted under these plans may not exceed 
ten years
 from the date of grant. The option price may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of the grant. Options granted under these plans generally vest ratably over a 
three-year
 period. In 2019, we also granted certain options that vest at the end of a three-year period. We last issued stock options in 2019.
In 2025, we issued time-lapse restricted stock units, unrestricted stock, TSR performance restricted stock units and EPS CAGR performance restricted stock units. We last issued FCF performance restricted stock units in 2019, EPS performance restricted stock units in 2018, strategic performance restricted stock units in 2014 and special performance restricted units in 2015.
In connection with the Sovos Brands acquisition, in the third quarter of 2024, we issued 
1.721
 million time-lapse restricted stock units (Replacement units) in exchange for certain Sovos Brands restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units. The Replacement units are subject to the same terms and conditions of the original Sovos Brands restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units. Certain Replacement units were subject to accelerated vesting. The Replacement units have a total fair value of $
74
 million based on the quoted price of our stock on the acquisition date. The portion of Replacement units attributed to pre-combination service was $
42
 million, which was accounted for as part of consideration transferred and was recorded in Additional Paid-in Capital in our Consolidated Statements of Equity in the third quarter of 2024. See Note 3 for additional information. The portion of the Replacement units attributable to post-combination service will be recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the remaining vesting period.
In determining stock-based compensation expense, we estimate forfeitures expected to occur.

Total pre-tax stock-based compensation expense and tax-related benefits recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings were as follows:

We determine the fair value of time-lapse restricted stock units and EPS CAGR performance restricted stock units based on the quoted price of our stock at the date of grant. We expense time-lapse restricted stock units and EPS CAGR performance restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, except for awards issued to retirement-eligible participants and certain Replacement units, which we expense on an accelerated basis. There were 
809
 thousand EPS CAGR performance target grants outstanding at August 3, 2025, with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $
45.19
. The actual number of EPS CAGR performance restricted stock units that vest will depend on actual performance achieved. We estimate expense based on the number of awards expected to vest. In connection with the Sovos Brands acquisition, in 2024, our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate goals for the EPS CAGR performance restricted stock units granted in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were revised to equitably adjust for the impact of completed acquisitions and divestitures that were not contemplated at the time of approval of the original targets. In connection with the divestiture of our Pop Secret popcorn business, in the first quarter of 2025, our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate goals for the EPS performance restricted stock units granted in 2024 and 2023 were similarly revised. In connection with the divestiture of our noosa yoghurt business in the third quarter of 2025, our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate goals for the EPS performance restricted stock units granted in 2025, 2024, and 2023 were again similarly revised.
As of August 3, 2025, total remaining unearned compensation related to nonvested time-lapse restricted stock units and EPS CAGR performance restricted units was $
40
 million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining service period of 
1.7
 years. In the first quarter of 2025, recipients of EPS CAGR performance restricted stock units earned 
100
% of the initial grants based upon performance achieved during a three-year period ended July 28, 2024. The fair value of restricted stock units vested during 2025, 2024 and 2023 was $

37

18.  
Commitments and Contingencies
Regulatory and Litigation Matters
We are involved in various pending or threatened legal or regulatory proceedings, including purported class actions, arising from the conduct of business both in the ordinary course and otherwise. Modern pleading practice in the U.S. permits considerable variation in the assertion of monetary damages or other relief. Jurisdictions may permit claimants not to specify the monetary damages sought or may permit claimants to state only that the amount sought is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the trial court. In addition, jurisdictions may permit plaintiffs to allege monetary damages in amounts well exceeding reasonably possible verdicts in the jurisdiction for similar matters. This variability in pleadings, together with our actual experiences in litigating or resolving through settlement numerous claims over an extended period of time, demonstrates to us that the monetary relief which may be specified in a lawsuit or claim bears little relevance to its merits or disposition value.
Due to the unpredictable nature of litigation, the outcome of a litigation matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular points in time is normally difficult to ascertain. Uncertainties can include how fact finders will evaluate documentary evidence and the credibility and effectiveness of witness testimony, and how trial and appellate courts will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal. Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the relevant evidence and applicable law.
77 
On March 20, 2024, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and National Education Law Center, on behalf of Environment America and Lake Erie Waterkeeper, filed lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio – Western Division concerning alleged violations of the Clean Water Act relating to alleged contaminant discharges from our Napoleon, Ohio wastewater treatment facility in excess of the facility’s Clean Water Act permit limits. We have and are continuing to take actions to remediate the exceedances and are in settlement discussions with the DOJ and the private environmental groups while litigation proceedings are ongoing. While we cannot predict with certainty the amount of any civil penalty or the timing of the resolution of this matter, we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve this matter will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
We establish liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when information related to the loss contingencies shows both that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. It is possible that some matters could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures or establish accruals in amounts that could not be reasonably estimated as of August 3, 2025. While the potential future charges could be material in a particular quarter or annual period, based on information currently known by us, we do not believe any such charges are likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
Other Contingencies
We guarantee approximately 
4,500
 bank loans made to independent contractor distributors by third-party financial institutions for the purchase of distribution routes. The maximum potential amount of the future payments under existing guarantees we could be required to make is $
570
 million as of August 3, 2025. Our guarantees are indirectly secured by the distribution routes. We do not expect that we will be required to make material guarantee payments as a result of defaults on the bank loans guaranteed. The amounts recognized as of August 3, 2025, and July 28, 2024, were not material. 
We have provided certain indemnifications in connection with divestitures, contracts and other transactions. Certain indemnifications have finite expiration dates. Liabilities recognized based on known exposures related to such matters were not material at August 3, 2025, and July 28, 2024.
19.  
Supplier Finance Program Obligations
To manage our cash flow and related liquidity, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, including the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with our suppliers, which we deem to be commercially reasonable, generally range from 
0
 to 
120
 days. We also maintain agreements with third-party administrators that allow participating suppliers to track payment obligations from us, and, at the sole discretion of the supplier, sell those payment obligations to participating financial institutions. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. Supplier participation in these agreements is voluntary. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to enter into these agreements and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions. We have not pledged assets as security or provided any guarantees in connection with these arrangements. The payment of these obligations is included in cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The rollforward of our outstanding obligations confirmed as valid under our supplier finance program, which are included in 
Accounts payable

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The management of The Campbell's Company (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. 
The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: 
•
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
•
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and Directors of the Company; and
•
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well defined, may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of August 3, 2025. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
. Based on this assessment using those criteria, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 3, 2025. 
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of August 3, 2025 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears on the next page.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of The Campbell's Company
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Campbell's Company and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of August 3, 2025 and July 28, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended August 3, 2025, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended August 3, 2025 appearing on page 92 (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 3, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 3, 2025 and July 28, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 3, 2025 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 3, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective 
i
nternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A
 company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Tests for Certain Trademarks
As described in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s indefinite-lived trademarks were $3.678 billion as of August 3, 2025. Of the carrying value of all indefinite-lived trademarks, $1.470 billion related to the 
Rao’s
 trademark, $470 million related to the 
Snyder's of Hanover 
trademark, $318 million related to the 
Kettle Brand 
trademark, and $280 million related to the 
Pacific Foods 
trademark. Management conducts a test at least annually in the fourth quarter for impairment, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may be impaired. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to the carrying value. Fair value is determined using a relief from royalty valuation method based on discounted cash flow analyses that include significant assumptions such as revenue growth rates, weighted average costs of capital and assumed royalty rates. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, an impairment charge will be recorded to reduce the asset to fair value. In the third quarter of 2025, based on recent performance of the 
Snyder’s of Hanover 
brand, management lowered its long-term outlook and recognized an impairment charge of $150 million on the trademark.
T
he principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests for certain trademarks is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of certain trademarks; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to the revenue growth rates and weighted average costs of capital for the 
Rao’s 
and
 Snyder’s of Hanover 
trademarks and the assumed royalty rates for the 
Rao’s
,
 Snyder's of Hanover
, 
Kettle Brand
, and 
Pacific Foods 
trademarks; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests for certain trademarks. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of certain trademarks; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the relief from royalty valuation method; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the relief from royalty valuation method; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to the revenue growth rates and weighted average costs of capital for the 
Rao’s 
and
 Snyder’s of Hanover 
trademarks and the assumed royalty rates for the 
Rao’s
, 
Snyder's of Hanover
, 
Kettle Brand
, and 
Pacific Foods 
trademarks. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to the revenue growth rates and the assumed royalty rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the certain trademarks; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the relief from royalty valuation method and the reasonableness of the weighted average costs of capital and assumed royalty rate assumptions.
