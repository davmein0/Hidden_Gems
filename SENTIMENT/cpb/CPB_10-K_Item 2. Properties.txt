Ingredients, Packaging and Finished Products
The ingredients and packaging materials required for the manufacture of our food and beverage products are purchased from various suppliers, substantially all of which are located in North America. We also purchase finished products from domestic and international suppliers. Many of these items are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including but not limited to geopolitical conflicts, shifting global trade policies (including tariffs and retaliatory measures), import and export requirements, product scarcity, demand for raw materials, commodity market speculation, energy costs, currency fluctuations, supplier capacities, government-sponsored agricultural programs and other government policy, climate change, changes in crop size, cattle cycles, herd and flock disease, crop disease, crop pests, drought and excessive rain, temperature extremes and other adverse weather events, water scarcity, scarcity of suitable agricultural land, scarcity of organic ingredients, pandemics or other local or global health issues, environmental and other sustainability regulations and other factors that may be beyond our control. To help reduce some of this price volatility, we use a combination of purchase orders, short- and long-term contracts, inventory management practices, alternative sourcing opportunities, supplier collaboration, various commodity risk management tools for most of our ingredients and packaging and other cost mitigation efforts, as applicable. Ingredient inventories are generally at a peak during the late fall and decline during the winter and spring. Since many ingredients of suitable quality are available in sufficient quantities only during certain seasons, we make commitments for the purchase of such ingredients in their respective seasons.
During 2025, we experienced some volatility in commodity and supply chain costs, including the costs of labor, raw materials, energy, fuel, packaging materials and finished products, with a moderate impact from tariffs in the fourth quarter. We are unable to predict the extent to which tariffs may impact our ability to source ingredients, packaging materials and finished products in the future, and certain supply pressures may continue throughout 2026. In 2026, we expect more significant cost pressures primarily driven by tariff impacts. We plan to reduce some of these costs and impacts over time through cost savings initiatives, inventory management practices, supplier collaboration, alternative sourcing opportunities, continued supply chain productivity initiatives, surgical pricing actions where necessary and other mitigation efforts.
Customers
In most of our markets, sales and merchandising activities are conducted through our own sales force and/or third-party brokers and distribution partners. Our products are generally resold to consumers through retail food chains, mass discounters, mass merchandisers, club stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, e-commerce and other retail, commercial and non-commercial establishments. Our Snacks segment has a direct-store-delivery distribution model that uses independent contractor distributors. 
Our five largest customers accounted for approximately 
47
% of our consolidated net sales in 2025, 2024, and 2023. Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 
21
% of our consolidated net sales in 2025 and 
22
% in 2024 and 2023. Both of our reportable segments sold products to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. or its affiliates. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales.
Trademarks and Technology
As of September 10, 2025, we owned over 3,000 trademark registrations and applications in over 150 countries. We believe our trademarks are of material importance to our business. Although the laws vary by jurisdiction, trademarks generally remain valid and can be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and they have not become generic. We believe that our principal brands, including

are protected by trademark law in the major markets where they are used.
Although we own a number of valuable patents, we do not regard any segment of our business as being dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. In addition, we own copyrights, both registered and unregistered, proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry and experience competition in all of our categories. This competition arises from numerous competitors of varying sizes across multiple food and beverage categories, and includes producers of private label products, as well as other branded food and beverage manufacturers. Private label products are generally sold at lower prices than branded products. Competitors market and sell their products through traditional retailers and e-commerce. All of these competitors vie for trade merchandising support and consumer dollars. The number of competitors cannot be reliably estimated. Our principal areas of competition are brand recognition, taste, nutritional value, price, promotion, innovation, shelf space and customer service.

Capital Expenditures
During 2025, our aggregate capital expenditures were $426 million. We expect to spend approximately $420 million for capital projects in 2026. Major capital projects based on planned spend in 2026 include network optimization for both our Meals & Beverages and Snacks businesses, information technology projects and wastewater initiatives. We estimate that approximately $35 million of the capital expenditures anticipated during 2026 will be for upgrades to our Napoleon, Ohio wastewater treatment facility, with another approximately $20 million for other network wastewater initiatives.
Government Regulation
The manufacture and sale of consumer food products is highly regulated. In the U.S., our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Labor, the Department of Commerce, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as various state and local agencies. Our business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of the U.S. Additionally, we are subject to food ingredients regulations (including but not limited to Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C) colors), labeling and packaging regulations (including but not limited to extended producer responsibility (EPR) regulations), data privacy and security regulations, tax and securities regulations, import regulations, accounting and reporting standards, and other financial laws and regulations. We believe that we are in compliance with current laws and regulations in all material respects and do not expect that continued compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position.
Environmental Matters
Of our $426 million in capital expenditures made during 2025, approximately $26 million were for compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. We further estimate that approximately $35 million of the capital expenditures anticipated during 2026 will be for upgrades to our Napoleon, Ohio wastewater treatment facility, with another approximately $20 million for other network wastewater initiatives. Additionally, we anticipate spending approximately $6 million for compliance with U.S. environmental laws and regulations during 2026. We believe that the continued compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations (both within the U.S. and elsewhere) will not have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position. In addition, we continue to monitor existing and pending environmental laws and regulations within the U.S. and elsewhere relating to climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, energy and sustainability, including EPR laws and regulations. While the impact of these laws and regulations cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding certain environmental matters.
Seasonality
Demand for soup products is seasonal, with the fall and winter months usually accounting for the highest sales volume.

Demand for our other products is generally evenly distributed throughout the year.
Human Capital Management
One of the four pillars of our strategic framework is to build a Top Team. To do this, we are committed to building a company where everyone is valued and supported to do their best work. We believe that our employees are the driving force behind our success. Prioritizing attracting, developing and retaining world-class talent and cultivating a culture of belonging embodies our purpose, 
Connecting people through food they love.
 This approach also aligns with our Employee Value Proposition, 
Make history with Campbell’s
, to enhance our focus on building a winning team and culture. In accordance with our purpose and Employee Value Proposition, we have brought together all of our corporate team members from our Snacks offices in Charlotte, North Carolina and Norwalk, Connecticut to our headquarters in Camden, New Jersey. This move has helped to foster closer collaboration and enhance decision-making, thereby enabling us to execute our business strategy. We have also invested in other work experiences and wellness areas in our field locations. On August 3, 2025, we had approximately 13,700 full-time and part-time employees.
Training, Development and Engagement
We invest in our employees through training and development programs to support our culture of continuous learning. Our developmental programs allow employees to focus on timely and topical development areas including leadership excellence, change management and functional capabilities. We communicate frequently and transparently with our employees through regular company-wide and business unit check-ins, and we conduct employee engagement surveys that provide our employees with an opportunity to share anonymous feedback with management in a variety of areas including confidence in leadership, growth and career opportunities, alignment of work and overall engagement.

Total Rewards
We provide market-based competitive compensation through our salary, annual incentive and long-term incentive programs, and a robust benefits package that promotes the overall well-being of our employees. We provide a variety of resources and services to help our employees plan for retirement and provide a 401(k) plan with immediate vesting. We benchmark and establish compensation structures based on competitive market data. Individual pay is based on various factors such as an employee's role, experience, job location and contributions. Performance discussions for salaried employees are conducted throughout the year to assess contributions and inform individual development plans. 
Wellness and Safety
Our employees' health, safety and well-being are our top priorities. We promote a strong culture of safety and prioritize keeping all our employees, contractors and visitors safe. To accomplish this, we employ comprehensive health, safety and environment management policies and standards throughout the organization. In addition, we strive to continuously improve our work processes, tools and metrics to reduce workplace injuries and enhance safety. 
We provide a workplace that develops, supports and motivates our people. Our Ways to Well-being Strategy provides information, education tools and resources to drive engagement and to help support our employees' physical, financial, professional, social and emotional well-being. As part of this focus on well-being, we emphasize the need for our employees to embrace healthy lifestyles and we offer a variety of wellness education opportunities for our employees. We continue to modernize our workspaces and have a hybrid work policy to allow office-based employees to work remotely several days per week.
