Each of the foregoing manufacturing facilities is company-owned, except the Tualatin, Oregon and Austin, Texas facilities, which are leased. We also maintain principal business unit offices in Doral, Florida; Hanover, Pennsylvania; and Mississauga, Canada. 
We also own and lease distribution centers across the U.S. We believe that our manufacturing and processing plants and distribution centers are well maintained and, together with facilities operated by our contract manufacturers, are generally adequate to support the current operations of the businesses.
