Total revenue and other income increased by $35.8 million, or 27%, to $167.1 million in 2024 compared to $131.3 million in 2023 primarily due to the $23.8 million increase in royalties. The increase in royalties in 2024 was primarily due to income from Qarziba financial royalty asset acquired in the third quarter of 2024 and an increase in sales of Travere Therapeutics’ Filspari. Captisol sales increased by $2.5 million to $30.9 million in 2024 compared to $28.4 million in 2023. The higher Captisol sales were due to the timing of customer orders. Contract revenue and other revenue increased by $9.5 million primarily due to milestone payments earned from Verona Pharma upon the approval and commercial launch of Ohtuvayre.
Revenue from intangible royalty assets is a function of our partners' product sales and the applicable royalty rate. Kyprolis royalty rate is under a tiered royalty rate structure with the highest being 3%. Evomela has a contractually fixed royalty rate of 20%. Teriparatide injection has a tiered gross profit share between 25% and 40% on sales that have been adjusted for certain deductible items as defined in the respective license agreement. The Rylaze and Vaxnuevance royalty rates are in the low single digits. Filspari has a fixed royalty rate of 9%.

Cost of Captisol increased year over year in 2024 primarily due to higher sales of Captisol during 2024 compared to 2023. 
At any one time, we are working on multiple programs. As such, we generally do not track our R&D expenses on a specific program basis. Our R&D expenses decreased by $3.1 million in 2024 compared to 2023, with the decrease primarily attributable to lower employee related expenses and lab supplies resulting from the Pelican spin-off in September 2023. The decrease was partially offset by additional costs associated with incubating the Pelthos business.
General and administrative expenses increased by $25.9 million in 2024 compared to 2023, with the increase primarily driven by higher stock-based compensation expenses for investments made in building out our business development and investment team. Additionally, a one-time, non-cash stock award modification expense related to the departure of Ligand's former Chief Operating Officer and costs associated with incubating the Pelthos Therapeutics business contributed to the increase.
Financial royalty asset impairment was $30.6 million for 2024 primarily due to Takeda's decision to discontinue the soticlestat program.
Fair value adjustment to partner program derivatives was $15.1 million for 2024 primarily due to certain Agenus partners discontinuing development of their partnered programs. These programs may be relicensed at a later date, and Ligand would retain its economic interest upon any relicense activity.
We do not provide forward-looking estimates of costs and time to complete our ongoing research and development projects as such estimates would involve a high degree of uncertainty. Uncertainties include our inability to predict the outcome of research and clinical studies, regulatory requirements placed upon us by regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA, our inability to predict the decisions of our partners, our ability to fund research and development programs, competition from other entities of which we may become aware in future periods, predictions of market potential for products that may be derived from our work, and our ability to recruit and retain personnel or third-party contractors with the necessary knowledge and skills to perform certain research.
