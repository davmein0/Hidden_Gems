Business
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company enabling scientific advancement through supporting the clinical development of high-value medicines. Ligand does this by providing financing, licensing our technologies or both. Our business model seeks to generate value for stockholders by creating a diversified portfolio of biopharmaceutical product revenue streams that are supported by an efficient and low corporate cost structure. Our goal is to offer investors an opportunity to participate in the promise of the biotech industry in a profitable and diversified manner. Our business model focuses on funding programs in mid- to late-stage drug development in return for economic rights, purchasing royalty rights in development stage or commercial biopharmaceutical products and licensing our technology to help partners discover and develop medicines. We partner with other pharmaceutical companies to leverage what they do best (late-stage development, regulatory management and commercialization) in order to generate our revenue. We operate two infrastructure-light royalty-generating IP platform technologies. Our Captisol platform technology is a chemically modified cyclodextrin with a structure designed to optimize the solubility and stability of drugs. Our NITRICIL platform technology facilitates “tunable” dosing, permitting an adjustable drug release profile to allow proprietary formulations that target a broad range of indications. We have established multiple alliances, licenses and other business relationships with the world’s leading biopharmaceutical companies including Amgen, Merck, Pfizer, Jazz, Gilead Sciences and Baxter.
Our revenue consists of three primary elements: royalties from commercialized products, sales of our Captisol material to partners, and contract revenue from license fees and milestones payments. 
Strategy and Execution
We are a biopharmaceutical royalty aggregator, focused on investing in differentiated late-stage assets and operating royalty-generating, infrastructure-light platform technologies. Since our transition to this business model in 2007, we have deployed over $1 billion of capital to build our diverse portfolio. In 2022, Ligand made a deliberate decision to focus on an efficient, high margin, low infrastructure version of our historical model. Following the spin-offs of our OmniAb antibody discovery business in November 2022 and the Pelican Expression Technology subsidiary in September 2023, our focus is to continue to expand our pipeline by aggregating royalty rights in mid- to late-stage development and commercial biopharma products, while maintaining a lean infrastructure and high-margin business. 
Our business model is highly differentiated from a traditional biotechnology company in several important ways. First, we have limited infrastructure requirements, enabling us to maintain relatively high operating margins. Second, we can enable development over a broad range of therapeutic areas and can be strategic and balanced about the size of our investments to achieve a highly diversified portfolio. Third, our business model mitigates the high volatility and risk associated with building a business around a single or small number of assets. With this approach, we have the ability to mitigate the impact of binary clinical outcomes inherent in the biopharmaceutical industry, thereby facilitating cash flows that are more predictable. Finally, we can target the size of our investments to achieve appropriate risk management across the portfolio.
As an organization, we bring a highly experienced team and financial strength to execute on our strategy. There is high demand for capital and low availability of structured capital in the segment of the biopharmaceutical market in which we operate, creating significant investment opportunities for Ligand. Unlike open-market equity investing, many of our investments take place under Confidential Disclosure Agreements (CDAs), allowing us access to in-depth, advantageous diligence materials. Our flexible investment structures are designed to mitigate risks and help accommodate different transaction structures in line with our partners' goals. We believe our business model is highly scalable and has significant growth potential. We have assembled a talented, long-tenured team with deep industry relationships, investment experience and industry knowledge. 
From a more tactical perspective, we execute our strategy using four key approaches: royalty monetization, special situations, project finance, and IP technology platform investments. With royalty monetization, we purchase rights on existing royalty contracts that are owned by inventors, academic institutions or companies. There are advantages of royalty investing as a model since royalties 1) require minimal infrastructure, 2) are non-dilutable and 3) their cash flows are often protected in bankruptcy. In special situations investing, we can acquire or restructure companies with valuable assets or partnerships and realize the value of those assets by incubating and partnering the product assets, or holding preestablished royalty contracts/assets. Ligand has a track record of doing this successfully with investments such as:
•
Pharmacopeia acquisition in 2008, which yielded Travere’s Filspari
•
Metabasis acquisition in 2010, which contributed to the creation of Viking Therapeutics
•
Vernalis acquisition in 2018, which yielded Verona’s Ohtuvayre
•
Pfenex acquisition in 2020, which yielded five of our major commercial programs – Capvaxive, Vaxnuevance, Rylaze, Pneumosil, and Teriparatide, as well as our equity interest in Primrose Bio
2
•
Novan acquisition in 2023, which yielded ZELSUVMI
•
Apeiron acquisition in 2024, which yielded Qarziba
Project finance involves the provision of development capital to fund late-stage clinical programs in return for royalty contracts that we negotiate, creating synthetic royalties on the future sales of those products.

Finally, with IP technology platform acquisitions, we look for platforms that are infrastructure-light with existing royalties in place while providing the potential for new royalties through operating those platforms. Ideal technology IP platforms will be scalable and have broad applicability. Our Captisol and NITRICIL businesses are excellent examples of successful platform technology investments. 
We have a specific set of criteria we use to assess potential investments. The first is time to cash flow, as we seek products that are within a few years of regulatory approval and commercialization. Typically, this means we invest in Phase 3 assets, although we also evaluate opportunities to invest from Phase 2 assets to approved assets. In terms of an asset's clinical profile, we are looking for strong data supporting both efficacy and safety, and products which will ultimately deliver significant value to patients and to the healthcare system. We also look for strong market exclusivity, which can be achieved through intellectual property and/or regulatory protections. Structural alignment with our counterparty and the commercial counterparty is also a key criteria of the investments we make. Ultimately, we look for assets with favorable risk-reward profiles, which have above average probability of technical and regulatory success and can be commercialized effectively.

Technologies
Through a combination of research and acquisitions, we have created a partnered portfolio with a wide variety of underlying technologies. This diversification provides the added benefits of exposure to a wider breadth of scientific innovation, more licensing opportunities and lower impact of individual patent expiry.
Captisol Technology
Captisol is a patent-protected, chemically modified cyclodextrin with a structure designed to optimize the solubility and stability of drugs. This unique technology has enabled FDA-approved products, including Gilead’s Veklury, Amgen’s Kyprolis, Baxter’s Nexterone, and Acrotech Biopharma’s Evomela. There are many Captisol-enabled products currently in various stages of development. We maintain a broad global patent portfolio for Captisol with the latest expiration date in 2033. Other patent applications covering methods of making Captisol, if issued, extend the expiration date to 2041.
In addition to solid Captisol powder, we offer our partners access to cGMP manufactured aqueous Captisol concentrate. This product offering was established in 2017 to reduce cycle time and increase Captisol production capacity for large-volume drug products. We maintain both Type IV and Type V DMFs with the FDA. These DMFs contain manufacturing and safety information relating to Captisol that our licensees can reference when developing Captisol-enabled drugs. We also have active DMFs in Japan, China and Canada. 
NITRICIL Technology Platform
The NITRICIL technology platform was acquired through our Novan acquisition in 2023. This product leverages nitric oxide's naturally occurring antimicrobial and immunomodulatory effects to develop new therapies for unmet medical needs across multiple therapeutic areas. Our nitric oxide platform allows for “tunable” dosing, permitting an adjustable drug release profile to allow proprietary formulations that target a broad range of indications. NITRICIL is currently leveraged in one FDA approved product, ZELSUVMI. Clinical development success positions the NITRICIL platform well for future expansions into other indications.
HepDirect, LTP and BEPro Technology Platform
The HepDirect and LTP technology platforms are our proprietary liver-targeting prodrug technologies that can deliver many different chemical classes of drugs to the liver by using a chemical modification that renders an active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) biologically inactive until cleaved by a liver-specific enzyme. These technologies may improve the efficacy and/or safety of certain drugs and can be applied to marketed or new drug products to treat liver diseases or diseases caused by hemostasis imbalance of circulating molecules controlled by the liver. 
The BEPro technology platform is a next generation prodrug technology distinct from HepDirect and LTP prodrug technologies, expanding use to non-liver related diseases. BEPro is specifically applicable to nucleotides and nucleotide analogs 
4
for the development of compounds with improved product profiles. Ligand has demonstrated benefits in cell penetration and oral, intravenous and inhaled pharmacokinetics with BEPro-enabled nucleotide analogs.
Pelican Expression Technology (owned by Primrose Bio, of which Ligand owns 31.4% as of December 31, 2024)
The Pelican Expression Technology platform is a robust, validated, cost-effective and scalable platform for recombinant protein production and is especially well suited for complex, large-scale proteins. Global manufacturers have demonstrated consistent success with the platform, and the technology is currently outlicensed for multiple commercial and development-stage programs. The versatility of the platform has been demonstrated in the production of enzymes, peptides, antibody derivatives and engineered non-natural proteins. The platform contributes significant value to biopharmaceutical development programs by shortening timelines and reducing costs associated with research and development through commercial manufacturing of therapeutics and vaccines. Given pharmaceutical industry trends toward large molecules with increased structural complexities, the Pelican Expression Technology platform is well positioned to meet these growing needs as one of the most comprehensive and broadly available, commercially validated protein production platforms in the industry. 
2024 and Recent Investment Highlights
On February 25, 2025, we announced that we entered into a royalty financing agreement with Castle Creek Biosciences, Inc., a late-stage cell and gene therapy company, to support Castle Creek’s D-Fi (FCX-007) Phase 3 clinical study. D-Fi is an injectable autologous gene-modified cell therapy in development for the treatment of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (“DEB”), candidate for the treatment of DEB, a devastating, painful, and debilitating rare genetic skin disorder. Under the terms of the agreement, we have invested $50 million in exchange for a mid-single digit royalty on worldwide sales of D-Fi and a portion of a future milestone payment upon D-Fi achieving FDA approval. An additional $25 million was secured from a syndicate of co-investors in return for a high-single digit royalty on worldwide sales of D-Fi. 
Throughout 2024 and into January of 2025, we acquired additional royalties from several Ohtuvayre inventors, bringing our total Ohtuvayre royalty to 3%.
In July 2024, we acquired Apeiron Biologics AG (“Apeiron”), which holds royalty rights to Qarziba (dinutuximab beta) for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma in patients aged 12 months and above, for $100 million. In addition, we agreed to pay Apeiron shareholders additional consideration based on future commercial and regulatory events, including up to $28 million if Qarziba royalties exceed certain predetermined thresholds by either 2030 or 2034, and pay additional earn-outs on specific future commercial and regulatory events. Qarziba was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2017 and is commercially available in more than 35 countries. We receive a tiered mid-teen royalty on sales of Qarziba from Recordati. See “
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note (3), Acquisitions.
”
In June 2024, following on our first two investments in 2018 and 2023, we invested an additional $2.5M in Palvella in the form of a convertible notes, which upon Pavella's merger with Pieris, converted to common shares of Pavella.
In May 2024, we committed $75 million to a royalty financing agreement (the “Agenus Agreement”) with Agenus intended to support Agenus’ key development initiatives in the ongoing botensilimab and balstilimab (“BOT/BAL”) clinical development program, including a Phase 3 trial in its lead indication of patients with metastatic, relapsed/refractory, microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer, not microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR), who are without active liver metastases (r/r MSS CRC NLM), along with other launch readiness activities. Under the terms of the Agenus Agreement, we paid $75 million to Agenus at closing. In addition, we have the option to invest an additional $25 million on the same terms on a pro rata basis. In return for our initial $75 million payment, we are entitled to receive 18.75% of future royalties and 31.875% of future milestone payments related to six of Agenus’ clinical-stage oncology programs. For five of these programs the partner has either returned, not exercised a license option or indicated they would no longer pursue development including BMS-986442, AGEN2373, INCAGN2385 and INCAGN2390 and MK-4830. UGN-301 is currently being evaluated in Phase 1 trials in bladder cancer by UroGen Pharma. Additionally, we will receive a 2.625% synthetic royalty on future global net sales generated by BOT/BAL. The royalties and milestone payments owed could be adjusted up or down based upon pre-determined future events and achievement of certain milestones. See 
“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note (2), Agenus Transaction.”
Novan Acquisition
In September 2023, the Bankruptcy Court approved a $12.2 million bid from Ligand to purchase certain assets of Novan, Inc. (“Novan”), including its lead product candidate berdazimer topical gel, 10.3% (“berdazimer gel”), all assets related to the NITRICIL technology platform and the rights to one development stage asset. Prior to Novan's bankruptcy, we had a royalty interest in berdazimer gel. Berdazimer gel was subsequently approved by the FDA in January 2024, with a brand name of ZELSUVMI. 
On April 3, 2024, Ligand announced the creation of Pelthos Therapeutics (“Pelthos”) under the leadership of Scott Plesha as Chief Executive Officer. Pelthos is focused on the commercialization of innovative, safe, and efficacious therapeutic products 
5
for patients suffering from conditions with limited treatment options. ZELSUVMI, its first product, is the first and only FDA-approved prescription medicine for the treatment of the highly transmissible molluscum contagiosum (molluscum) viral skin infection in adults and pediatric patients one year of age and older. It is the first and only FDA approved topical prescription medication for this infection that can be applied by patients, parents and caregivers at home, outside of a physician's office, or other medical setting. 
ZELSUVMI received a Novel Drug designation from the U.S. FDA in January 2024 to treat molluscum viral skin infection. ZELSUVMI was developed using Pelthos' proprietary nitric oxide-based NITRICIL technology platform. As we incubate this newly acquired business, the Pelthos team is actively preparing for a potential strategic transaction and subsequent commercial launch by mid-2025 of the assets acquired in the Novan acquisition (including ZELSUVMI and other assets that may be developed using the NITRICIL technology platform).  Consistent with our business model, we are engaging with potential commercial partners and outside investors to maximize the value of these assets for Ligand stockholders through a licensing or other strategic transaction involving Pelthos.

Kyprolis (Amgen, Ono, BeiGene)
We supply Captisol to Amgen for use with Kyprolis (carfilzomib) and granted Amgen an exclusive product-specific license under our patent rights with respect to Captisol. Kyprolis is formulated with Ligand’s Captisol technology and is approved for the following:
•
In combination with dexamethasone, lenalidomide plus dexamethasone, daratumumab plus dexamethasone, or daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj and dexamethasone, or isatuximab and dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three lines of therapy.
•
As a single agent for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one or more lines of therapy.
Our agreement with Amgen may be terminated by either party in the event of material breach or bankruptcy, or unilaterally by Amgen with prior written notice, subject to certain surviving obligations. Absent early termination, the agreement will terminate upon expiration of the obligation to pay royalties. Under this agreement, we are entitled to receive revenue from clinical and commercial Captisol material sales and a 1.5% to 3.0% royalty on annual net sales of Kyprolis. Amgen’s obligation to pay royalties does not expire until four years after the expiration of the last-to-expire patent covering Captisol. Our patents and applications relating to the Captisol component of Kyprolis are not expected to expire until 2033.
Qarziba (Recordati)
We receive royalties on Qarziba (dinutuximab beta) sales through our acquisition of Apeiron, announced in July 2024. Qarziba is a monoclonal antibody that is specifically directed against the carbohydrate moiety of disialoganglioside 2 (GD2), which is overexpressed on neuroblastoma cells. Dinutuximab beta was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2017 for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma in patients aged 12 months and above, who have previously received induction chemotherapy and achieved at least a partial response, followed by myeloablative therapy and stem cell transplantation, as well as patients with history of relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma, with or without residual disease.
Qarziba is commercially available in more than 35 countries. We receive a tiered mid-teen royalty on worldwide sales of Qarziba from Recordati and are entitled to receive over $25 million in potential milestone payments. See “
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note (3), Acquisitions.
”
Filspari (Travere, CSL Vifor, Renalys) 
In early 2012, we licensed the world-wide rights to Filspari (sparsentan) to Travere Therapeutics. In September 2024, Travere received full 
approval from the FDA for 
Filspari
, which was previously under accelerated approval, for the treatment of immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). 
Filspari
 is the first and only dual endothelin and angiotensin II receptor antagonist in development for rare kidney diseases and is the first non-immunosuppressive treatment indicated for IgAN. In February 2024, Travere and its partner CSL Vifor received approval for 
Filspari
 for the treatment of IgAN in Europe. Additionally, Travere has partnered with Renalys Pharma to develop and commercialize 
Filspari
 in Japan and other Asian countries. Renalys completed enrollment in its registrational Phase III clinical trial of sparsentan for IgAN in January 2025.
In February 2025, Travere announced completion of its Type C meeting with the FDA and plans to submit a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) seeking traditional approval of 
Filspari
 for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The sNDA will be based on existing data from the Phase 3 DUPLEX and Phase 2 DUET studies of 
Filspari
 and is expected to be submitted around the end of the first quarter of 2025.
Under our lic
ense agreement with Travere, we are entitled to receive potential milestone payments, as well as a 9% royalty on worldwide sales.
Ohtuvayre (Verona, Nuance)
We acquired a royalty on Verona's Ohtuvayre (ensifentrine) through our acquisition of Vernalis in 2018 and acquired additional rights from Ohtuvayre inventors during the course of 2024 continuing through January 2025, bringing our royalty rate to 3% of global net sales. Ohtuvayre is a first-in-class selective dual inhibitor of the enzymes phosphodiesterase 3 and phosphodiesterase 4 (“PDE3 and PDE4”) that combines bronchodilator and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory effects in one molecule. Ohtuvayre is delivered directly to the lungs through a standard jet nebulizer without the need for high inspiratory flow rates or complex hand-breath coordination. Ohtuvayre was approved by the FDA in June 2024 for the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ("COPD") in adult patients. Ohtuvayre is the first inhaled product with a novel mechanism of action available for the maintenance treatment of COPD in adult patients in more than 20 years. Verona sublicensed the right to develop and commercialize Ohtuvayre in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and mainland China to Nuance Pharma.
Verona is currently conducting Phase 2 trials for indication expansion in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, as well as a fixed-dose combination of ensifentrine + Long-Acting Muscarinic Antagonist (LAMA) for maintenance treatment of COPD. In 
7
September 2024, Nuance Pharma (private), completed enrollment in its pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating Ohtuvayre for the maintenance treatment of COPD in China. Results from the trial are expected in 2025.
Rylaze (Jazz Pharmaceuticals)
In July 2021, Jazz announced the U.S. launch of Rylaze (asparaginase erwinia chrysanthemi (recombinant)-rywn), previously referred to as JZP458. Rylaze, which was approved by the FDA in June 2021, is a recombinant erwinia asparaginase used as a component of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) in adult and pediatric patients one month or older who have developed hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived asparaginase. In September 2023, Jazz announced that the European Commission (EC) had granted marketing authorization for Rylaze, to be marketed as Enrylaze. Jazz began a rolling launch in the second half of 2023.
We are eligible to receive tiered low-single digit royalties based on worldwide net sales of Rylaze, Enrylaze and any products resulting from this collaboration.
Vaxneuvance (Merck)
Vaxneuvance, a 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, also known as V114, was approved in the U.S. in July of 2021 for the prevention of invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 22F, 23F and 33F in adults 18 years of age and older, and subsequently in children 6 weeks through 17 years of age in June of 2022. Vaxneuvance was also approved in Europe in October 2022 for the prevention of invasive disease and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in individuals 18 years and older and in infants, children and adolescents from 6 weeks to less than 18 years of age. Vaxneuvance utilizes CRM197 vaccine carrier protein, which is produced using the patent-protected Pelican Expression Technology platform, which we acquired in October 2020 through our acquisition of Pfenex. We are entitled to low single digit royalties derived from net sales of Vaxneuvance. 
Capvaxive (Merck)
Capvaxive, a 21 valent pneumococcal vaccine, also known as V116, was approved by the FDA in June 2024 for the prevention of invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 3, 6A, 7F, 8, 9N, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15A, 15C, 16F, 17F, 19A, 20A, 22F, 23A, 23B, 24F, 31, 33F, and 35B in adults 18 years of age and older. Capvaxive is the first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine specifically designed for adults, and its 21 covered serotypes account for approximately 85% of cases of invasive pneumococcal disease among individuals 50 and over, including 8 serotypes not covered by any currently approved vaccines. Following the FDA approval, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (“ACIP”) voted to update the adult age-based pneumococcal vaccination guidelines to recommend Capvaxive for pneumococcal vaccination in adults 50 years of age and older. Additionally, ACIP issued a shared clinical decision-making recommendation for a supplemental dose of Capvaxive for adults 65 years of age and older who have completed their vaccine series with both PCV13 (pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine) and PPSV23 (pneumococcal 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine).

Capvaxive utilizes CRM197 vaccine carrier protein, which is produced using the patent-protected Pelican Expression Technology platform, which we acquired in October 2020 through our acquisition of Pfenex. The FDA approval of Capvaxive triggered a $2 million milestone payment to Ligand, and we are entitled to a low single digit royalty on worldwide net sales.
Pneumosil (Serum Institute of India, SII)
SII began commercialization of its 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Pneumosil, which is produced using CRM197 made in the Pelican Expression Technology platform, in the second quarter of 2020. Pneumosil is designed primarily to help fight against pneumococcal pneumonia among children, with an advantage of targeting the most prevalent serotypes of the bacterium causing serious illness in developing countries. Pneumosil achieved WHO Prequalification in December 2019, allowing the product to be procured by United Nations agencies and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and subsequently achieved Indian Marketing Authorization in July 2020, and SII announced commercial launch of the product in India in December 2020. We are entitled to a low-single digit royalty on net product sales of Pneumosil.
Teriparatide Injection Product (PF708) (Alvogen/Adalvo)
We acquired the teriparatide injection product with the acquisition of Pfenex in October 2020. Teriparatide injection is a drug indicated for various uses including the treatment of osteoporosis in certain patients at high risk for fracture. Teriparatide injection was developed using our Pelican Expression Technology and was approved by the FDA in 2019 in accordance with the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, with FORTEO as the reference product. Our commercialization partner, Alvogen, launched the product in June 2020 in the United States. 
Alvogen has exclusively licensed the rights to commercialize and manufacture the teriparatide injection product in the U.S., while Adalvo has the rights to commercialize in the E.U. and other territories outside the U.S.. In accordance with our agreements with Alvogen, we are eligible to receive tiered gross profit sharing of between 25% and 40% of quarterly profits prior 
8
to an “A” therapeutic equivalence designation, which increases to a flat 50% if an “A” rating is achieved. In accordance with our agreements with Adalvo, we may be eligible to receive milestones and may also be eligible to receive up to 60% of gross profit derived from product sales and regional license fees, if approved, depending on geography, cost of goods sold and sublicense fees.
Evomela (Acrotech and CASI)
We supply Captisol to, and receive royalties from, Acrotech Biopharma for sales of Evomela in the United States, and CASI Pharmaceuticals for sales in China. Evomela is a Captisol-enabled melphalan IV formulation which is approved by the FDA for use in two indications:
•
a high-dose conditioning treatment prior to autologous stem cell transplantation (“ASCT”) in patients with multiple myeloma; and 
•
for the palliative treatment of patients with multiple myeloma for whom oral therapy is not appropriate.
Under the terms of the license agreement, Acrotech Biopharma has marketing rights worldwide excluding China, and CASI Pharmaceuticals has rights to market in China. We are eligible to a 20% royalty on global net sales of the Captisol-enabled melphalan product and revenue from Captisol material sales. Acrotech and CASI’s obligation to pay royalties will expire at the end of the life of the relevant patents or when a competing product is launched, whichever is earlier, but in no event less than ten years from commercial launch. Our patents and applications relating to the Captisol component of melphalan are not expected to expire until 2033. As described herein, we have entered into a settlement agreement with Teva and Acrotech Biopharma (the holder of the NDA for Evomela) which will allow Teva to market a generic version of Evomela in the United States in 2026, or earlier under certain circumstances. Absent early termination, the agreement will terminate upon expiration of the obligation to pay royalties. In December 2024, Acrotech issued a termination process letter to CASI alleging the Company materially breached the license agreement and failed to cure such breach, thus terminating the license agreement. CASI can continue to distribute Evomela in China for a reasonable wind down period not to exceed 24 months.
Nexterone (Baxter)
We have a license agreement with Baxter, related to Nexterone, a Captisol-enabled formulation of amiodarone, which is marketed in the United States and Canada. We supply Captisol to Baxter for use in accordance with the terms of a license agreement and a separate supply agreement between us and Baxter. Under the terms of the license agreement, we will continue to earn milestone payments, a low single digit royalty, and revenue from Captisol material sales. We will earn royalties on net sales of Nexterone through early 2033.
Tzield (Sanofi)
We acquired a royalty of less than 1% on net sales of Tzield through our acquisition of Tolerance Therapeutics (“Tolerance”) in the fourth quarter of 2023. Tzield is the first disease-modifying therapy to be approved in type 1 diabetes (“T1D”). It is a CD3-directed antibody indicated to delay the onset of Stage 3 T1D in adults and children aged 8 years and older with Stage 2 T1D. Tzield was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation in 2019 and was approved by the FDA in November 2022. Tzield is marketed by Sanofi, following its acquisition of Provention Bio, Inc., the developer of Tzield, in 2023 for $2.9 billion. Sanofi also announced data from Tzield’s PROTECT Phase 3 trial, which showed Tzield’s potential to slow the progression of Stage 3 T1D in newly diagnosed children and adolescents. Tzield met the study’s primary endpoint, significantly slowing the decline of C-peptide levels, compared to placebo. Sanofi recently announced they have filed for Tzield's approval in Europe and China, expecting responses in the second half of 2025. Under our agreement with Tolerance, we are entitled to receive royalties through December 1, 2032.

Veklury (Gilead)
We supply Captisol to Gilead for sales of Veklury (remdesivir). Gilead received marketing approval from the FDA in October 2020. Veklury is an antiviral treatment for COVID-19. The product has regulatory approvals for the treatment of moderate or severe COVID-19 in over 70 countries. We are supplying Captisol to Gilead under a 10-year supply agreement. We are also supplying Captisol to Gilead’s voluntary licensing generic partners who are manufacturing remdesivir for 127 low- and middle-income countries. We receive our commercial compensation for this program through the sale of Captisol.
Botensilimab and Balstilimab (BOT/BAL) (Agenus)
In May 2024, we entered into the Agenus Agreement to support BOT/BAL clinical development, confirmatory Phase 3 trial, and launch readiness activities. Botensilimab is an investigational multifunctional anti-CTLA-4 immune activator (antibody) designed to boost both innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune responses. Its novel design leverages mechanisms of action to extend immunotherapy benefits to “cold” tumors which generally respond poorly to standard of care or are refractory to conventional PD-1/CTLA-4 therapies and investigational therapies. Botensilimab augments immune responses across a wide range of tumor types by priming and activating T cells, downregulating intratumoral regulatory T cells, activating myeloid cells and inducing long-term memory responses. Over 900 patients have been treated with botensilimab in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials. Botensilimab alone, or in combination with Agenus’ investigational PD-1 antibody, balstilimab, has shown clinical responses across nine metastatic, late-line cancers. Ligand is entitled to a 2.625% synthetic royalty on future global net sales generated by BOT/BAL pursuant to the Agenus Agreement. This rate may be adjusted depending on future events. 
UGN-301
Additionally, under the terms of the Agenus Agreement, we are eligible for a tiered royalty of 2.625% to 3.75% on future net sales and 31.875% of the future milestone payments made by UroGen to Agenus related to UGN-301. The royalties and milestone payments owed to us could be adjusted up or down based upon predetermined future events and achievements of certain milestones. UGN-301 is an anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody (zalifrelimab), prepared with reverse-thermal hydrogel for intravesical administration into the bladder. Intravesical administration of UGN-301 is designed to increase drug concentrations in the bladder without significant systemic exposure, potentially diminishing the systemic toxicity associated with CTLA-4 blockade. UroGen is evaluating UGN-301 as a monotherapy and as combination therapy for the intravesical treatment of high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.
TR-Beta - VK2809 and VK0214 (Viking) 
Our partner, Viking, is developing VK2809, a novel selective thyroid hormone receptor beta (TR-beta) agonist with potential in multiple indications, including hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemia and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH; also referred to as metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis, MASH). Viking completed a Phase 2b clinical trial (the VOYAGE study) in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH. At the 52-week mark, the drug reduced liver fat content by an average of 37% to 55% compared to baseline, with all treatment arms showing statistically significant improvements compared to placebo.
VK0214, another novel, orally available, TR-beta agonist, is in development for the potential treatment of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (“X-ALD”). VK0214 has been evaluated in a Phase 1b clinical trial in patients with the adrenomyeloneuropathy (“AMN”) form of X-ALD. 
10
Under the terms of the agreement with Viking, we may be entitled to up to $375 million of development, regulatory and commercial milestones and a tiered royalty of 3.5% to 7.5% on potential future net sales of VK-2809 and VK-0214. Our TR-beta programs partnered with Viking are subject to CVR sharing, and a portion of the cash received will be paid out to CVR holders.
Ciforadenant – CPI-444 (Corvus)
Our partner, Corvus, is conducting a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating ciforadenant as a potential first line therapy for metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC) in combination with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1). The Phase 1b/2 study is being conducted by the Kidney Cancer Research Consortium (KCRC) and is led by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Under the terms of our agreement with Corvus, we are entitled to development and regulatory milestones and tiered royalties on potential future sales. Under the terms of our agreement with Corvus, we are entitled to milestones and tiered royalties ranging from mid-single digit to low-teens on potential future net sales.
Qtorin rapamycin (Palvella)
We acquired economic rights to Qtorin™ 3.9% rapamycin anhydrous gel (Qtorin rapamycin, formerly PTX-022) from Palvella in December 2018. Qtorin rapamycin is a novel, topical formulation of high-strength rapamycin currently in development for the treatment of Microcystic Lymphatic Malformations (“Microcystic LM”) and cutaneous venous malformations (“VMs”). The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation, Fast Track Designation, and Orphan Designation to Qtorin rapamycin for the treatment of Microcystic LM. Microcystic LM is a chronically debilitating and lifelong genetic disease affecting an estimated more than 30,000 patients in the U.S. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for Microcystic LM. Palvella is currently conducting a Phase 3 trial evaluating Qtorin rapamycin for the treatment of Microcystic LM and a Phase 2 trial evaluating Qtorin rapamycin for the treatment of cutaneous VMs. Under the terms of our agreement with Palvella, we are entitled to milestones and a tiered royalty of 8.0% to 9.8%. 
Lasofoxifene (Sermonix) 
 Our partner, Sermonix has a license for the development of oral lasofoxifene, its lead investigational drug, for the United States and additional territories. Lasofoxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator in development for the treatment of breast cancer, discovered through the research collaboration between Pfizer and Ligand. Sermonix is currently conducting the Phase 3 ELAINE-3 clinical trial to assess the efficacy of lasofoxifene in combination with Eli Lilly and Company’s CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib (Verzenio
®
) compared to fulvestrant and abemaciclib in pre- and post-menopausal subjects with locally advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer with an ESR1 mutation. In January 2024, Sermonix entered into a strategic collaboration and exclusive license agreement with Henlius for the rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize lasofoxifene in China. Henlius is currently conducting a Phase 3 ELAINE-3 multi-regional clinical trial in China.
Under the terms of our agreement with Sermonix, we are entitled to receive potential regulatory and commercial milestone payments, as well as a tiered royalty of 6% to 10% on potential future net sales. 
Xinshumu (pradefovir) (Xi'an Xintong)
Xi'an Xintong received marketing approval from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for Xinshumu (pradefovir mesylate tablets) in October 2024. Xinshumu is the first liver-targeted, novel Hepatitis B drug developed based on the HepDirect™ liver-targeting prodrug technology that utilizes a chemically modified prodrug of the active compound which is stable in blood and intestines and is activated by a liver specific CYP subtype enzyme to achieve high liver concentration of the active drug and low systemic exposure, reducing side effects in other organs for improved safety. Under the terms of our agreement with Xi'an Xintong, we are entitled to an annual licensing maintenance fee, milestones and a 9% royalty on potential future sales.
MB07133 (Xi'an Xintong)
Xi'an Xintong is also developing MB07133, a liver specific, HepDirect prodrug of cytarabine monophosphate, for the potential treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. MB07133 is currently in Phase 2 in China. We are entitled to an annual licensing maintenance fee and a 6% royalty on potential future sales.

Manufacturing
We contract with a third-party manufacturer, Hovione, for Captisol production. Hovione operates FDA-inspected sites in the United States, Macau, Ireland and Portugal. Manufacturing operations for Captisol are performed primarily at Hovione's Portugal and Ireland facilities. We believe we maintain adequate inventory of Captisol to meet our current partner needs and that our Captisol capacity will be sufficient to meet future partner needs.
In the event of a Captisol supply interruption, we are permitted to designate and, with Hovione’s assistance, qualify one or more alternate suppliers. If the supply interruption continues beyond a designated period, we may terminate our agreement with Hovione. In addition, if Hovione cannot supply our requirements of Captisol due to an uncured force majeure event, we may also obtain Captisol from a third party and have previously identified such parties.
The original term of the agreement was through December 2024 and has been automatically renewed through December 2026. The agreement automatically renews for successive two-year renewal terms. Either party can give written notice of its intention to terminate the agreement no less than two years prior to the expiration of renewal term. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach or bankruptcy of the other party or an extended force majeure event. We may terminate the agreement for extended supply interruption, regulatory action related to Captisol or other specified events. We have ongoing minimum purchase commitments under our agreement with Hovione.
Competition
Some of the drugs we and our licensees and partners are developing may compete with existing therapies or other drugs in development by other companies. Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competing products or technologies and may establish collaborative arrangements with our competitors.
Our Captisol business may face competition from other suppliers of similar cyclodextrin excipients or other technologies that are aimed to increase solubility or stability of APIs. 
Our competitive position also depends upon our ability to obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes. For a discussion of the risks associated with competition, see below under
