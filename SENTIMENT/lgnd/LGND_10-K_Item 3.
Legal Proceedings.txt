Item 3.
Legal Proceedings
On October 31, 2019, we received three civil complaints filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio on behalf of several Indian tribes. The Northern District of Ohio is the Court that the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation (“JPML”) has assigned more than one thousand civil cases which have been designated as a Multi-District Litigation (“MDL”) and captioned In Re: National Prescription Opiate Litigation. The allegations in these complaints focus on the activities of defendants other than the Company and no individualized factual allegations have been advanced against us in any of the three complaints. We reject all claims raised in the complaints and intend to vigorously defend these matters.
On August 22, 2024, CyDex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed a Verified Complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Bexson Biomedical, Inc. (“Bexson”), asserting claims for declaratory relief and breach of contract arising out of a Captisol In Vivo Agreement (the “In Vivo Agreement”) between the parties, pursuant to which CyDex provided Bexson with research-grade Captisol and related confidential and proprietary information for a potential new formulation of ketamine being developed by Bexson. CyDex alleges that Bexson breached its obligations under the In Vivo Agreement, including by misusing confidential information and materials provided by CyDex and by using CyDex’s confidential information and materials to file patent applications that purport to cover formulations that are “not ketamine.” CyDex also asserts that Bexson failed to return and destroy Cydex’s confidential information and materials as required by the Agreement. CyDex seeks relief including specific performance of certain co-ownership provisions of the Agreement and disgorgement from Bexson for any benefits obtained in violation of the In Vivo Agreement. On September 27, 2024, Bexson filed a Motion to Dismiss the Verified Complaint. A Verified Amended Complaint was filed by CyDex on November 6, 2024, and a Motion to Dismiss the Verified Amended Complaint was filed by Bexson on January 17, 2025. 
From time to time, we may also become subject to other legal proceedings or claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We currently believe that none of the claims or actions pending against us is likely to have, individually or in aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Given the unpredictability inherent in litigation, however, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol “LGND.” As of February 25, 2025, there were approximately 320 holders of record of the common stock.
Except for 2007, during which we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $2.50 per share, we have not paid any dividends on our common stock in the past and currently do not expect to pay cash dividends or make any other distributions on common stock in the future. We expect to retain our future earnings, if any, for use in the operation and expansion of our business, to pay down debt and potentially for share repurchases. Any future determination to pay dividends on common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and such other factors as the board deems relevant. 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors in April 2023, which allowed us to acquire up to $50 million of our common stock from time to time through April 2026.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) will help readers understand our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. It is provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.
OmniAb Transactions
On March 23, 2022, we entered into (i) an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “OmniAb Merger Agreement”), among Ligand, OmniAb, Avista Public Acquisition Corp. II, a Cayman Islands exempted company (“APAC”), and Orwell Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of APAC (“Merger Sub”), and (ii) a Separation and Distribution Agreement (the “OmniAb Separation and Distribution Agreement”), among Ligand, OmniAb and APAC. Prior to the effective time of the OmniAb Merger (defined below), APAC migrated to and domesticated as a Delaware corporation (“New OmniAb”) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OmniAb Merger Agreement. Pursuant to the OmniAb Separation and Distribution Agreement, we, prior to the effective time of the OmniAb Merger (i) transferred our then-antibody discovery business (the “OmniAb Business”), including certain of our related subsidiaries, to OmniAb (the “OmniAb Separation”) and (ii) in connection therewith, distributed 100% of OmniAb’s common stock held by Ligand to Ligand stockholders (the “OmniAb Distribution”). We also contributed to OmniAb cash and certain specific assets and liabilities constituting the OmniAb Business. Following the OmniAb Separation and the OmniAb Distribution, on November 1, 2022, in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions of the OmniAb Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into OmniAb, with OmniAb continuing as the surviving company and wholly-owned subsidiary of New OmniAb on and after the effective time of the merger (the “OmniAb Merger”). In addition, New OmniAb changed its corporate name to “OmniAb, Inc.” concurrently upon the effectiveness of the OmniAb Merger.
After the OmniAb Distribution, we do not beneficially own any shares of common stock in OmniAb and no longer consolidate OmniAb into our financial results for periods ending after October 31, 2022. As a result, OmniAb's historical financial results through the OmniAb Separation are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations.
Our MD&A is organized as follows:
•
