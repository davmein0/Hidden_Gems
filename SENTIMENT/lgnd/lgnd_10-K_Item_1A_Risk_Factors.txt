Gain on Sale of Pelican
The gain on sale of Pelican in the amount of $2.1 million for 2023 represents the excess of the fair value of 1) our investment in Primrose Bio and other economic rights; 2) the carrying amount of Pelican business assets and liabilities together with allocated goodwill as of September 18, 2023, the date of sale; and 3) $15 million consideration paid.

The increase in the gain (loss) from short-term investments of $28.7 million is primarily driven by the realized gain of $60.0 million from the sale of 0.7 million shares of Viking common stock in 2024, compared to the $44.4 million realized gain from the sales of 5.0 million shares of Viking common shares in 2023. In addition, the increase was driven by changes in the fair value of our ownership in Viking common stock (an unrealized gain of $9.0 million in 2024 compared to an unrealized gain of $2.6 million in 2023) and a $7.1 million net gain on the arrangements we executed and exercised in 2024 to hedge against the fluctuation in Viking's share price. 
Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our short-term investments and remained relatively steady in 2024 compared to 2023. 
Interest expense in 2024 consists primarily of a royalty and milestone payments purchase agreement, entered by Novan in 2019, and assumed as part of the Novan acquisition in September 2023. Interest expense in 2023 consists primarily of the 0.75% coupon cash interest expense in addition to the non-cash accretion of discount (including the amortization of debt issuance costs) on our 2023 Notes. In May 2023, the 2023 Notes matured, and we paid the remaining $76.9 million principal amount and $0.3 million accrued interest in cash. See additional information in “
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note (10), Debt.
”
50
Other non-operating expense, net, primarily consists of mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives (other than Viking Share Collar and Put and the partner program derivatives) and CVRs and losses on equity method investments. Other non-operating expense, net, increased by $53.2 million in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to the $25.8 million loss from revaluation of Primrose investments, the $12.8 million equity method loss from Primrose Bio, the $12.1 million loss from change in fair value of derivative assets, and the $3.0 million impairment loss related to Neuritek warrants in 2024.

Effective Tax Rate

%
Our effective tax rate for 2024 and 2023 was 260% and 15%, respectively. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as the U.S. federal and state statutory tax rates and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, which we expect to be fairly consistent in the near term. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. In 2024, the variance from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% was primarily attributable to increase in foreign includable income and non-deductible stock based compensation. In 2023, the variance from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% was primarily due the decrease in unrecognized tax benefits. The items below also had an impact on the difference between our statutory U.S. rate.
2024 
•
$5.6 million (224.2%) increase from foreign includable income
•
$3.9 million (155.6%) increase from Section 162(m) limitation
•
$3.2 million (128.3%) decrease from foreign tax credit
•
$1.6 million (65.0%) decrease from valuation allowance

Liquidity and Capital Resources
At December 31, 2024, we had approximately $256.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments decreased by $85.9 million from last year, due to factors described in the “Cash Flow Summary” below. Our primary source of liquidity, other than our holdings of cash, cash equivalents, and investments, has been cash flows from operations. Our ability to generate cash from operations provides us with the financial flexibility we need to meet operating, investing, and financing needs.
Historically, we have liquidated our short-term investments and/or issued debt and equity securities to finance our business needs as a supplement to cash provided by operating activities. Our short-term investments include U.S. government debt securities, investment-grade corporate debt securities, bond funds and certificates of deposit. We have established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities of our investments in order to provide both safety and liquidity. These guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of trends in yields and interest rates. Additionally, we own 
51
certain securities which are classified as short-term investments that we received as a result of a milestone and an upfront license payment as well as 1.0 million shares of common stock in Viking.
On September 30, 2022, we entered into an At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated (the “Agent”), under which we may, from time to time, sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $100 million in “at the market” offerings through the Agent (the “ATM Offering”). The shelf registration statement relating to such shares included a prospectus covering the offering, issuance and sale of up to $100 million of our common stock from time to time through the ATM Offering. The shares to be sold under the Sales Agreement may be issued and sold pursuant to the shelf registration statement. During 2024, we issued 360,325 shares of common stock in the ATM Offering, generating net proceeds of $37.4 million, net of commissions and other transaction costs.
We are obligated to make payments under operating leases, including rental commitments on leases that have not yet commenced. For information on these obligations, see detail in 
“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note (9), Leases.”
We also have commitments under our supply agreement with Hovione for Captisol purchases. The total purchase obligation as of December 31, 2024 was $21.6 million, of which $9.0 million is expected to be paid within a year and the remaining amount is expected to be paid between 1 to 3 years.
In April 2023, our Board approved a stock repurchase program authorizing, but not requiring, the repurchase of up to $50 million of our common stock from time to time through April 2026. We expect to acquire shares, if at all, primarily through open-market transactions in accordance with all applicable requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions will be determined by management based on our evaluation of market conditions, share price, legal requirements and other factors. Authorization to repurchase $50 million of our common stock remained available as of December 31, 2024. See “
Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities
.”
On October 12, 2023, we entered into a $75 million Revolving Credit Facility with Citibank, N.A. as the Administrative Agent. We, our material domestic subsidiaries, as Guarantors (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and the Lenders (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) entered into the Credit Agreement with the Administrative Agent, under which the Lenders, the Swingline Lender and the L/C Issuer (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) agreed to make loans and other financial accommodations to us in an aggregate amount of up to $75 million. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest at a rate equal to either Term SOFR or a specified base rate plus an applicable margin linked to our leverage ratio, ranging from 1.75% to 2.50% per annum for Term SOFR loans and 0.75% to 1.50% per annum for base rate loans. The Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a commitment fee payable on the unused Revolving Credit Facility commitments ranging from 0.30% to 0.45%, depending on our leverage ratio. During the term of the Revolving Credit Facility, we may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to voluntary reductions of the swing line, letter of credit and revolving credit commitments. 
On July 8, 2024, we entered into the first Amendment to the Revolving Credit Facility which amends the Credit Agreement to, among other things, increase the aggregate revolving credit facility amount from $75 million to $125 million.
Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by certain of our collateral and that of the Guarantors. In specified circumstances, additional guarantors are required to be added. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including certain financial maintenance covenants, and events of default applicable to us. In the event of violation of the representations, warranties and covenants made in the Credit Agreement, we may not be able to utilize the Revolving Credit Facility or repayment of amounts owed thereunder could be accelerated. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had $124.4 million in available borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility, after utilizing $0.6 million for letter of credit. The maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility, as amended, is October 12, 2026. As of December 31, 2024, there were no events of default or violation of any covenants under our financing obligations.
We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; continued advancement of research and development efforts; potential stock repurchases; and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and strategic investments. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had $3.7 million in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities associated with the acquisitions to be settled in future periods.

In 2024, we generated cash from operations primarily from revenue and other operating income. We used cash for investing activities primarily for the Apeiron Acquisition and Agenus Transaction. During the year, we generated cash from financing activities, primarily including net proceeds from the sales of shares of common stock in the ATM Offering, and net proceeds from stock options exercises and ESPP.
In 2023, we generated cash from operations primarily from revenue and other operating income. We used cash for investing activities primarily for the purchases of financial royalty assets, the Novan acquisition and our investment in Primrose Bio, partially offset by cash from the sale and maturity of short-term investments including Viking shares. During the year, we used cash for financing activities, including the repayment of the remaining $76.9 million principal amount upon maturity of the 2023 Notes and $0.3 million accrued interest in cash.
In 2022, we generated cash from operations primarily from revenue and other operating income. We generated cash from investing activities primarily from the sale and maturity of short-term investments. During the year, we used cash for financing activities, including the payments related to the extinguishment of certain 2023 Notes.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see “
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note (1), Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.
Impairment Assessment of Finite-lived Intangibles
We regularly perform reviews to determine if an event occurred that may indicate the carrying values of our intangible assets are impaired. If indicators of impairment exist, we assess the recoverability of the affected long-lived assets by comparing its carrying amounts to its undiscounted cash flows. If the affected assets are not recoverable, we estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. Factors that may indicate potential impairment include a significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization compared to net book value, significant changes in the ability of an asset to generate positive cash flows and the pattern of utilization of a particular asset.
In order to estimate the fair value of identifiable intangible assets, we estimate the present value of future cash flows from those assets. The key assumptions that we use in our discounted cash flow model are the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the asset over an extended period of time and a rate of return that considers the relative risk of achieving the cash flows, the time value of money, and other factors that a willing market participant would consider. Significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows and the relative risk of achieving those cash flows. 
Assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external factors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts. For example, if our future operating results do not meet current forecasts or if we experience a sustained decline in our market capitalization that is determined to be indicative of a reduction in fair value of our reporting unit, we may be required to record future impairment charges for purchased intangible assets. Impairment charges could materially decrease our future net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet.
Financial Royalty Assets - Recognition of Income
53
Financial royalty assets represent a portfolio of future milestone and royalty payment rights acquired that are passive in nature (i.e., we do not own the intellectual property or have the right to commercialize the underlying products).
Our financial royalty assets are classified similar to loans receivable and are measured at amortized cost using the prospective effective interest method described in ASC 835-30 
Imputation of Interest
. The effective interest rate is calculated by forecasting the expected cash flows to be received over the life of the asset relative to the initial invested amount. The effective interest rate is recalculated in each reporting period as the difference between expected cash flows and actual cash flows are realized and as there are changes to expected future cash flows.
The gross carrying value of a financial royalty asset is made up of the opening balance, or net purchase price for a new financial royalty asset, which is increased by accrued interest income (except for assets under the non-accrual method) and decreased by cash receipts in the period to arrive at the ending balance.
We recognize income from financial royalty assets when there is a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected. Income is calculated by multiplying the carrying value of the financial royalty asset by the periodic effective interest rate. We account for financial royalty assets related to developmental pipeline or recently commercialized products on a non-accrual basis. Developmental pipeline products are non-commercialized, non-approved products that require FDA or other regulatory approval, and thus have uncertain cash flows. Newly commercialized products typically do not have an established reliable sales pattern, and thus have uncertain cash flows.
Valuation of Partnered Programs Derivative Assets Acquired in Agenus Transaction
Partnered Programs acquired in the transaction with Agenus are accounted for as derivative assets under ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, and were recorded at fair value at acquisition. These derivative assets are marked to fair value at each subsequent reporting period. To determine the fair value of the derivative assets, the Company applied a discounted cash flow model using observable and unobservable market data for inputs, including the estimated amount and timing of the expected cash flows and the probability of success of underlying clinical programs which considers the level of risk appropriate for a respective program stage.

Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risk from interest rates and equity prices which could affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities.
Investment Portfolio Risk
At December 31, 2024, our investment portfolio included investments in available-for-sale securities of $183.9 million, including the investment in Viking common stock of $40.2 million. These securities are subject to market risk and may decline in value based on market conditions.
Credit Risk
We are exposed to credit risk through our counterparties, including risks associated with royalty assets, receivables, and financial instruments such as derivatives and available-for-sale debt securities. Most of our royalty assets and receivables come from contractual agreements that generate royalties based on sales of pharmaceutical products across the United States, Europe, and other regions. This risk is primarily mitigated by the broad range of marketers responsible for paying royalties and the geographic diversity of product sales. Our royalty portfolio includes products marketed by leading biopharmaceutical companies such as Amgen, Merck, Jazz, Recordati, and Sanofi. As of December 31, 2024, Recordati was the largest individual marketer and payor of our financial royalty assets, representing 54% of these assets.
We actively monitor the financial performance and creditworthiness of counterparties to our royalty agreements, derivative financial instruments, and available-for-sale debt securities to assess and respond to changes in their credit profiles. So far, we have not incurred any significant losses related to the collection of income or revenue from royalty assets, available-for-sale debt securities, or the settlement of derivative financial instruments. However, if a counterparty faces bankruptcy or financial difficulties and fails to meet its obligations under a derivative financial instrument, we could face substantial difficulties or delays in recovering amounts owed during bankruptcy or reorganization.
54
Foreign Currency Risk
Through our licensing and business operations, we are exposed to foreign currency risk. Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and from foreign denominated revenues and profit translated into U.S. dollars. As a result, our revenues from royalty payments are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These currency fluctuations could cause our operating results to differ materially from expectations, potentially leading to substantial gains or losses from the remeasurement of company balances. While historically     we have primarily transacted with customers and vendors in U.S. dollars, as our international operations expand, our exposure to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates increase. We expect to continue to expand the number of transactions with our customers that are denominated in foreign currencies in the future. 
We purchase Captisol from Hovione, located in Lisbon, Portugal and Cork, Ireland. Payments to Hovione are denominated and paid in U.S. dollars; however, the unit price of Captisol contains an adjustment factor which is based on the sharing of foreign currency risk between the two parties. Currently, we do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
Also, we generate Qarziba royalty revenue and incur operating expenses at our non-U.S. locations in the local currency for such locations. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could result in an increase to the U.S. dollar equivalent of related income and expenses. These fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect the reported value of foreign-denominated revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities when translated into U.S. dollars.
Interest Rate Risk
We are exposed to changes in interest rates related primarily to our investment portfolio. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. We use a combination of internal and external management to execute our investment strategy. We typically invest in highly rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the risk of principal loss. Our investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We have historically maintained a relatively short average maturity for our investment portfolio, and we believe a hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates across all maturities would not materially impact the fair market value of the portfolio in either period.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Impairment assessment of finite-lived intangibles 
Description of the Matter
At December 31, 2024, the Company’s finite-lived intangible assets totaled $266.6 million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  The Company did not identify indicators of impairment for its finite-lived intangibles at December 31, 2024. 
Auditing management’s assessment of impairment is challenging due to the degree of subjective auditor judgment necessary in evaluating management’s process to identify potential indicators of impairment and the related assessment of the severity of such indicators in determining whether a triggering event has occurred. A high degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate potential triggering events which included market conditions, industry and economic trends, changes in regulations, clinical success and historical and forecasted financial results. The evaluation of triggering events could have a significant effect on the Company’s impairment assessment and the determination of whether further quantitative analysis of finite-lived intangible assets was required.
57
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding of management’s process to identify indicators of impairment, including the qualitative analysis and related inputs and assumptions used in performing the analyses. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls that address the identification of indicators of impairment. For example, we tested controls over management’s assessment of indicators of impairment. 
To test the Company’s evaluation of indicators of impairment for finite-lived intangibles, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the methodologies and testing the completeness and accuracy of the Company’s analysis of events or changes in circumstances. As part of our evaluation, we considered market conditions, industry and economic trends, changes in regulations, clinical success and historical and forecasted financial results, in assessing whether an indicator of impairments exists.
Financial royalty assets - recognition of income
Description of the Matter
As disclosed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s total financial royalty assets, net, were $195.0 million as of December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized income from financial royalty assets of $13.4 million. As explained in Note 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s financial royalty assets are measured at amortized cost and income is recognized using the prospective effective interest method. 
Auditing management’s recognition of income under the effective interest method involved complex auditor judgment, as the assumptions used to forecast the prospective interest rate include estimates of expected future cash flows from the underlying royalties and are therefore affected by uncertainties such as future demand for the underlying product.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls related to the recognition of income on financial royalty assets. This included testing controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in estimating the forecasted cash flows. 
To test the income recognized, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the data used to develop the key assumption identified above. For example, we tested the inputs to the model, principally comprising of historic product sales and estimates of nearer-term sales.  We also evaluated management’s expected future cash flows for the products underlying the royalties and performed a sensitivity analysis over the resulting forecasted product sales. 
58
Valuation of Agenus partnered programs in Agenus acquisition
Description of the Matter
As disclosed in Note 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded $
21.3
 million of non-current derivative assets in acquired rights from future milestone and royalty payments (“Agenus partnered programs”) in the Agenus acquisition.  As of December 31, 2024, total non-current derivative assets in the Agenus partnered programs were $6.3 million and unrealized losses from derivative instruments were $15.0 million. To determine the fair value of the derivative assets, the Company applied a discounted cash flow model using observable and unobservable market data for inputs, including the probability of technical and regulatory success of underlying clinical programs. 
Auditing management’s estimate of the fair value of the derivative assets involved complex auditor judgment because the fair value calculations were sensitive to changes in assumptions described above, and certain inputs used in the determination of the fair value were based on unobservable data, including the probability of technical and regulatory success of underlying clinical programs.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls related to the valuation of derivative assets. This included testing controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions and other inputs used in the valuation models.  
Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodology used in the valuation models and the significant assumptions described above. We compared the significant assumptions to published data for clinical trials. We involved our valuation specialists to assist in the evaluation including assessing whether the methodology used in developing the estimate was consistent with valuation practice given the characteristics of the derivative and to develop an independent value of the assets.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this report to “Ligand,” “we,” “us,” the “Company,” and “our” refer to Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries.
1. 
Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Business
We are a biopharmaceutical company enabling scientific advancement through supporting the clinical development of high-value medicines. We do this by providing financing, licensing our technologies or both.
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the accounts of our parent company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Segment Information
The Company has 
one
 operating and 
one
 reportable segment: development and licensing of biopharmaceutical assets. The Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is Todd Davis, our Chief Executive Officer. The CODM uses net income (loss) from continuing operations as a single segment profit or loss measure to evaluate our single segment performance, and in deciding whether to reinvest into the existing assets, or to new potential opportunities. Our CODM relies on internal management reporting processes that provide information on segment operating income (loss) for making financial decisions and allocating resources. CODM does not evaluate, manage or measure performance of segments using asset information.
The information on significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM, and other segment items included within the reported segment profit or loss measure, is presented in a table below:

56.7
 million, $
48.7
 million, and $
42.0
 million (net of share-based compensation and depreciation expenses), respectively, and additional income and expense items that are presented in consolidated statements of operations such as financial royalty assets impairment, Fair value adjustments to partner program derivatives, cost of Captisol and other non-operating income and expenses.
Reclassification
Certain reclassifications have been made to the previously issued audited consolidated financial statements to conform with the current period presentation. Specifically, within the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, our commercial license and other economic rights line has been reclassified to long-term portion of financial royalty assets, net, and to other assets, and a portion of other investments has been reclassified from other assets. Moreover, noncurrent derivative assets as of December 31, 2023, have been reclassified from other assets.
In addition, within the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, royalties have been reclassified to revenue from intangible royalty assets, and a portion of the contract revenue has been reclassified to income from financial royalty assets.
66
Discontinued operations
The Company determined that the spin-off of the OmniAb Business in November 2022 in connection with the OmniAb Transactions met the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation in accordance with ASC Subtopic 205-20, 
Discontinued Operations
 (“ASC 205-20”).
 For additional information, see 
“Note (5), Spin-off of OmniAb”
. All disclosures have been adjusted to reflect continuing operations.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Acquisitions
We first determine whether a set of assets acquired constitute a business and should be accounted for as a business combination. If the assets acquired are not a business, we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition. Business combinations are accounted for by using the acquisition method of accounting which requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. We record the excess consideration over the aggregate fair value of tangible and intangible assets, net of liabilities assumed, as goodwill.
Under the acquisition method of accounting, we recognize separately from goodwill the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration and all contractual contingencies, generally at the acquisition date fair value. Contingent purchase consideration to be settled in cash are remeasured to estimated fair value at each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded in statement of operations. Costs that we incur to complete the business combination such as investment banking, legal and other professional fees are not considered part of consideration and we charge them to general and administrative expense as they incurred. 
Should the initial accounting for a business combination be incomplete by the end of a reporting period that falls within the measurement period, we report provisional amounts in our financial statements. During the measurement period, we adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date and we record those adjustments to our financial statements in the period of change, if any.
Under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, if we identify changes to acquired deferred tax asset valuation allowances or liabilities related to uncertain tax positions during the measurement period and they relate to new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, those changes are considered a measurement period adjustment and we record the offset to goodwill. We record all other changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in current period income tax expense.

Concentrations of Business Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and investments. We invest excess cash principally in United States government debt securities, investment grade corporate debt securities, mutual funds and certificates of deposit. We maintain some cash and cash equivalents balances with financial institutions that are in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. We have established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities that maintain safety and liquidity. These guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of trends in yields and interest rates.
Revenue and other income from significant partners, which is defined as 10% or more of our total revenue, was as follows:

We are exposed to credit risk through our counterparties, including risks associated with royalty assets, receivables, and financial instruments such as derivatives and available-for-sale debt securities. Most of our royalty assets and receivables come from contractual agreements that generate royalties based on sales of pharmaceutical products across the United States, Europe, and other regions. This risk is primarily mitigated by the broad range of marketers responsible for paying royalties and the geographic diversity of product sales. Our royalty portfolio includes products marketed by leading biopharmaceutical 
67
companies such as Amgen, Merck, Jazz, Recordati, and Sanofi. As of December 31, 2024, Recordati was the largest individual marketer and payor of our financial royalty assets, representing 
54
% of the financial royalty asset balance.
We actively monitor the financial performance and creditworthiness of counterparties to our royalty agreements, derivative financial instruments, and available-for-sale debt securities to assess and respond to changes in their credit profiles. So far, we have not incurred any significant losses related to the collection of income or revenue from royalty assets, available-for-sale debt securities, or the settlement of derivative financial instruments. However, if a counterparty faces bankruptcy or financial difficulties and fails to meet its obligations under a derivative financial instrument, we could face substantial delays in recovering amounts owed during bankruptcy or reorganization.
We obtain Captisol primarily from two sites related to a single supplier, Hovione. If this supplier were not able to supply the requested amounts of Captisol from each site, and if our safety stocks of material were depleted, we would be unable to continue to derive revenues from the sale of Captisol until we obtained material from an alternative source, which could take a considerable length of time.
Cash Equivalents 
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition. 
Short-term Investments
Short-term investments primarily consist of investments in debt and equity securities. We classify our short-term investments as “available-for-sale”. Such investments are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses on debt securities included in the statements of comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities included the consolidated statements of operations. We determine the cost of investments based on the specific identification method. We determine the realized gains or losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities using the specific identification method and include net realized gains and losses as a component of non-operating income and expenses within the consolidated statements of operations. 
Debt securities consist of certificates of deposit, corporate debt securities, and securities of government-sponsored entities. Debt securities have effective maturities greater than three months and less than thirty-six months from the date of acquisition. Debt securities available-for-sale in an unrealized loss position are assessed for current expected credit losses. We start by assessing whether we intend to sell the security, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through earnings. For debt securities available-for-sale that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, we evaluate whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, we consider the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes in interest rates, and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income or loss, as applicable.
Equity securities consist of bond funds, investments in privately held companies (non-marketable equity securities), and companies that have completed initial public offerings (marketable equity securities). Bond funds are valued at their publicly quoted net asset value (“NAV”) price on the last day of the period. Our non-marketable equity securities without readily determinable market values are initially measured at cost and adjusted to fair value for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment. Our marketable equity securities are measured at fair value. Equity investments are classified as short-term investments, equity method investment in Primrose Bio, or other investments, based on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current operations.

Note (7), Balance Sheet Account Details
.” 
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses 
Our accounts receivable arise primarily from sales on credit to customers. We establish an allowance for credit losses to present the net amount of accounts receivable expected to be collected. The allowance is determined by using the loss-rate method, which requires an estimation of loss rates based upon historical loss experience adjusted for factors that are relevant to determining the expected collectability of accounts receivable. Some of these factors include macroeconomic conditions that correlate with historical loss experience, delinquency trends, aging behavior of receivables and credit and liquidity quality indicators for industry groups, customer classes or individual customers.
 During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we considered the current and expected future economic and market conditions and concluded a decrease of $
0.1
 million, an increase of $
0.2
 million, and a decrease of $
0.3
 million of allowance for credit losses, respectively. 
68
Inventory
Inventory, which consists of finished goods (Captisol), is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We determine cost using the specific identification method. We analyze our inventory levels periodically and write down inventory to net realizable value if it has become obsolete, has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value or is in excess of expected requirements.
 During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded an obsolete inventory charge of $
0.2
 million, $
0.2
 million and $
1.1
 million, respectively. In addition to finished goods, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, inventory included prepayments of $
3.1
 million and $
4.6
 million, respectively, to our supplier for Captisol.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost, subject to review for impairment, and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which generally range from 
one
 to 
nine years
, using the straight-line method. Amortization of leasehold improvements is recorded over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the related asset. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. When assets are sold, or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in operating income or expense.

Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

Goodwill, which has an indefinite useful life, represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs indicating the potential for impairment. During the goodwill impairment review, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, including goodwill. The qualitative factors include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and the overall financial performance. If, after assessing the totality of these qualitative factors, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, then no additional assessment is deemed necessary. Otherwise, we proceed to perform the quantitative assessment. We will then evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including the associated goodwill. To determine the fair value, we generally use a combination of market approach based on Ligand and comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of businesses and the income approach based on estimated discounted future cash flows. Our cash flow assumptions consider historical and forecasted revenue, operating costs and other relevant factors. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative assessment in a period and elect to proceed to perform the quantitative assessment for the goodwill impairment test. We performed the annual assessment for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of 2024, noting no impairment. 
Our identifiable intangible assets are typically composed of acquired core technologies, licensed technologies, contractual relationships, customer relationships and trade names. The cost of identifiable intangible assets with finite lives is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the assets’ respective estimated useful lives. We regularly perform reviews to determine if any event has occurred that may indicate that intangible assets with finite useful lives and other long-lived assets are potentially impaired. If indicators of impairment exist, an impairment test is performed to assess the recoverability of the affected assets by determining whether the carrying amount of such assets exceeds the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the affected assets are not recoverable, we estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment loss if the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value. Factors that may indicate potential impairment include market conditions, industry and economic trends, changes in regulations, clinical success, historical and forecasted financial results, market capitalization, significant changes in the ability of a particular asset to generate positive cash flows, and the pattern of utilization of a particular asset.
 We did not identify indicators of impairment for the finite-lived intangibles at December 31, 2024.

Financial Royalty Assets, net (formerly known as Commercial License Rights)
Financial royalty assets represent a portfolio of future milestone and royalty payment rights acquired that are passive in nature (i.e., we do not own the intellectual property or have the right to commercialize the underlying products).
Although a financial royalty asset does not have the contractual terms typical of a loan (such as contractual principal and interest), we account for financial royalty assets under ASC 310, 
Receivables
. Our financial royalty assets are classified similar to loans receivable and are measured at amortized cost using the prospective effective interest method described in ASC 835-30 
Imputation of Interest
.
The effective interest rate is calculated by forecasting the expected cash flows to be received over the life of the asset relative to the initial invested amount. The effective interest rate is recalculated in each reporting period as the difference between expected cash flows and actual cash flows are realized and as there are changes to expected future cash flows.
69
The gross carrying value of a financial royalty asset is made up of the opening balance, or net purchase price for a new financial royalty asset, which is increased by accrued interest income (except for assets under the non-accrual method) and decreased by cash receipts in the period to arrive at the ending balance.
We evaluate financial royalty assets for recoverability on an individual basis by comparing the effective interest rate at each reporting date to that of the prior period. If the total amount of expected undiscounted cash flows is below the amortized cost basis, we measure and record an allowance for the change in expected cash flows. This allowance is measured as the difference between the financial royalty asset’s amortized cost basis and the net present value of the expected future cash flows, calculated using the original effective interest rate. In a subsequent period, if there is an increase in expected future cash flows, or if actual cash flows are greater than cash flows previously expected, we reduce the previously established cumulative allowance in part or in full.
In addition to the above allowance, we recognize an allowance for current expected credit losses under ASC 326, 
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses
 on our financial royalty assets. The credit rating, which is primarily based on publicly available data and updated quarterly, is the primary credit quality indicator used to determine the credit loss provision.
The carrying value of financial royalty assets is presented net of the cumulative allowances for changes in expected future cash flows and expected credit losses. The initial amount and subsequent revisions in allowances for changes in expected future cash flows and expected credit losses are recorded as part of general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.
When we are reasonably certain that a part of a financial royalty asset’s net carrying value (or all of it) is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment which is recorded in financial royalty assets impairment on the consolidated statements of operations. To the extent there was an allowance previously recorded for this asset, the amount of such impairment is written off against the allowance at the time that such a determination is made. Any future recoveries from such impairment are recognized when cash is collected in a respective period earnings.
The current portion of financial royalty assets represents an estimation for current quarter royalty receipts which are collected during the subsequent quarter. This portion is presented in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets, net of the allowance for expected credit losses.

“Note (6), Financial Royalty Assets, net (formerly known as Commercial License Rights)”

Derivative Assets
Derivative assets include instruments used for risk-management purposes, and other instruments. Derivative assets which are not used for risk management purposes, include: (a) acquired rights in future milestone and royalty payments from Agenus Partnered Programs (as defined in 
“Note (2), Agenus Transaction”
), (b) Agenus Warrant (as defined 
“Note (2), Agenus Transaction”
), (c) option to invest up to $
25
 million to milestone and royalty rights which expires on June 30, 2025 (“Upsize Option”), and (d) rights to receive from Primrose Bio 
50
% of milestones on 
two
 contracts previously entered into by Primordial Genetics.
During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we entered into a collar arrangement to hedge against the fluctuation risk in Viking's share price (the “Viking Share Collar”). However, because the Viking stock investment is remeasured at fair value through earnings under ASC 321, the Viking Share Collar is not eligible for hedge accounting, but is considered as an economic hedge. The Viking Share Collar was fully exercised during three month period ending December 31, 2024. During the three months ended December 31, 2024, we entered into a put arrangement to hedge against the fluctuation risk in Viking's share price (the “Viking Share Put”) which expired within the same quarter.
All derivatives are measured at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. For additional information, see 
“Note (8), Fair Value Measurement” and “Note (7), Balance Sheet Account Details”.
Equity Method Investment
Investments that we do not consolidate but in which we have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee are classified as equity method investments and are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
In applying the equity method of accounting, investments are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently adjusted based on our proportionate share of net income or loss of the investee, net of any distributions received from the investee and any impairment.
For additional information, see “
Note (4), Sale of Pelican Business and Investment in Primrose Bio
”.
70
Other Investments
Other investments represent our investments in equity securities of third parties in which we do not have control or significant influence. Our equity securities investments do not have a readily determinable or estimable fair value and are measured using the measurement alternative, which is cost less impairment, if any, and adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. The amount of such impairment or adjustment recognized during the period is presented in other non-operating (expense) income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. For additional information, see “
Note (7), Balance Sheet Account Details
.”

Contingent Liabilities
In connection with the acquisition of CyDex in January 2011, we recorded a contingent liability for amounts potentially due to holders of the CyDex CVRs and former license holders. The liability is periodically assessed based on events and circumstances related to the underlying milestones, royalties and material sales. 
In connection with the acquisition of Metabasis in January 2010, we issued Metabasis stockholders 
four
 tradable CVRs for each Metabasis share. The fair values of the CVRs are remeasured at each reporting date through the term of the related agreement. 
Any change in fair value is recorded in other non-operating (expense) income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. For additional information, see 
“Note (8), Fair Value Measurement”
 and “
Note (7), Balance Sheet Account Details
”.
Revenue and Other Income
Our revenue is generated primarily from royalties on sales of products commercialized by our partners, Captisol material sales, income from financial royalty assets, and contract revenue for license fees, technical, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments. Other operating income is primarily related to milestone income received for financial royalty assets that have been fully amortized or where there is no underlying asset recognized on the consolidated balance sheets. 
We apply the following five-step model in accordance with ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, in order to determine the revenue: (i) identification of the promised goods or services in the contract; (ii) determination of whether the promised goods or services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.
Revenue from Intangible Royalty Assets
We receive royalty revenue from intangible royalty assets on sales by our partners of products covered by patents that we or our partners own under contractual agreements. We do not have future performance obligations under these license arrangements. We generally satisfy our obligation to grant intellectual property rights on the effective date of the contract. However, we apply the royalty recognition constraint required under the guidance for sales-based royalties which requires a royalty to be recorded no sooner than when the underlying sale occurs. Therefore, royalties on sales of products commercialized by our partners are recognized in the quarter the product is sold. Our partners generally report sales information to us on a one quarter lag. Thus, we estimate the expected royalty proceeds based on an analysis of historical experience and interim data provided by our partners including their publicly announced sales. Differences between actual and estimated royalty revenues, which have not been material, are adjusted in the period in which they become known, typically the following quarter.
Income from Financial Royalty Assets
Effective January 1, 2024, we introduced a new line item “income from financial royalty assets”, which was included in “contract revenue” in prior periods. Accordingly, the prior year period amounts have been reclassified to align with the current period presentation.
We recognize income from financial royalty assets when there is a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected. Income is calculated by multiplying the carrying value of the financial royalty asset by the periodic effective interest rate.
We account for financial royalty assets related to developmental pipeline or recently commercialized products on a non-accrual basis. Developmental pipeline products are non-commercialized, non-approved products that require FDA or other regulatory approval, and thus have uncertain cash flows. Newly commercialized products typically do not have an established reliable sales pattern, and thus have uncertain cash flows.
Captisol Sales
Revenue from Captisol sales is recognized when control of Captisol material is transferred or intellectual property license rights are granted to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive from our customers 
71
in exchange for those products or rights. A performance obligation is considered distinct from other obligations in a contract when it provides a benefit to the customer either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer and is separately identified in the contract. For Captisol material or intellectual property license rights, we consider our performance obligation satisfied once we have transferred control of the product or granted the intellectual property rights, meaning the customer has the ability to use and obtain the benefit of the Captisol material or intellectual property license right. We recognize revenue for satisfied performance obligations only when we determine there are no uncertainties regarding payment terms or transfer of control. Sales tax and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. We have elected to recognize the cost of freight and shipping when control over Captisol material has transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of Captisol in our consolidated statements of operations. We expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial. We did not incur any incremental costs of obtaining a contract during the periods reported.
Contract Revenue and Other Income
Our contracts with customers often include variable consideration in the form of contingent milestone payments. We include contingent milestone payments in the estimated transaction price when it is probable a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated results and our best judgment at the time. If the contingent milestone payment is based on sales, we apply the royalty recognition constraint and record revenue when the underlying sale has taken place. Significant judgments must be made in determining the transaction price for our sales of intellectual property. Because of the risk that products in development with our partners will not reach development milestones or receive regulatory approval, we generally recognize any contingent payments that would be due to us upon the development milestone or regulatory approval. 
Some customer contracts are sublicenses which require that we make payments to an upstream licensor related to license fees, milestones and royalties which we receive from customers. In such cases, we evaluate the determination of gross revenue as a principal versus net revenue as an agent reporting based on each individual agreement.
Other income is primarily related to milestone income received for financial royalty assets that have been fully amortized or where there is no underlying asset recognized on the consolidated balance sheets.
Deferred Revenue
Depending on the terms of the arrangement, we may also defer a portion of the consideration received if we have to satisfy a future obligation. The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets), and customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities) on the consolidated balance sheet. Except for royalty revenue and certain service revenue, we generally receive payment at the point we satisfy our obligation or soon after. Therefore, we do not generally carry a contract asset balance. Any fees billed in advance of being earned are recorded as deferred revenue.
 During the year ended December 31, 2024, the amount recognized as revenue that was previously deferred at December 31, 2023 was $
1.3
 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the amount recognized as revenue that was previously deferred at December 31, 2022 was $
0.1
 million.

Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expense consists of labor, material, equipment, and allocated facilities costs of our scientific staff who are working pursuant to our collaborative agreements and other research and development projects. Also included in research and development expenses are third-party costs incurred for our research programs including in-licensing costs, contract research organization (“CRO”) costs and costs incurred by other research and development service vendors. We expense these costs as they are incurred. When we make payments for research and development services prior to the services being rendered, we record those amounts as prepaid assets on our consolidated balance sheet and we expense them as the services are provided.

Share-Based Compensation
We incur share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock, ESPP, and stock options.
Restricted stock unit (“RSU”) and performance stock unit (“PSU”) are all considered restricted stock. The fair value of restricted stock is determined by the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. We recognize share-based compensation expense based on the fair value on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, taking into consideration of forfeitures as they occur. PSU generally represents a right to receive a certain number of shares of common stock based on the achievement of corporate performance goals and continued employment during the vesting period. At each reporting period, we reassess the probability of the achievement of such corporate performance goals and any expense change resulting from an adjustment in the estimated shares to be released are treated as a cumulative catch-up in the period of adjustment. A limited amount of PSUs contain a market condition dependent upon the Company’s relative and absolute total stockholder return over a 
three-year
 period, with a range of 
0
% to 
200
% of the target amount granted to be issued under the award. Share-based compensation expense for these PSUs is measured using the Monte-Carlo simulation valuation model and is not adjusted for the achievement, or lack thereof, of the market conditions.
The Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model is used to estimate the fair value of stock purchases under our ESPP and stock options granted. The model assumptions include expected volatility, term, dividends, and the risk-free interest rate. We look to historical and implied volatility of our stock to determine the expected volatility. The expected term of an award is based on historical forfeiture experience, exercise activity, and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards. The expected dividend yield is determined to be 
0
% given that except for 2007, during which we declared a cash dividend on our common stock of $
2.50
 per share, we have not paid any dividends on our common stock in the past and currently do not expect to pay cash dividends or make any other distributions on common stock in the future. The risk-free interest rate is based upon U.S. Treasury securities with remaining terms similar to the expected term of the share-based awards.
We grant options, RSUs and PSUs to employees and non-employee directors. Non-employee directors are accounted for as employees. Options and RSUs granted to certain non-employee directors typically vest one year from the date of grant. Options granted to employees typically vest 1/8 on the 
six month
 anniversary of the date of grant, and 1/48 each month thereafter for 
forty-two months
. RSUs and PSUs granted to employees vest over 
three years
. All option awards generally expire 
ten years
 from the date of grant.
Share-based compensation expense for awards to employees and non-employee directors is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period until the last tranche vests.

73
Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date. 
Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed to determine the likelihood they will be recovered from future taxable income. A valuation allowance is established when we believe it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of a deferred tax asset will not be achieved. In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence. Factors reviewed include the cumulative pre-tax book income for the past three years, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, history of earnings and reliable forecasting, projections of pre-tax book income over the foreseeable future, and the impact of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies.
We recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Tax authorities regularly examine our returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business and we regularly assess the tax risk of our return filing positions. Due to the complexity of some of the uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability. These differences, as well as any interest and penalties, will be reflected in the provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined.
Income (Loss) Per Share
Basic income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share is computed based on the sum of the weighted average number of common shares and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed based on the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Potentially dilutive common shares consist of shares issuable under the 2023 Notes, stock options and restricted stock. Although we paid off the 2023 Notes in May 2023, it would have a dilutive impact when the average market price of our common stock exceeded the maximum conversion price during the year ended December 31, 2023. It is our intent and policy to settle conversions through combination settlement, which essentially involves payment in cash equal to the principal portion and delivery of shares of common stock for the excess of the conversion value over the principal portion. Potentially dilutive common shares from stock options and restricted stock are determined using the average share price for each period under the treasury stock method. In addition, the following amounts are assumed to be used to repurchase shares: proceeds from exercise of stock options and the average amount of unrecognized compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock. In loss periods, basic net loss per share and diluted net loss per share are identical since the effect of otherwise dilutive potential common shares is anti-dilutive and therefore excluded. For additional information, see 
“Note (11), Stockholders’ Equity”
.
In accordance with ASC 260, 
Earnings per Share
, if a company had a discontinuing operation, the company uses income from continuing operations, adjusted for preferred dividends and similar adjustments, as its control number to determine whether potential common shares a dilutive.

Foreign Currency Translation
The Euro is the functional currency of Apeiron and the corresponding financial statements have been translated into U.S. Dollars in accordance with ASC 830-30, 
Translation of Financial Statements
. Assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates while revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the period in which the activity took 
74
place. Equity is translated at historical rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Comprehensive income (loss) represents net income (loss) adjusted for the change during the periods presented for unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities and foreign currency translation adjustments.

Accounting Standards Updates, Recently Adopted
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. We have adopted the updated accounting guidance in our Annual Report on the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. We have updated our segment disclosure (see 
“Note (1), Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) 
including, among other required items, the information on significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and included within the reported segment profit or loss measure.
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
. The update requires a public business entity to disclose, on an annual basis, a tabular rate reconciliation using both percentages and currency amounts, broken out into specified categories with certain reconciling items further broken out by nature and jurisdiction to the extent those items exceed a specified threshold. In addition, all entities are required to disclose income taxes paid, net of refunds received disaggregated by federal, state/local, and foreign and by jurisdiction if the amount is at least 5% of total income tax payments, net of refunds received. Adoption of the ASU allows for either the prospective or retrospective application of the amendment and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We have not yet completed the assessment of the impact of ASU 2023-09 on our consolidated financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, 
Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income (Subtopic 220-40): Expense Disaggregation Disclosures
. This update requires entities to disaggregate operating expenses into specific categories, such as salaries and wages, depreciation, and amortization, to provide enhanced transparency into the nature and function of expenses. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2024-03 may be applied retrospectively or prospectively. We are currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it may have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
We do not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.
2. 
Agenus Transaction
On May 29, 2024, we closed the transactions pursuant to the $
75
 million purchase and sale agreement (the “Agenus Agreement”), dated May 6, 2024, among us and Agenus Inc., 
Agenus Royalty Fund, LLC, and Agenus Holdings 2024, LLC 
(collectively, “Agenus”). Under the terms of the Agenus Agreement, we received (i) 
18.75
% of the licensed royalties and 
31.875
% of the future licensed milestones paid to Agenus on six-partnered oncology programs, including BMS-986442 (Bristol Myers Squibb), AGEN2373 (Gilead Sciences), INCAGN2385 and INCAGN2390 (Incyte), MK-4830 (Merck), and UGN-301 (UroGen Pharma) (collectively referred as “Agenus Partnered Programs”), and (ii) a synthetic 
2.625
% royalty on future global net sales of Agenus’ novel immuno-oncology botensilimab in combination with balstilimab (“BOT/BAL”) program, collectively subject to certain events which may adjust the royalty and milestone percentages paid to us. In addition, we received the option to commit an additional $
25
 million in the same assets on a pro rata basis which expires on June 30, 2025 (“Upsize Option”). We have also agreed to allow Agenus to raise up to an additional $
100
 million bringing the total syndicated purchase price up to an aggregate of $
200
 million. As part of the Agenus Agreement, Agenus granted us security over certain assets related to the programs included in the Agenus Agreement, subject to certain customary exceptions. 
In connection with entry into the Agenus Agreement, Agenus issued us a 
5-year
 warrant (“Agenus Warrant”) to purchase 
867,052
 shares of its common stock, at an exercise price equal to $
17.30
.
We accounted for all Agenus Partnered Programs, Agenus Warrant and Upsize Option as derivative assets. All derivatives, except for Upsize Option, were presented in noncurrent derivative assets line in our consolidated balance sheets. Agenus Partnered Programs were recognized as derivative assets under ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, as they have different underlyings (milestone payments and royalties). The commercial milestones and royalties are dependent on the development milestones and the commercial milestone and royalties underlyings are not determined to be predominate. The derivative assets were recorded at fair value as of May 29, 2024, and are marked to fair value at each subsequent reporting period. 
75
The fair value of Agenus Partnered Programs derivative assets is determined as a present value of expected future cash flows adjusted for the level of risk appropriate for a respective program stage. As of Agenus Transaction date, it was $
21.3
 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, certain Agenus partners discontinued development of their partnered programs. These programs may be relicensed at a later date, and Ligand would retain its economic interest upon any relicense activity. 
The fair value of Agenus Warrant is determined using a Black-Scholes model. The following assumptions were used as of May 29, 2024, and December 31, 2024, respectively: expected term of 
4.0
 years and 
3.4
 years, volatility of 
84
% and 
102
%, risk-free rate of 
4.7
% and 
4.3
%, Agenus stock price of $
15.03
 and $
2.74
. 
The fair value of the Upsize Option was determined using the binomial option pricing model under which we assessed and considered the possible upwards and downwards scenarios through the expiration date of the Upsize Option. The fair value of the Upsize Option was written down to zero as of December 31, 2024.
For additional information on the Agenus Partnered Program derivative assets, Agenus Warrant, and Upsize Option, see 
“Note (8), Fair Value Measurements”.
We accounted for the acquired BOT/BAL rights as a financial royalty asset which is currently put under the non-accrual method as management cannot reliably estimate future cash flows from this program. The amount of BOT/BAL financial royalty asset was determined as a residual value from the $
75
 million aggregate investment amount, less fair value of all acquired derivative assets as of May 29, 2024. For additional information on the Agenus BOT/BAL rights, see 
“Note (6), Financial Royalty Assets, net (formerly known as Commercial License Rights)”.
3. 
Acquisitions
Apeiron 
On July 15, 2024, we acquired all the outstanding shares of Biologics AG (“Apeiron”), including the royalty rights to Qarziba (dinutuximab beta) for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma (the “Apeiron Acquisition”) for $
100.5
 million base consideration. We funded the Apeiron Acquisition from our available cash on hand. 
In addition to base consideration, we would also pay Apeiron shareholders an additional consideration based on future commercial and regulatory events, including up to $
28
 million if Qarziba royalties exceed certain predetermined thresholds by either 2030 or 2034, and pay additional earn-outs on specific future events, primarily related to Qarziba regulatory approval and commercialization in the USA.
We evaluated this acquisition in accordance with ASC 805, 
Business Combinations
, to discern whether the assets and operations of Apeiron met the definition of a business. We accounted for this transaction as assets acquisition.
We incurred $
4.9
 million of transaction costs related to the Apeiron Acquisition, which were included in the amount of total purchase consideration. All assets acquired (except for contract assets) and liabilities assumed in the Apeiron Acquisition were recognized at their fair values. Contract assets acquired were recognized on a relative fair value basis. 
The amount of purchase consideration was allocated to the acquisition date fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities as follows (in thousands):
Cash and cash equivalents
$
13,437

Contract assets (financial royalty assets)
106,156

Other assets
8,965

Accounts payable and accrued liabilities
(

Income tax payable
(

)
Deferred tax liabilities, net
(
18,109
)
Total fair value of net assets acquired
$
105,433

Contract assets acquired are accounted for as financial royalty assets, similar to loans receivable and are measured at amortized cost using the prospective effective interest method described in ASC 835-30. The acquired contracts assets include Qarziba and other development phase contract assets.
As Qarziba is a commercial phase program, we are able to reasonably estimate future cash flows and, as such, we recognize income from Qarziba financial royalty assets starting from the Apeiron Acquisition effective date, which is calculated by multiplying the carrying value of the financial royalty asset by the periodic effective interest rate. As described in 
“Note (1), Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies”
, the effective interest rate is calculated by forecasting the expected cash flows to be received over the life of the asset relative to the initial invested amount. The effective interest rate is recalculated in each reporting period as the differences between expected cash flows and actual cash flows are realized and as 
76
there are changes to expected future cash flows. We account for other Apeiron development phase financial royalty assets on a non-accrual basis as there is a higher level of uncertainty over the related expected cash flows.
For tax purposes this transaction is treated as a stock purchase. As a result, we will not obtain a tax stepped-up basis in Apeiron’s underlying assets and will assume the carryover tax basis. As part of the tax purchase price accounting, deferred tax liabilities of $
18.1
 million have been recorded to reflect the difference between the book and tax basis of the acquired assets.
We account for the earnout liabilities in the Apeiron Acquisition in accordance with ASC450, 
Contingencies
, and will recognize respective liability when the contingency is resolved, and the liability becomes payable. No earnout liability is recognized as of the acquisition date or as of December 31, 2024.
In conjunction with the Apeiron Acquisition, we have also invested $
4.2
 million (including $
0.2
 million transaction costs) in InvIOs Holding AG (“InvIOs”) common shares, a privately held spin-off of Apeiron. This investment was part of an €
8
 million (approximately $
8.8
 million) round with other investors which would help finance the research and development of three innovative early-stage immuno-oncology assets. Apeiron has previously outlicensed these assets to InvIOs and is entitled to future royalties and milestone payments.
As the result of this investment, we did not obtain control or significant influence in InvIOs. We determined that common stock of InvIOs did not have a readily determinable fair value and therefore elected the measurement alternative in ASC 321 to subsequently record the investment at cost, less any impairments, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. When fair value becomes determinable, from observable price changes in orderly transactions, our investment will be marked to fair value.
Novan
On September 27, 2023, we closed the transaction to acquire certain assets of Novan, Inc. (“Novan”) pursuant to the agreement we entered into with Novan on July 17, 2023 for $
15
 million in cash (which agreement contemplated Novan filing for bankruptcy relief) and provided up to $
15
 million in debtor-in-possession (“DIP”) financing inclusive of a $
3
 million bridge loan funded on the same day. Novan filed for Chapter 11 reorganization on July 17, 2023. On September 27, 2023, the bankruptcy court approved our $
12.2
 million bid to purchase from Novan its lead product candidate berdazimer topical gel, 
10.3
%, all other assets related to the NITRICIL technology platform and the rights to one commercial stage asset. The remaining commercial assets of Novan will be sold to other parties. The approved $
12.2
 million bid was credited to the $
15
 million DIP financing, with the balance of $
2.8
 million and accrued interest repaid to us. 
The acquisition was accounted for as business combination. We recorded $
3.1
 million of acquisition-related costs for legal, due diligence and other costs in connection with the acquisition within operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
We have finalized purchase accounting for the Novan acquisition. The following table sets forth an allocation of the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the excess recorded to goodwill (in thousands):

None
 of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. Acquired intangible assets of $
10.7
 million related to core technology. The fair value of the core technology was based on the discounted cash flow method that estimated the present value of the potential royalties, milestones, and collaboration revenue streams derived from the licensing of the related technologies. These projected cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of 
29
%. The fair value of the core technology is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 
15
 years. 
Acquired other liabilities of $
13.7
 million related to a royalty and milestone payments purchase agreement, entered by Novan in 2019 and assumed as part of the acquisition, which previously provided Novan $
25
 million of funding used primarily in the clinical development of berdazimer topical gel, 
10.3
%. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, Novan will pay ongoing quarterly payments, calculated based on an applicable percentage per product of any upfront fees, milestone payments, royalty payments or equivalent payments received by Novan pursuant to any out-license agreement, net of any upfront fees, milestone payments, royalty payments or equivalent payments paid by Novan to third parties pursuant to any agreements under which Novan has in-licensed intellectual property with respect to such products. If Novan decides to commercialize any product on its own following regulatory approval, as opposed to commercializing through an out-license agreement or other third-party arrangement, Novan will be obligated to pay a low single digits royalty on net sales of such products. This contract liability was fair valued based on the discounted cash flow method that estimated the present value of the potential royalties, milestones, and collaboration revenue streams derived from the related programs mentioned above, by applying a discount rate of 
14
% (revenue risk-adjusted discount rate).
On April 3, 2024, we announced the creation of Pelthos Therapeutics to focus on the commercialization of innovative, safe, and efficacious therapeutic products for patients suffering from conditions with limited treatment options. ZELSUVMI (berdazimer topical gel, 
10.3
%), its first product, is the FDA-approved prescription medicine for the treatment of the highly transmissible molluscum contagiosum (molluscum) viral skin infection in adults and pediatric patients one year of age and older. ZELSUVMI received a Novel Drug designation from the FDA in January 2024 to treat molluscum viral skin infection. ZELSUVMI was developed using Pelthos' proprietary nitric oxide-based NITRICIL technology platform. The rights to ZELSUVMI and all assets related to the NITRICIL technology platform were acquired from Novan in September 2023 in the Novan acquisition described above.
4. 
Sale of Pelican Business and Investment in Primrose Bio
On September 18, 2023, we entered into a merger agreement, pursuant to which our subsidiary, Pelican Technology Holdings, Inc. (“Pelican”) became a wholly owned subsidiary of Primrose Bio. Primrose Bio is a private company focused on synthetic biology. Pelican has developed technology related to PET (protein expression technology) and PelicCRM197 (vaccine material), and has property and equipment, as well as leased property in San Diego, CA. As part of the transaction, we received 
2,146,957
 common shares, 
4,278,293
 preferred shares and 
474,746
 restricted shares of Primrose Bio. Simultaneous with the merger, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Primrose Bio and contributed $
15
 million in exchange for 
50
% of potential development milestones and certain commercial milestones from 
two
 contracts previously entered into by Primordial Genetics. In addition, starting January 1, 2025, we will receive 
25
% of sales revenue of PeliCRM197 above $
3
 million and 
35
% of all PeliCRM197 licensing revenue in perpetuity.
We retained contractual relationships utilizing the Pelican Expression Technology, including the commercial royalty rights to Jazz’s Rylaze, Merck’s Vaxneuvance and V116 vaccines, Alvogen’s Teriparatide, Serum Institute of India’s vaccine programs, including Pneumosil and MenFive vaccines, among others.
We determined that the sale of Pelican meets the definition of a deconsolidation of a business. Net assets sold together with allocated goodwill and cash consideration paid were as follows (in thousands):

$

Goodwill allocated to the selling business based on the relative fair value of the Pelican business and Ligand that was written off was $
4.1
 million, resulting in a $
2.1
 million gain on sale of Pelican recorded to income (loss) from operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Transaction costs of $
1.2
 million were allocated to the equity method investment and equity securities based on the relative fair value.
As described above, we will receive 
25
% of sales revenue of PeliCRM197 above $
3.0
 million and 
35
% of all PeliCRM197 licensing revenue in perpetuity. The considerations were recognized as contingent consideration under the loss recovery model and they will be measured based on the gain contingency model under ASC 450, 
Contingencies
, and thus, will be recognized as the underlying contingencies are resolved.
In addition, we will receive 
50
% of potential development milestones and certain commercial milestones from 
two
 contracts previously entered into by Primordial Genetics. The considerations were recognized as derivative assets with a fair value of $
3.2
 million, at the disposition date, which was included in noncurrent derivative assets in our 
consolidated balance sheets
. They are recognized as derivative assets under ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, as they have two underlyings (development and commercial milestones) and (i) the commercial milestones are dependent on the development milestones and (ii) the commercial milestone underlying is not determined to be predominate. The derivative assets are recorded at fair value as of September 18, 2023, and will be marketed to fair value at each reporting period going forward. During the year ended December 31, 2024, an adjustment of $(
0.1
) million was recorded to market the derivative assets to fair value and was included in fair value adjustments to partner program derivatives in our consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2023, an adjustment of $
0.3
 million was recorded to market the derivative assets to fair value and was included in other non-operating (expense) income, net in our consolidated statement of operations. For additional information, see 
“Note (8), Fair Value Measurement”
 and “
Note (7), Balance Sheet Account Details
”.
Investments in Primrose Bio
We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and to other investments in entities that have risk and reward characteristics that are substantially similar to an investment in the investee’s common stock. Since the preferred stock and restricted share investment in Primrose Bio has a substantive liquidation preference, it is not substantially similar to the common stock investment and is therefore recorded as an equity security under ASC 321, 
Investments - Equity Securities.
We account for our common stock investment in Primrose Bio under the equity method as we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Primrose Bio's operating and financial results. In applying the equity method, we record the investment at fair value. Our proportionate share of net loss of Primrose Bio is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations. Our equity method investment is reviewed for indicators of impairment at each reporting period and is written down to fair value if there is evidence of a loss in value that is other-than-temporary. In June 2024, Primrose Bio received an equity 
79
investment from an equity firm. In July 2024, Primrose Bio raised additional funds from another equity firm. As a result, we recognized an impairment loss on our equity method investment in the amount of $
5.8
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. There was 
no
 impairment to our equity method investment during the year ended December 31, 2023. Our share of the net loss of Primrose Bio for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
7.0
 million and $
1.8
 million, respectively, which reduced Ligand's equity method investment accordingly. Any income or loss from our equity method investment (including the impairment) is presented in other non-operating (expense) income, net in our consolidated statements of operations.
We determined that the Series A preferred stock and reserve stock investments in Primrose Bio did not have a readily determinable fair value and therefore elected the measurement alternative in ASC 321 to subsequently record the investments at cost, less any impairments, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. When fair value becomes determinable, from observable price changes in orderly transactions, our investments will be marked to fair value. Our investments in Series A preferred stock and reserve stock have been reduced by $
25.8
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 in connection with the above mentioned equity funding received by Primrose Bio in June and July 2024. There were no no observable price changes or impairment to our investments in Series A preferred stock and reserve stock during the year ended December 31, 2023. Any income or loss from our investments in Series A preferred stock and reserve stock (including the impairment) is presented in other non-operating (expense) income, net in our consolidated statements of operations.
Former President and Chief Operating Officer Matt Korenberg served as a board member of Primrose Bio beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023. His employment with Ligand concluded in October 2024, after which Lauren Hay, Vice President of Strategic Planning & Investment Analytics, succeeded him as a board member of Primrose Bio. 
5. 
Spin-off of OmniAb
On March 23, 2022, we entered into the OmniAb Separation and Distribution Agreement to separate our OmniAb Business and the OmniAb Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Merger Sub would merge with and into OmniAb, with OmniAb continuing as the surviving corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of New OmniAb following the effectiveness of such merger, resulting in New OmniAb’s acquisition of our OmniAb Business, in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (collectively, the “OmniAb Transactions”). 
After the final closing date of the OmniAb Transactions on November 1, 2022, the historical financial results of OmniAb have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations under GAAP for all periods presented through the date of the OmniAb Distribution. Pursuant to the OmniAb Separation and Distribution Agreement, Ligand contributed to OmniAb cash and certain specific assets and liabilities constituting the OmniAb Business. Pursuant to the OmniAb Distribution, Ligand distributed on a pro rata basis to its stockholders as of October 26, 2022 shares of the common stock of OmniAb representing 
100
% of Ligand’s interest in OmniAb. Immediately following the OmniAb Distribution, Merger Sub merged with and into OmniAb, with OmniAb continuing as the surviving company in the OmniAb Merger and as a wholly owned subsidiary of New OmniAb. The entire transaction was completed on November 1, 2022, and following the OmniAb Merger, New OmniAb is an independent, publicly traded company whose common stock trades on NASDAQ under the symbol “OABI.” After the OmniAb Distribution, we do not beneficially own any shares of common stock in OmniAb and no longer consolidate OmniAb into our financial results for periods ending after November 1, 2022. 
Discontinued operations
In connection with the OmniAb Merger, the Company determined its OmniAb Business qualified for discontinued operations accounting treatment in accordance with ASC 205-20. We recognized a $
1.7
 million tax provision adjustment related to deferred taxes during the year ended December 31, 2023 that was attributable to the discontinued operations.

(1) The amounts of allowance include accumulated allowance for changes in expected cash flows and current expected credit losses.
(2) The amounts include $
10.0
 million current portion of financial royalty assets which represents an estimation for current quarter royalty receipts that are collected during the subsequent quarter. This portion is presented in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.
Financial royalty assets represent a portfolio of future milestone and royalty payment rights acquired in the Apeiron Acquisition in July 2024, from Agenus in May 2024, Selexis, S.A. (“Selexis”) in April 2013 and May 2015, CorMatrix Cardiovascular, Inc. (“CorMatrix”) in May 2016, which was later acquired by Aziyo (Aziyo changed its corporate name to Elutia Inc. (“Elutia”) in September 2023) in 2017, Ovid Therapeutics Inc. (“Ovid”) in October 2023, Tolerance Therapeutics, Inc. (“Tolerance Therapeutics”) in November 2023, and from certain ensifentrine inventors in March and August 2024.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a $
30.3
 million impairment loss for Ovid (Soticlestat) financial royalty asset and a $
0.3
 million impairment loss for Selexis financial royalty asset. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a $
0.9
 million impairment loss for Selexis financial royalty asset as a result of reduced programs.
Apeiron Financial Royalty Assets
As discussed in 
“Note (3), Acquisitions”
, we acquired certain financial royalty assets within the Apeiron Acquisition, including Qarziba and certain InvIOs programs, recorded at $
104.9
 million and $
1.3
 million, respectively as of Apeiron Acquisition date. As Qarziba is a commercial phase program, we are able to reasonably estimate future cash flows and, as such, we recognized income from Qarziba financial royalty assets starting from the Apeiron Acquisition effective date. We accounted for InvIOs financial royalty assets using the non-accrual method until we are able to reliably estimate future cash flows.
Tzield Agreement
In November 2023, we acquired Tolerance Therapeutics for $
20
 million in cash. Tolerance Therapeutics is a holding company, owned by the inventors of Tzield (teplizumab), and is owed a royalty of less than 
1
% on worldwide net sales of Tzield. Tzield is marketed by Sanofi, starting in 2023. For tax purposes this transaction was treated as a stock deal, so there is no step-up in basis and tax attributes. Therefore, during the year ended December 31, 2024, a deferred tax liability (DTL) of $
5.5
 million was recognized on the book basis and tax basis difference and recorded to the book value of the Tolerance Therapeutics’ financial royalty asset. Due to the early stages of Tzield's commercialization, management has placed the investment on the non-accrual method until we are able to reliably estimate future cash flows.
Ensifentrine Inventors Agreements
In March and August 2024, we acquired future milestone and royalty rights related to ensifentrine from certain ensifentrine inventors for a total of $
3.8
 million and $
13.6
 million, respectively. On June 26, 2024, Verona Pharma plc received FDA approval for ensifentrine for the maintenance treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”). During the third quarter of 2024, Verona started commercial sales of ensifentrine (marketed as Ohtuvayre) in the U.S. Due to the early stages of Ohtuvayre's commercialization, management has placed the investment on the non-accrual method until we are able to reliably estimate future cash flows.
Elutia Agreement
In 2016, Ligand entered into a purchase agreement to acquire certain financial royalty assets from CorMatrix. In 2017, CorMatrix sold its marketed products to Elutia where Elutia assumed the Ligand royalty obligation. In 2017, we amended the 
82
terms of the royalty agreement with Elutia where we received $
10
 million to buydown the royalty rates on the products CorMatrix sold to Elutia (the “CorMatrix Asset Sale”). Per the amended agreement with Elutia, we will receive a 
5
% royalty, with certain annual minimum payments, on the products Elutia acquired in the CorMatrix Asset Sale and up to $
10
 million of milestones tied to cumulative net sales of these products. The royalty agreement will terminate on May 31, 2027. 
During 2023, due to Elutia's nonpayment of the minimum payments under the amended royalty agreement over several quarters, we placed the Elutia asset on the non-accrual method. In January 2024, we executed an amendment to our agreement with Elutia which will allow us to reliably estimate future cash flows. As such, the Elutia asset was switched from the non-accrual method to the effective interest method during the first quarter of 2024. We further considered the current and expected future economic and market conditions, current company performance and recent payments received from Elutia. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a reduction of $
5.2
 million and an increase of $
3.2
 million, respectively, to Elutia allowance of expected credit loss. The credit loss adjustments were included in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
Soticlestat Agreement
In October 2023, we made an investment of $
30
 million to acquire a 
13
% portion of the royalties and milestones owed to Ovid Therapeutics related to the potential approval and commercialization of soticlestat. 
In June 2024, Takeda announced topline results of the phase 3 clinical trial of soticlestat, narrowly missing its primary endpoint to reduce convulsive seizure frequency compared to placebo in patients with Dravet syndrome, and missing its primary endpoint to reduce major motor drop seizure frequency compared to a placebo in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In January 2025, Takeda announced its decision to discontinue its soticlestat program. As a result, in the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized a full impairment of the soticlestat financial royalty asset.

Our investment policy is capital preservation and we only invested in U.S.-dollar denominated investments. We held a total of 
45
 securities which were in an unrealized loss position with a total of $
0.03
 million unrealized losses as of December 31, 2024. We believe that we will collect the principal and interest due on our debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses are largely due to changes in interest rates and not to unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities that impacted our assessment on collectability of principal and interest. In July 2024, we sold certain securities before the recovery of the amortized cost basis to fund the Apeiron Acquisition. Accordingly, we wrote down the amortized cost of $
0.05
 million during the second quarter of 2024. We do not intend to sell these securities and it is unlikely that we will be required to sell these securities before the recovery of the amortized cost basis as of December 31, 2024. Accordingly, there was 
no
 credit loss recognized for the year ended December 31, 2024. There was 
no
 credit losses recognized for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
Short-term Investments: Investment in Viking
We held 
1.0
 million shares of Viking common stock as of December 31, 2024, and we account for it as an investment in available-for-sale equity securities, which is measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. 
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our investment in Viking was $
40.2
 million and $
32.2
 million, respectively, and was included in short-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold 
0.7
 million shares of Viking common stock and recognized a total realized gain of $
60.0
 million. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we sold 
5.0
 million shares of Viking common stock and recognized a total realized gain of $
44.4
 million. There were 
no
 sales of Viking common stock during the year ended December 31, 2022.

During the third quarter of 2024, we recognized a full impairment for our investment in Neuritek warrants. 
On December 13, 2024, Palvella Therapeutics, Inc. (“Palvella”) announced the completion of its previously announced merger with Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Pieris”). The combined company will operate under the name Palvella Therapeutics, Inc., and its shares are expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on December 16, 2024, under the ticker symbol “PVLA”. In conjunction with the transaction, the Series C Preferred Shares we held were converted to common shares using an exchange ratio of approximately 
0.3095
, converting the 
189,112
 Series C preferred shares into 
58,524
 common shares. We account for the Palvella common shares as a short-term investment included in our consolidated balance sheet. 
Other Assets and Other Current Assets
Other assets include economic rights related to the 2023 expansion of our strategic partnership with Palvella to accelerate Phase 3 development of Qtorin rapamycin for the treatment of Microcystic Lymphatic Malformations (“Microcystic LM”). According to the terms of the second amendment to our development funding and royalties agreement with Palvella (the “Palvella Second Amendment”), Palvella received an upfront payment of $
5
 million from Ligand. In return for the upfront payment, among other contractual changes, the tiered royalty payable by Palvella to Ligand was increased to between 
8.0
% and 
9.8
% based on annual aggregate worldwide net sales of Qtorin rapamycin. We are not obligated to provide additional funding to Palvella for development or commercialization of Qtorin.
We determined the economic rights related to Palvella should be characterized as a funded research and development arrangement, because the contract designated the funds usage for research and development activities, and thus we account for them in accordance with ASC 730-20, 
Research and Development Arrangement
. We reduce our asset as the funds are expended by Palvella. As of December 31, 2024, of the $
5
 million upfront funding related to the Palvella Second Amendment, $
1.2
 million of the funding to Palvella was expended. Our CEO and director, Todd Davis, is a director of Palvella. Mr. Davis recused himself from both board's consideration of the agreement between us and Palvella, including any financial analysis, the terms of the Palvella Second Amendment and the vote to approve the Palvella Second Amendment and the related transactions.
In June 2024, we funded Palvella $
2.5
 million in exchange for a convertible note with a maturity of 
three years
, which is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. In conjunction with Pavella's merger with Pieris as discussed above, the convertible note automatically converted into Pavella common shares. The $
2.6
 million principal and interest converted into 
184,595
 shares, using a conversion price of $
13.9965
 per share. We account for the Palvella common shares as a short-term investment in our consolidated balance sheet. 
Other current assets primarily include $
10.0
 million current portion of financial royalty assets (disclosed in 
“Note (6), Financial Royalty Assets, net (formerly known as Commercial License Rights)”
), and $
4.5
 million inventory (raw materials and work in process related to the manufacturing of finished goods) for the preparation of commercial supplies of ZELSUVMI by Pelthos Therapeutics, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ligand. For additional information on ZELSUVMI, see

Fair Value Measurement
We measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. We establish a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels are described in the below with level 1 having the highest priority and level 3 having the lowest:
Level 1 - Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets 
Level 2 - Inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly 
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions
87

(1) Excluding our investment in Viking, corporate equity securities, and US government securities, our short-term investments in marketable debt and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale securities based on management's intentions and are at level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, as these investment securities are valued based upon quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Short-term investments in bond funds are valued at their net asset value (NAV) on the last day of the period. We have classified marketable securities with original maturities of greater than one year as short-term investments based upon our ability and intent to use any and all of those marketable securities to satisfy the liquidity needs of our current operations. In addition, we had investment in warrants resulting from Seelos Therapeutics Inc. milestone payments that were settled in shares during the first quarter of 2019 and were at level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, based on Black-Scholes value estimated by management on the last day of the period. This investment in warrants expired in January 2024.
(2) Derivative assets include instruments used for risk-management purposes, and other instruments. Derivative assets which are not used for risk management purposes include: (a) acquired rights in future milestone and royalty payments from Agenus Partnered Programs, (b) Agenus Warrant, (c) Upsize Option, (d) Viking Share Collar (e) and rights to receive from Primrose Bio 
50
% of milestones on 
two
 contracts previously entered into by Primordial Genetics. The considerations were recognized as derivative assets included under current derivative assets and noncurrent derivative assets in our consolidated balance sheet. They are recognized as derivative assets under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The fair value of the Agenus Partnered Programs and the Primrose Bio derivative assets was determined using a discounted cash flow approach, utilizing the mostly-likely cash flows which considered the probability of success for the underlying clinical programs. The discount rate used contemplates the underlying credit and business risk of the partnered programs. At December 31, 2024, the discount rates used range between 
15
% and 
28
%. At December 31, 2023, the discount rate used was 
25
%. The fair value of the Agenus Warrant was determined using a Black-Scholes-Merton model. The fair value of the Upsize Option was determined using a binomial option pricing model.
(3) In connection with our acquisition of Metabasis in January 2010, we issued Metabasis stockholders 
four
 tradable CVRs, 
one
 CVR from each of 
four
 respective series of CVR, for each Metabasis share. The CVRs entitle Metabasis stockholders to cash payments as frequently as every 
six months
 as cash is received by us from proceeds from the sale or partnering of any of the Metabasis drug development programs, among other triggering events. The liability for the CVRs is determined using quoted prices in a market that is not active for the underlying CVR. The carrying amount of the liability may fluctuate 
88
significantly based upon quoted market prices and actual amounts paid under the agreements may be materially different than the carrying amount of the liability. Several of the Metabasis drug development programs have been outlicensed to Viking, including VK2809. VK2809 is a novel selective TR-β agonist with potential in multiple indications, including hypercholesterolemia, dyslipidemia, NASH, and X-ALD. Under the terms of the agreement with Viking, we may be entitled to up to $
375
 million of development, regulatory and commercial milestones and tiered royalties on potential future sales including a $
10
 million payment upon initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial.

Assets Measured on a Non-Recurring Basis
We apply fair value techniques on a non-recurring basis associated with valuing potential impairment losses related to our goodwill, intangible assets with estimated useful lives and long-lived assets.
We evaluate goodwill annually for impairment and whenever circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired. We determine the fair value of our reporting unit based on a combination of inputs, including the market capitalization of Ligand, as well as Level 3 inputs such as discounted cash flows, which are not observable from the market, directly or indirectly.
We evaluate intangible assets with estimated useful lives whenever circumstances occur indicating that intangible assets may not be recoverable. An impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets are largely independent of other groups of assets and liabilities.
There was 
no
 impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets, or long-lived assets recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Other than the finance lease equipment discussed in 
“Note (9), Leases”
, there was 
no
 impairment of our goodwill, intangible assets, or long-lived assets recorded during the year ended and December 31, 2022. 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, financial royalty assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, deferred revenue, current operating lease liabilities, current finance lease liabilities and Novan (Pelthos) other long-term liabilities are financial instruments and are recorded at cost in the consolidated balance sheets. The estimated 
89
fair value of the Novan (Pelthos) other long-term liabilities is $
19.1
 million compared to a carrying value of $
15.9
 million. The estimated fair value of the remaining financial instruments approximates their carrying value.
Financial Assets Not Measured at Fair Value
Financial royalty assets are measured and carried on the balance sheet at amortized cost using the effective interest method or on a non-accrual basis. Management calculates the fair value of financial royalty assets using a forecasted royalty receipts. The projected future cash flows derive from royalty payments and milestones, then discounted using appropriate individual discount rates. The fair value of financial royalty assets and other economic rights assets is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy since it is determined based upon inputs that are both significant and unobservable. The estimated fair value and related carrying values of financial royalty assets as of December 31, 2024 were $
196.6
 million and $
195.0
 million, respectively. The estimated fair value and related carrying value of the financial royalty assets as of December 31, 2023 were $
75.9
 million and $
62.3
 million, respectively. To determine the fair value of long-term financial royalty assets, we estimated future underlying product sales, applied a probability of technical and regulatory success for development stage programs, estimated a timeline for any development and regulatory milestones, and applied a discount rate based on the level of partner execution and commercialization risk, in the range of 
15
-30% and 
10
-
45
% as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.
 Weighted average discount rate (weighted by relative fair value) was 19% and 18% as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.
9. 
Leases
Finance lease
In May 2020 and January 2021, we entered into an agreement and the first amendment with Hovione, our third-party manufacturer, to increase our manufacturing of Captisol, respectively. The agreements are considered to include an embedded finance lease under ASC 842, 
Leases
, as it provides the Company the right to use the underlying equipment to exclusively manufacture Captisol. As of December 31, 2021, we had fully paid consideration of $
69.1
 million for prepaid inventory and capacity ramp-up fee. We allocated consideration in the agreements between lease and non-lease components using relative standalone prices. Since the inception of the agreements, we have allocated $
50.2
 million of the consideration paid to the non-lease component which is accounted for as prepaid inventory and being amortized to cost of Captisol based on the usage. The remaining balance of $
18.9
 million was recognized as a right of use asset. 
As of December 31, 2022, given the COVID status, our forecast for COVID-related Captisol had been significantly reduced, which triggered an indicator of impairment of the right of use asset. We performed a recoverability test at the asset group level by comparing the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset group to its carrying value and identified the asset was impaired. We recorded a $
9.8
 million of impairment charge based on the fair value of the right of use asset which has been recognized in cost of Captisol in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining right of use asset balance was $
4.0
 million which will be amortized straight-line over the remaining 
6
 years lease term. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
no
 impairment to this asset group was recorded as there were no indicators of impairment. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the remaining right of use asset balance is $
2.7
 million and $
3.4
 million, respectively.
Operating lease 
We lease certain office facilities and equipment primarily under various operating leases. Our operating leases have remaining contractual terms up to 
eight years
, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 
five years
. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, material restrictive covenants, or material termination options. Our operating lease costs are primarily related to facility leases for administration offices and research and development facilities.
Lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement of an arrangement where it is determined at inception that a lease exists. Lease assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. These assets and liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term calculated using our incremental borrowing rate generally applicable to the location of the lease asset, unless the implicit rate is readily determinable. Lease assets also include any upfront lease payments made and lease incentives. Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that those options will be exercised.
In addition to base rent, certain of our operating leases require variable payments, such as insurance and common area maintenance. These variable lease costs, other than those dependent upon an index or rate, are expensed when the obligation for those payments is incurred. Leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet, and the expense for these short-term leases and for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
90
The depreciable life of lease assets and leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we entered into lease agreements for our offices located in Boston, Massachusetts, and Jupiter, Florida, which resulted in a $
1.6
 million and $
0.1
 million, respectively, increase in both operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities at lease commencement. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we entered into an amendment to the lease agreement for our office located in San Diego, California, which resulted in a $
1.1
 million increase in both operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities at lease commencement.

Debt
0.75
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023
In May 2018, we issued $
750
 million aggregate principal amount of 2023 Notes, bearing cash interest at a rate of 
0.75
% per year, payable semi-annually. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting the initial purchasers' discount and offering expenses, were approximately $
733.1
 million. 
In connection with the issuance of the 2023 Notes, we incurred $
16.9
 million of issuance costs, which primarily consisted of underwriting, legal and other professional fees and was being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the 
five years
 expected life of the 2023 Notes. On May 15, 2023, the 2023 Notes maturity date, we paid the remaining $
76.9
 million principal amount and $
0.3
 million accrued interest in cash. The effective interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was 
0.5
%. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a total of $
0.6
 million in interest expense, including $
0.4
 million in contractual interest expense and $
0.2
 million in amortized issuance costs. 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased $
266.4
 million in principal amount of the 2023 Notes for $
261.4
 million in cash, including accrued interest of $
0.5
 million We accounted for the repurchase as a debt extinguishment, which resulted in a gain of $
4.2
 million reflected in other non-operating (expense) income, net, in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, and a $
1.3
 million reduction in debt discount. 
Convertible Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions
In conjunction with the 2023 Notes, in May 2018, we entered into convertible bond hedges and sold warrants covering 
3,018,327
 shares of our common stock to minimize the impact of potential dilution to our common stock and/or offset the cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the 2023 Notes. The convertible bond hedges have an exercise price of $
206.65
 per share and are exercisable when and if the 2023 Notes are converted. We paid $
140.3
 million for these convertible bond hedges. If upon conversion of the 2023 Notes, the price of our common stock is above the exercise price of the convertible bond hedges, the counterparties will deliver shares of common stock and/or cash with an aggregate value approximately equal to the difference between the price of common stock at the conversion date and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of shares of common stock related to the convertible bond hedge transaction being exercised. The convertible bond hedges and warrants described below are separate transactions entered into by us and are not part of the terms of the 2023 Notes. Holders of the 2023 Notes and warrants did not have any rights with respect to the convertible bond hedges.
Concurrently with the convertible bond hedge transactions, we entered into warrant transactions whereby we sold warrants covering 
3,018,327
 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $
315.38
 per share, subject to certain adjustments. We received $
90.0
 million for these warrants. The warrants have various expiration dates ranging from August 15, 2023 to February 6, 2024. The warrants will have a dilutive effect to the extent the market price per share of common stock exceeds the applicable exercise price of the warrants, as measured under the terms of the warrant transactions. The common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants will be in unregistered shares, and we do not have the obligation and do not intend to file any registration statement with the SEC registering the issuance of the shares under the warrants.
In August 2022, in connection with the repurchases of $
227.8
 million in principal of the 2023 Notes for $
223.7
 million in cash, including accrued interest of $
0.4
 million made during the six months ended June 30, 2022, we entered into Bond Hedge Unwind Agreements with Barclays Bank PLC, Deutsche Bank AG, and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC to unwind a portion of the convertible note hedges transactions we initially entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2023 Notes. 
As of December 31, 2023, there are no warrants that remain outstanding. The warrants expired on February 6, 2024.
Revolving Credit Facility
On October 12, 2023, we entered into a $
75
 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with Citibank, N.A. as the Administrative Agent (as defined in the Credit Agreement). We, our material domestic subsidiaries, as Guarantors (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and the Lenders (as defined in the Credit Agreement) entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with the Administrative Agent, under which the Lenders, the Swingline Lender and the L/C Issuer (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) agreed to make revolving loans, swingline loans and other financial accommodations to us (including the issuance of letters of credit) in an aggregate amount of up to $
75
 million. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest at a rate equal to either Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”) or a specified base rate plus an applicable margin linked to our leverage ratio, ranging from 
1.75
% to 
2.50
% per annum for Term SOFR loans and 
0.75
% to 
1.50
% per annum for base rate loans. The Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a commitment fee payable on the unused Revolving Credit Facility commitments ranging from 
0.30
% to 
0.45
%, depending on our leverage ratio. During the term of the Revolving Credit Facility, we may borrow, repay and re-borrow amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facility, subject to voluntary reductions of the swing line, letter of credit and revolving credit commitments.
92
Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by certain of our collateral and that of the Guarantors. In specified circumstances, additional guarantors are required to be added to the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including certain financial maintenance covenants, and events of default applicable to us. In the event of violation of the representations, warranties and covenants made in the Credit Agreement, we may not be able to utilize the Revolving Credit Facility or repayment of amounts owed thereunder could be accelerated. 
Amendment to Revolving Credit Facility
On July 8, 2024, we entered into the first amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Credit Agreement, which amends the Credit Agreement to, among other things, increase the aggregate revolving credit facility amount from $
75
 million to $
125
 million.
As of December 31, 2024, we had $
124.4
 million in available borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility, after utilizing $
0.6
 million for letter of credit. As of December 31, 2023, we had $
74.5
 million in available borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility, after utilizing $
0.5
 million for letter of credit. The maturity date of the Revolving Credit Facility, as amended, is October 12, 2026. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no events of default or violation of any covenants under our financing obligations.

Conversion and Modification of Equity Awards Outstanding at Separation Date
In connection with the OmniAb Separation on November 1, 2022, under the provisions of the existing plans, we adjusted our outstanding equity awards in accordance with the OmniAb Merger Agreement to preserve the intrinsic value of the awards immediately before and after the OmniAb Distribution. Upon the OmniAb Distribution, employees holding stock options, restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units denominated in pre-OmniAb Distribution Ligand stock received a number of otherwise-similar awards either in post-OmniAb Distribution Ligand stock or in a combination of post-OmniAb Distribution Ligand stock and OmniAb stock based on conversion ratios outlined for each group of employees in the OmniAb Merger Agreement. The equity awards that were granted prior to March 2, 2022 were converted under the shareholder method, wherein employees holding outstanding equity awards received equity awards in both Ligand and OmniAb. For equity awards granted after March 2, 2022, for Ligand employees, the number of awards that were outstanding at the OmniAb Separation were proportionately adjusted into post-OmniAb Distribution Ligand stock to maintain the aggregate intrinsic value of the awards at the date of the OmniAb Separation; for OmniAb employees, the number of awards that were outstanding at the OmniAb Separation were proportionately adjusted into post-OmniAb Distribution OmniAb stock to maintain the aggregate intrinsic value of the awards at the date of the OmniAb Separation. The conversion ratio was determined based on the relative values of Ligand common stock in the “regular way” and “ex-distribution” markets during the five-trading day period prior to the closing of the business combination.
These modified awards otherwise retained substantially the same terms and conditions, including term and vesting provisions. Additionally, we will not incur any future compensation cost related to equity awards held by OmniAb employees and directors. We will incur future compensation cost related to OmniAb equity awards held by our employees.
Stock Plans
In June 2022, our stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of the Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2002 Plan”). The amended and restated 2002 Plan, which is referred to herein as the “Restated Plan” was amended to increase the shares available for issuance by 
1.0
 million. In June 2024, our stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of the Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 2002 Stock Incentive Plan, which increased the shares available for issuance by 
1.3
 million.
On July 29, 2022, our board of directors (the “Board”) approved the Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 2022 Employment Inducement Plan (the “2022 Inducement Plan”). The terms of the 2022 Inducement Plan are substantially similar 
93
to the terms of the Restated Plan with the exception that incentive stock options may not be issued under the 2022 Inducement Plan and awards under the 2022 Inducement Plan may only be issued to eligible recipients under the applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules. The 2022 Inducement Plan was adopted by the Board without stockholder approval pursuant to Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. The Board has initially reserved 
300,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the 2022 Inducement Plan. 
As of December 31, 2024, there were 
1.6
 million shares available for future option grants or direct issuance under the Restated Plan and the 2022 Inducement Plan.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
As of December 31, 2024, 
24,493
 shares of our common stock are available for future issuance under the Amended Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP. The ESPP permits eligible employees to purchase up to 
1,250
 shares of Ligand common stock per calendar year at a discount through payroll deductions. The price at which stock is purchased under the ESPP is equal to 
85
% of the fair market value of the common stock on the first of a 
six
 month offering period or purchase date, whichever is lower. There were 
6,308
, 
5,080
 and 
8,479
 shares issued under the ESPP in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Share Repurchases 
In April 2023, our Board of Directors has approved a stock repurchase program authorizing, but not requiring, the repurchase of up to $
50
 million of our common stock from time to time through April 2026. We expect to acquire shares, if at all, primarily through open-market transactions in accordance with all applicable requirements of Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions will be determined by management based on our evaluation of market conditions, share price, legal requirements and other factors. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we did 
no
t repurchase any common stock, respectively. 
At-the Market Equity Offering Program
On September 30, 2022, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 (the “Shelf Registration Statement”), which became automatically effective upon filing, covering the offering of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants and units. 
On September 30, 2022, we also entered into an At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated (the “Agent”), under which we may, from time to time, sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $
100
 million in “at the market” offerings through the Agent (the “ATM Offering”). The Shelf Registration Statement included a prospectus covering the offering, issuance and sale of up to $
100
 million of our common stock from time to time through the ATM Offering. The shares to be sold under the Sales Agreement may be issued and sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we issued 
360,325
 shares of common stock in the ATM Offering, generating proceeds of $
37.4
 million, net of commissions and other transaction costs. During the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not issue any shares of common stock in the ATM Offering.
12. 
Commitment and Contingencies: Legal Proceedings
We record an estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable and estimable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss and no amount in the range is more likely than any other number in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim in accordance with ASC 450, 
Contingencies
. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revises our estimates. Revisions in our estimates of potential liability could materially impact our results of operations. 
On October 31, 2019, we received 
three
 civil complaints filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio on behalf of several Indian tribes. The Northern District of Ohio is the Court that the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation (“JPML”) has assigned more than one thousand civil cases which have been designated as a Multi-District Litigation (“MDL”) and captioned In Re: National Prescription Opiate Litigation. The allegations in these complaints focus on the activities of defendants other than the Company and no individualized factual allegations have been advanced against us in any of the 
three
 complaints. We reject all claims raised in the complaints and intend to vigorously defend these matters. 
On August 22, 2024, CyDex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed a Verified Complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Bexson Biomedical, Inc. (“Bexson”), asserting claims for declaratory relief and breach of contract arising out of a Captisol In Vivo Agreement (the “In Vivo Agreement”) between the parties, pursuant to which CyDex provided Bexson with research-grade Captisol and related confidential and proprietary information for a potential new formulation of ketamine being developed by Bexson. CyDex alleges that Bexson breached its obligations under the In Vivo Agreement, including by misusing confidential information and materials provided by CyDex and by using CyDex’s confidential information and materials to file patent applications that purport to cover formulations that are “not ketamine.” CyDex also asserts that Bexson failed to return and destroy Cydex’s confidential information and materials as required by the Agreement. CyDex seeks relief including specific performance of certain co-ownership provisions of the Agreement and disgorgement from Bexson for any benefits obtained in violation of the In Vivo Agreement. On September 27, 2024, Bexson filed a Motion to Dismiss the Verified Complaint. A Verified Amended Complaint was filed by CyDex on November 6, 2024, and a Motion to Dismiss the Verified Amended Complaint was filed by Bexson on January 17, 2025. 
From time to time, we may also become subject to other legal proceedings or claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. We currently believe that none of the claims or actions pending against us is likely to have, individually or in the 
96
aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Given the unpredictability inherent in litigation, however, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters.

Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are shown below. We assess the positive and negative evidence to determine if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to realize the existing deferred tax assets. Our evaluation of evidence resulted in management concluding that the majority of our deferred tax assets will be realized. However, we maintain a valuation allowance to offset certain net deferred tax assets as management believes realization of such assets are uncertain as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
We offset all deferred tax assets and liabilities by jurisdiction, as well as any related valuation allowance, and present them on our consolidated balance sheet as a non-current deferred income tax asset or liability (as applicable). 
Deferred tax assets (liabilities) are comprised of the following (in thousands):

As of December 31, 2024, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards set to expire through 2037 of $
21.4
 million and $
162.8
 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2028. We also have $
6.2
 million of federal research and development credit carryforwards, which expire through 2040. We have $
29.5
 million of California research and development credit carryforwards that have no expiration date. In addition, we have approximately $
98.4
 million of non-U.S. net operating loss carryovers and approximately $
14.4
 million of non-U.S. capital loss carryovers that have no expiration date.
As of December 31, 2023, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards set to expire through 2037 of $
48.0
 million and $
165.1
 million of state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in 2028. We also had $
8.5
 million of federal research and development credit carryforwards, which expire through 2040. We had $
29.4
 million of California research and development credit carryforwards that have no expiration date. In addition, we had approximately $
95.5
 million of non-U.S. net operating loss carryovers and approximately $
16.5
 million of non-U.S. capital loss carryovers that have no expiration date. 
Pursuant to Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, utilization of our net operating losses and credits may be subject to annual limitations in the event of any significant future changes in its ownership structure. These annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization. The deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024 are net of any previous limitations due to Section 382 and 383.
We account for income taxes by evaluating a probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The minimum threshold is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our remaining liabilities for uncertain tax positions are presented net of the deferred tax asset balances on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

20.7
 million of tax benefits that, if recognized would impact the effective rate. There are no positions for which it is reasonably possible that the uncertain tax benefit will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months.
We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we recognized an immaterial amount of interest and penalties. We file income tax returns in the United States, various state jurisdictions, Austria, and United Kingdom with varying statutes of limitations. The federal statute of limitation remains open for the 2021 tax year to the present. he United Kingdom statute of limitation remains open for the 2020 tax year to the present. The Austrian statute of limitation remains open for the 2020 tax year to the present. Net operating loss and research credit carryforwards arising prior to these years are also open to examination if and when utilized. The Company's 2019 and 2020 California tax returns are under examination by the California Franchise Tax Board. The Company does not anticipate that the examination will result in a material adjustment to its financial statements. No other income tax returns are currently under examination. We believe our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits and contingent tax issues is adequate with respect to all open years.

Subsequent Event
On February 24, 2025, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Castle Creek Biosciences, Inc., Castle Creek Biosciences, LLC (collectively, “Castle Creek”) and a syndicate of co-investors for which Ligand acted as representative (collectively, including Ligand, the “Purchasers”), to support Castle Creek’s autologous human fibroblast cell-based gene therapy genetically modified to express COL7, also known as FCX-007 (dabocemagene autoficel) (“D-Fi”) Phase 3 clinical study, its lead candidate for patients with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (“DEB”). 
Pursuant to the Agreement, we and the other Purchasers obtained, for an aggregate purchase price of $
75
 million, $
50
 million of which was paid by Ligand and $
25
 million of which was paid by the other Purchasers collectively, (i) a high single digit royalty on worldwide sales of D-Fi and (ii) warrants to purchase shares of Castle Creek Biosciences, Inc. Series D-1 Preferred Stock. 
99
In connection with the transaction we also acquired an unsecured subordinated promissory note issued by Castle Creek Biosciences, LLC with an aggregate principal amount of $
8.3
 million, which is due and payable upon Castle Creek’s receipt of U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of D-Fi for treatment of DEB and certain other conditions to payment. We paid $
1.8
 million for the unsecured subordinated promissory note.
Item 9.
Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.

Item 9A.
Controls and Procedures
(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We are responsible for maintaining disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, and have concluded we have remediated our previously reported material weakness described below and our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024.
(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with our management and directors; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) as set forth in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our evaluation under the 2013 framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, management concluded that we have remediated our previously reported material weakness in our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2024.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
The following material weakness was identified by the Company in its fiscal year ended December 31, 2023: management concluded that the Company did not implement and maintain effective controls related to the valuation of the acquired intangible and contract liability, specifically controls over the review of cash flow forecasts used in the valuation of the acquired intangible asset and the discount rate used in the valuation of the contract liability. The deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting due to the material weakness described above did not result in any misstatement in our consolidated financial statements or other disclosures. These deficiencies created, however, a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement in our consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
100
Remediation of Certain Previously Identified Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
In an effort to address the identified material weakness and enhance our internal controls related to our business combination purchase price allocation process, we continue to maintain our financial reporting process we followed to prepare consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP for audit committee meetings on a quarterly and annual basis. We have hired additional accounting personnel and third party consultants with appropriate knowledge, experience, and/or training commensurate with our technical accounting and financial reporting requirements to enhance the process going forward. Our ongoing remediation efforts are focused on continued employee training related to internal control over financial reporting. As a result of these remediation activities, management has determined that management's controls were designed appropriately and at a sufficient level of precision, and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time, such that the material weakness previously identified as of December 31, 2023 has been remediated as of December 31, 2024.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Except as discussed above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our latest fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Our implementation of our remediating plans for the material weakness, described above, resulted in changes in our internal control over financial reporting.
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and has issued an attestation report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.

We have audited Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
