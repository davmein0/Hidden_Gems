Our IT Security Operations team administers and monitors the prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of potential cybersecurity risks. This team leverages both Bio-Techne’s internal IT resources, including its personnel, as well as managed security service providers and other 
third-party
 security software and technology services, as well as through other means. We also have implemented processes and technologies for network monitoring and data loss prevention procedures.
​
We conduct periodic risk assessments, including with support from external vendors, to assess our cyber program, identify areas of enhancement, and develop strategies for the mitigation of cyber risks. 
We also conduct regular security testing and have established a vulnerability management process supported by security testing, for the treatment of identified security risks based on severity, including risks arising from our use of third-party providers software and service providers. In addition to our evolving processes and systems, we foster a culture of cybersecurity education, training, and testing. Every year, employees must take and pass rigorous information security and protection training. 
​
We partner with experienced external consultants to assess our cybersecurity program, and to perform penetration testing as well as other testing programs designed to identify vulnerabilities and areas for fortification. Also, as part of our cybersecurity risk management program we maintain cyber insurance, with coverage amounts and terms that are typical and appropriate for a company of our size and type. This insurance may not be sufficient to cover us against all types of claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches.
