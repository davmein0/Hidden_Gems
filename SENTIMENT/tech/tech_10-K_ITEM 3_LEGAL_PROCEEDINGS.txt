The Company’s common stock is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol “TECH”. Prior period results have been adjusted to reflect the four-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend on November 29, 2022. See Note 1 for details. 
Holders of Common Stock and Dividends Paid
As of August 12, 2025, there were over 170,000 beneficial shareholders of the Company’s common stock and over 110 shareholders of record. The Company paid annual cash dividends totaling $50.4 million, $50.4 million, and $50.3 million in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The Board of Directors periodically considers the payment of cash dividends, and there is no guarantee that the Company will pay comparable cash dividends, or any cash dividends, in the future.
On August 31, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Agreement that provides for a revolving credit facility of $1 billion, which can be increased by an additional $400 million subject to certain conditions. The credit facility is governed by a Credit Agreement dated August 31, 2022 and matures on August 31, 2027. The Credit Agreement that governs the revolving line of credit contains customary events of default and would prohibit payment of dividends to Company shareholders in the event of a default thereunder.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA
RESERVED
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. We provide quantitative information about the material sales drivers including the effect of acquisitions and changes in foreign currency at the corporate and segment level. We also provide quantitative information about discrete tax items and other significant factors we believe are useful for understanding our results. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial information and related notes included in this Form 10-K. This discussion contains various “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and also contains various “Forward-Looking Statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We refer readers to the statements entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” located at the end of this MD&A and “Forward-Looking Information and Cautionary Statements” and “Risk Factors” within Items 1 and 1A of this Form 10-K.
OVERVIEW
Bio-Techne develops, manufactures and sells life science reagents, instruments and services for the research and clinical diagnostic markets worldwide. With our deep product portfolio and application expertise, we sell integral components of scientific investigations into biological processes and molecular diagnostics, revealing the nature, diagnosis, etiology and progression of specific diseases. Our products aid in drug discovery efforts and provide the means for accurate clinical tests and diagnoses.
We manage the business in two operating segments – our Protein Sciences segment and our Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment. Our Protein Sciences segment is a leading developer and manufacturer of high-quality biological reagents used in all aspects of life science research, diagnostics and cell and gene therapy. This segment also includes proteomic analytical tools, both manual and automated, that offer researchers and pharmaceutical manufacturers efficient and streamlined options for automated western blot and multiplexed ELISA workflow. Our Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment develops and manufactures diagnostic products, including controls, calibrators, and diagnostic assays for the regulated diagnostics market, exosome-based molecular diagnostic assays, advanced tissue-based in-situ hybridization assays and instrumentation for spatial genomic and tissue biopsy analysis, and genetic and oncology kits for research and clinical applications.
RECENT ACQUISITIONS
A key component of the Company's strategy is to augment internal growth at existing businesses with complementary acquisitions. As disclosed in Note 4, the Company completed the acquisition of Lunaphore in fiscal 2024 for $169.7 million, in a cash-free, debt-free acquisition. We also purchased a 19.9% investment in Wilson Wolf in fiscal 2023 and, as disclosed in Note 1, will acquire the remaining shares in Wilson Wolf by the end of calendar year 2027, or earlier depending on the achievement of certain future milestones.
OVERALL RESULTS
Operational Update
For fiscal 2025, consolidated net sales increased 5% to $1.2 billion as compared to fiscal 2024. Organic growth was 5%, and foreign currency translation and a business held-for-sale did not have a material impact. Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by strong commercial execution in our Protein Sciences segment
.
​
Consolidated net earnings for fiscal 2025 decreased 56% compared to fiscal 2024. The decrease in earnings was impacted by a non-recurring loss on an arbitration award, impairment of assets held-for-sale, and restructuring and restructuring-related charges. After adjusting for cost recognized upon sale of acquired inventory, intangibles amortization, acquisition-related costs, certain litigation charges, gain on sale of investments, stock-based compensation, restructuring and restructuring-related costs, impairment of assets held-for-sale, and impact of business held-for-sale, adjusted net earnings 
33

Table of Contents
increased 8% in fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024. Adjusted net earnings was primarily impacted by favorable volume leverage within Protein Sciences. 
For fiscal 2024, consolidated net sales increased 2% as compared to fiscal 2023. Organic growth was 1%, with acquisitions having a favorable impact of 1%. Foreign currency translation and a business held-for-sale did not have a material impact. Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by strong commercial execution in our Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment
.

Consolidated net earnings for fiscal 2024, including non-controlling interest, decreased 41% compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease in earnings was driven by a non-recurring gain on the sale of our ChemoCentryx, Inc. (CCXI) investment, a non-recurring gain on the sale of our investment in Eminence, and a non-recurring benefit related to the fair value of contingent consideration during fiscal 2023.

Gross Margins
Consolidated gross margins were 64.8%, 66.4%, and 67.7% in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023. Consolidated gross margin in fiscal year 2025 was impacted by the reinstatement of incentive accruals and product mix. Excluding the impact of acquired inventory sold, amortization of intangibles, stock compensation expense, restructuring and restructuring-related costs, impact of business held-for-sale, and the impact of partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries, adjusted gross margins were 70.4%, 71.0%, and 71.7% in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Fiscal 2025 consolidated gross margin was impacted by the resinstatement of incentive accruals and an unfavorable product mix when compared to the prior period. Fiscal 2024 consolidated gross margin was impacted by the Lunaphore acquisition when compared to the prior period. Fiscal 2023 consolidated gross margin was unfavorably impacted by foreign currency exchange and strategic growth investments including the Namocell acquisition.

Fluctuations in adjusted gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, have primarily resulted from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in product mix. We expect that, in the future, gross margins will continue to be impacted by the mix of our portfolio growing at different rates as well as future acquisitions.
Management uses adjusted operating results to monitor and evaluate performance of the Company’s two segments. Segment gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, were as follows:

The decrease in the Protein Sciences segment’s gross margin percentage for fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024 was primarily attributable to the mix of product sales within the segment. The change in the Protein Sciences segment’s gross margin percentage for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 was primarily attributable to the exclusion of a business held-for-sale.
The decrease in the Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment’s gross margin percentage for fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024 is primarily attributable to reinstatement of incentive accruals and an unfavorable mix of product sales within the segment. The change in the Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment’s gross margin percentage for fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023 is due to the Lunaphore acquisition.

The change in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024 was driven by share-based compensation as the number of stock option exercises increased compared to the prior year comparative period. The Company had share-based compensation excess tax benefits of $4.5 million in fiscal 2025. The Company’s discrete tax benefits in fiscal 2024 primarily related to share-based compensation excess tax benefits of $18.4 million. The Company’s discrete tax benefits in fiscal 2023 primarily related to share-based compensation excess tax benefits of $12.3 million.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments at June 30, 2025 were $162.2 million compared to $152.9 million at June 30, 2024. Included in the available-for-sale investments were certificates of deposit that have contractual maturity dates within one year of $1.1 million as of June 30, 2024. There were no certificiates of deposit as of June 30, 2025. 
At June 30, 2025, approximately 34% of the Company’s cash and cash equivalent account balances of $55.2 million were located in the U.S., with the remainder located in primarily in Canada, China, the U.K. and other European countries.
At June 30, 2025, we had $346.0 million in borrowings under the revolving credit facility, resulting in $654.0 million of unutilized availability under our revolving credit facility. 
The Company has either paid U.S. taxes on its undistributed foreign earnings or intends to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings in the foreign operations or expects the earnings will be remitted in a tax neutral transaction. Management of the Company expects to be able to meet its cash and working capital requirements for operations, facility expansion, capital additions, and cash dividends for the foreseeable future, and at least the next 12 months, through currently available funds, including funds available through our line-of-credit and cash generated from operations.
Future acquisition strategies may or may not require additional borrowings under the line-of-credit facility or other outside sources of funding.
Cash Flows From Operating Activities
The Company generated cash from operations of $287.6 million, $299.0 million, and $254.4 million in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash generated from operating activities in fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024 was mainly a result of changes in the timing of cash payments on certain operating assets and liabilities. The increase in cash generated from operating activities in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023 was mainly a result of changes in the timing of cash payments on certain operating assets and liabilities. 
Cash Flows From Investing Activities
We continue to make investments in our business, including capital expenditures to enable revenue growth.

Table of Contents
During fiscal 2024, the Company acquired Lunaphore for $169.7 million in cash-free, debt-free acquisition. During fiscal 2023, the Company acquired Namocell for $101.2 million, net of cash acquired. There were no acquisitions in fiscal 2025. 
During fiscal 2025, the Company invested $15.0 million into Spear Bio. Additionally in fiscal 2025, the Company received $2.4 million from the sale of assets held-for-sale. There were no comparable activities in fiscal 2024 and 2023. 
During the first fiscal quarter of 2023, the Company sold its remaining shares in Eminence, its partially-owned consolidated subsidiary, for $17.8 million. There were no sales of businesses in fiscal 2025 or 2024. 
In the first fiscal quarter of 2023, the Company sold its remaining shares in its investment in CCXI for $73.2 million. There were no comparable activities in fiscal 2025 and 2024.
The Company’s net proceeds from the purchase, sale and maturity of available-for-sale investments in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023 were $1.1 million, $22.6 million, and $14.7 million, respectively. During fiscal 2025, the Company’s proceeds in available-for-sale investments relates to our certificates of deposits maturing. During fiscal 2024, the Company’s proceeds in available-for-sale investments relates to the sale of our exchange traded investment grade bond funds. The proceeds during fiscal 2023 relates to the sale of excess cash in certificates of deposit that matured. The Company’s investment policy is to place excess cash in certificates of deposit with the objective of obtaining the highest possible return while minimizing risk and keeping the funds accessible.
Capital additions in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023 were $31.0 million, $62.9 million, and $38.2 million. Fiscal 2025 capital expenditures related to investments in new buildings, machinery, construction in progress, and IT equipment. Fiscal 2024 capital expenditures related to investments in new buildings, machinery, construction in progress, and IT equipment. Fiscal 2023 capital expenditures related to investments in new buildings, machinery, and IT equipment. Capital additions planned for fiscal 2026 are approximately $42 million and are expected to be financed through currently available cash and cash generated from operations.
During fiscal 2022, the Company paid $25 million to enter into a two-part forward contract which requires the Company to purchase the full equity interest in Wilson Wolf if certain annual revenue or EBITDA thresholds are met. During fiscal 2023, Wilson Wolf met the EBITDA target and the Company paid an additional $232 million to acquire 19.9% of Wilson Wolf. Since the first part of the forward contract has been triggered, the second part of the forward contract will automatically trigger, which requires the Company to acquire the remaining 80.1% of Wilson Wolf on December 31, 2027. The second part of the contract would be accelerated in advance of December 31, 2027 if Wilson Wolf meets certain financial milestones. As of June 30, 2025, the second milestones have not been met. The second option payment of approximately $1 billion plus potential contingent consideration is forecasted to occur between fiscal 2026 and fiscal 2028. During fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Company received distributions from Wilson Wolf of $7.3 million and $7.0 million, repectively. 
Cash Flows From Financing Activities
In fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, the Company paid cash dividends of $50.4 million, $50.4 million, $50.3 million, respectively. The Board of Directors periodically considers the payment of cash dividends.
The Company received $51.7 million, $60.9 million, $29.8 million, for the exercise of options for 1,209,000, 2,240,000, and 1,578,000 shares of common stock in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
During fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, the Company repurchased $275.7 million, $80.0 million, and $19.6 million, respectively, in share repurchases included as a cash outflow within Financing Activities.
During fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, the Company drew $104.0 million, $225.0 million, and $619.7 million, respectively, under its revolving line-of-credit facility. Repayments of $77.0 million, $256.0 million, and $525.7 million were made on its line-of-credit in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.
During fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid $6.5 million, $21.9 million and $28.9 million, respectively, for taxes remitted on behalf of participants in net share settlement transactions, restricted stock, and restricted stock units.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
The Company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its business operations and an understanding of results of operations. The listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies; investors should also refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Business Combinations
We allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition. The calculations used to determine the fair value of the long-lived assets acquired, primarily intangible assets, can be complex and require significant judgment. We weigh many factors when completing these estimates including, but not limited to, the nature of the acquired company’s business; its competitive position, strengths, and challenges; its historical financial position and performance; estimated customer retention rates; discount rates; and future plans for the combined entity. We may also engage independent valuation specialists, when necessary, to assist in the fair value calculations for significant acquired long-lived assets.
The fair value of acquired technology is generally the primary asset identified and therefore estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method. The multi-period excess earnings method model estimates revenues and cash flows derived from the primary asset and then deducts portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting assets, such as trade names and in-process research and development, that contributed to the generation of the cash flows. The resulting cash flow, which is attributable solely to the primary asset acquired, is then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value. The trade name fair value is generally calculated using the relief from royalty method, which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the technology. Assumed royalty rates are applied to the projected revenues for the remaining useful life of the technology to estimate the royalty savings. In-process research and development assets are valued using the multi-period excess earnings method when the cash flows from the in-process research and development assets are separately identifiable from the primary asset. In circumstances that customer relationship assets are identified that are not the primary asset, they are valued using the distributor model income approach, which isolates revenues and cash flow associated with the sales and distribution function of the entity and attributable to customer-related assets, which are then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value.
We estimate the fair value of liabilities for contingent consideration by discounting to present value the probability weighted contingent payments expected to be made. For potential payments related to financial performance based milestones, projected revenue and/or EBITDA amounts, volatility and discount rates assumptions are included in the estimated amounts. For potential payments related to product development milestones, the fair value is based on the probability of achievement of such milestones. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis.
We are also required to estimate the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets, which determines the amount of acquisition-related amortization expense we will record in future periods. Each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining 
42

Table of Contents
useful lives of our amortizable intangibles to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.
While we use our best estimates and assumptions, our fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
The judgments required in determining the estimated fair values and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income. For example, different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ. Consequently, to the extent a longer-lived asset is ascribed greater value than a shorter-lived asset, net income in a given period may be higher. Additionally, assigning a lower value to amortizable intangibles would result in a higher amount assigned to goodwill. As goodwill is not amortized, this would benefit net income in a given period, although goodwill is subject to annual impairment analysis.
Impairment of Goodwill
Goodwill
Goodwill was $980.9 million as of June 30, 2025, which represented 38% of total assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that could indicate a possible impairment.
To analyze goodwill for impairment, we must assign our goodwill to individual reporting units. Identification of reporting units includes an analysis of the components that comprise each of our operating segments, which considers, among other things, the manner in which we operate our business and the availability of discrete financial information. Components of an operating segment are aggregated to form one reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. We periodically review our reporting units to ensure that they continue to reflect the manner in which we operate our business.
The Company tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation for goodwill is an assessment of factors including reporting unit specific operating results as well as industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for its reporting units and perform a quantitative test. 
The quantitative impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on the income approach. The income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit’s financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant. Using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques, we project revenue and apply our fixed and variable cost experience rate to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows. A terminal value is then applied to the projected cash flow stream. Future estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value. The discount rate used is the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics. In determining the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, we are required to estimate a number of factors, including projected operating results, terminal growth rates, economic conditions, anticipated future cash flows, the discount rate and the allocation of shared or corporate items. 
For fiscal 2025, we elected to perform a quantitative analysis for all five reporting units. The Company determined, after performing the quantitative analysis, there was no evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value was less than the carrying amounts. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as part of restructuring actions, certain assets and liabilities associated with a disposal group in our Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment were classified as held-for-sale as of May 31, 2025. Given the upcoming divestiture, the Company identified a triggering event and performed impairment testing during May 2025. The impairment test resulted in a total impairment charge of $83.1 million, which includes the allocated goodwill, which we have further described within Note 14. The Company did not identify any additional triggering events

after our annual goodwill impairment analysis through June 30, 2025, the date of our Consolidated Balance Sheets, that would require an additional goodwill impairment assessment to be performed.
For fiscal 2024, we elected to perform a qualitative analysis for all five reporting units. The Company determined, after performing the qualitative analysis, there was no evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value was less than the carrying amounts, therefore, it was not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test in fiscal 2024. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, as part of restructuring actions, certain assets and liabilities associated with a disposal group in our Protein Sciences segment were classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2023. Given the upcoming divestiture, the Company identified a triggering event and performed impairment testing during the second half of fiscal 2024. The impairment test resulted in a total impairment charge of $22.0 million, which includes the allocated goodwill, which we have further described within Note 14. The Company did not identify any triggering events after our annual goodwill impairment analysis through June 30, 2024, the date of our Consolidated Balance Sheets, that would require an additional goodwill impairment assessment to be performed.
For fiscal 2023, we elected to perform a qualitative analysis for all five reporting units. The Company determined, after performing the qualitative analysis, there was no evidence that it was more likely than not that the fair value was less than the carrying amounts, therefore, it was not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test in fiscal 2023. The Company did not identify any triggering events after our annual goodwill impairment analysis through June 30, 2023, the date of our Consolidated Balance Sheets, that would require an additional goodwill impairment assessment to be performed.
NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Information regarding the accounting policies adopted during fiscal 2025 and those not yet adopted can be found under caption “Note 1: Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements appear in Item 8 of this report.
SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On August 5, 2025, the Company announced the execution of a definitive agreement to sell the Exosome Diagnostics business for $15 million including $5 million of stock of the acquiring company at closing with the remainder received over the following four years. The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2026.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7, contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP). These non-GAAP measures include:
●
Organic growth
●
Adjusted gross margin
●
Adjusted operating margin
●
Adjusted net earnings
●
Adjusted effective tax rate
​
We provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results. We use these non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions, including with respect to incentive compensation. We believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for period-to-period comparison of results.
44

Table of Contents
Our non-GAAP financial measure of organic revenue represents revenue growth excluding revenue from acquisitions within the preceding 12 months, the impact of foreign currency, the impact of businesses held-for-sale, as well as the impact of partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries. Excluding these measures provides more useful period-to-period comparison of revenue results as it excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, which can vary significantly from period to period, and revenue from acquisitions that would not be included in the comparable prior period. Revenues from businesses held-for-sale are excluded from our organic revenue calculation starting on the date they become held-for-sale as those revenues will not be comparative in future periods. Revenues from partially-owned subsidiaries consolidated in our financial statements are also excluded from our organic revenue calculation, as those revenues are not fully attributable to the Company. There was no revenue from partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries in fiscal 2025 and 2024 due to the sale of Eminence in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue from partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries was $2.0 million for fiscal 2023.
Our non-GAAP financial measures for adjusted gross margin, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, exclude stock-based compensation, which is inclusive of the employer portion of payroll taxes on those stock awards, the costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory, amortization of acquisition intangibles, restructuring and restructuring-related costs, and other non-recurring items including non-recurring costs, goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, and gains. Stock-based compensation is excluded from non-GAAP adjusted net earnings because of the nature of this charge, specifically the varying available valuation methodologies, subjection assumptions, variety of award types, and unpredictability of amount and timing of employer related tax obligations. The Company excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets, purchase accounting adjustments, including costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory and acquisition-related expenses inclusive of the changes in fair value contingent consideration, and other non-recurring items including gains or losses on goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, and one-time assessments from this measure because they occur as a result of specific events, and are not reflective of our internal investments, the costs of developing, producing, supporting and selling our products, and the other ongoing costs to support our operating structure. We also exclude certain litigation charges which are facts and circumstances specific including costs to resolve litigation and legal settlement (gains and losses). In some cases, these costs may be a result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were not probable, inestimable, or unresolved at the time of acquisition. Costs related to restructuring and restructuring-related activities, including reducing overhead and consolidating facilities, are excluded because we believe they are not indicative of our normal operating costs. Additionally, these amounts can vary significantly from period to period based on current activity. The Company also excludes revenue and expense attributable to partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries as well as revenue and expense attributable to businesses held-for-sale in the calculation of our non-GAAP financial measures.
The Company’s non-GAAP adjusted operating margin and adjusted net earnings, in total and on a per share basis, also excludes acquisition related expenses inclusive of the changes in fair value of contingent consideration, gain and losses from investments, as they are not part of our day-to-day operating decisions (excluding our equity method investment in Wilson Wolf as it is certain to be acquired in the future), certain adjustments to income tax expense, and other non-recurring items including certain costs related to the transition to a new CEO. Additionally, gains and losses from investments that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability are excluded. The Company independently calculates a non-GAAP adjusted tax rate to be applied to the identified non-GAAP adjustments considering the impact of discrete items on these adjustments and the jurisdictional mix of the adjustments. In addition, the tax impact of other discrete and non-recurring charges which impact our reported GAAP tax rate are adjusted from net earnings. We believe these tax items can significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs and/or income associated with historical trends and future results.
The Company periodically reassesses the components of our non-GAAP adjustments for changes in how we evaluate our performance, changes in how we make financial and operational decisions, and considers the use of these measures by our competitors and peers to ensure the adjustments are still relevant and meaningful.
Readers are encouraged to review the reconciliations of the adjusted financial measures used in management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition of the Company to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures provided within the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK
The Company operates internationally, and thus is subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Approximately 32% of the Company’s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2025 were made in foreign currencies, including 15% in euro, 4% in British pound sterling, 5% in Chinese yuan, 3% in Canadian dollars, 1% in Swiss francs, and the remaining 4% in other currencies. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the euro, British pound sterling, Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar, and Swiss franc as compared to the U.S. dollar as the financial position and operating results of the Company’s foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation.
Month-end exchange rates between the euro, British pound sterling, Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc and the U.S. dollar, which have not been weighted for actual sales volume in the applicable months in the periods, were as follows:

The Company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from trade receivables and intercompany payables denominated in one currency in the financial statements, but receivable or payable in another currency.
The Company does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted intercompany sales transactions or on intercompany foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in Other non-operating (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The effect of translating net assets of foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as part of Accumulated other comprehensive loss.
The effects of a hypothetical simultaneous 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar from June 30, 2025 levels against the euro, British pound sterling, Chinese yuan, Canadian dollar and Swiss francs are as follows (in thousands):

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors
Bio-Techne Corporation:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Bio-Techne Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
​
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated August 22, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
​
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
​
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
​
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
​
Sufficiency of audit evidence over net sales
​
As discussed in Note 2 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue for sales of consumables and instruments at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer. The Company recorded $1,219.6 million of net sales for the year ended June 30, 2025. 
​
48

Table of Contents
We identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of audit evidence over net sales as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained required especially subjective auditor judgment because of the dispersion of the Company’s net sales generating activities across locations. This included determining the Company locations at which procedures were performed. 
​
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor judgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over net sales, including the determination of the Company locations at which those procedures were to be performed. At each Company location where procedures were performed, we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s net sales processes, including the Company’s controls over the accurate recording of sales amounts. We 1) performed software-assisted data analyses to test the relationships among certain sales transactions and 2) assessed the recorded net sales for a selection of transactions by comparing the amounts recognized for consistency with underlying documentation, including contracts with customers, shipping documentation, customer acceptance, and payments.
​
We evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of procedures performed, including the nature and extent of such evidence.

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors 
Bio-Techne Corporation:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Bio-Techne Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission.
We
 also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated August 22, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
​
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying 
Controls and Procedures.
 Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintain
ed in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
​
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Bio-Techne Corporation and Subsidiaries
Years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023
Note 
1. 
Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:
Description of business:
 Bio-Techne and its subsidiaries, collectively doing business as Bio-Techne Corporation (the Company), develop, manufacture and sell life science reagents, instruments and services for the research and clinical diagnostic markets worldwide. With our deep product portfolio and application expertise, we sell integral components of scientific investigations into biological processes and molecular diagnostics, revealing the nature, diagnosis, etiology and progression of specific diseases. Our products aid in drug discovery efforts and provide the means for accurate clinical tests and diagnoses.
At the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders of the Company held on October 27, 2022, the shareholders approved an amendment and restatement of the Company’s articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock from 
100,000,000
 to 
400,000,000
. On November 1, 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved and declared a 
four
-for-one split of the Company’s common stock in the form of a stock dividend. Each stockholder of record on November 14, 2022 received 
three
 additional shares of common stock for each then-held share, which were distributed after close of trading on November 29, 2022. All share and per share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the stock split.
Use of estimates:
 The preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable, available-for-sale investments, inventory, intangible assets, contingent consideration, stock-based compensation and income taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Principles of consolidation:
 The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
 As Eminence met the criteria for consolidation, the transaction was accounted for in accordance with 
Accounting Standards Codification
 (ASC) 
805,

Business Combinations
. In applying 
ASC 
805
 to the transaction, the Company has elected to include Eminence in our Consolidated Financial Statements on a one month lag. As noted below, Eminence was sold during the first fiscal quarter of 2023. 
Equity method investments: 
The Company accounts for its equity method investments in accordance with ASC 
323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures. 
The Company initially records its equity method investments at the amount of the Company’s investment and adjusts each period for the Company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and dividends paid. Distributions from the equity method investee are accounted for using the cumulative earnings approach on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
In December 2021, the Company paid $
25
 million to enter into a two-part forward contract which requires the Company to make an initial ownership investment followed by purchase of full equity interest in Wilson Wolf if certain annual revenue or annual EBITDA thresholds are met. Wilson Wolf is a leading manufacturer of cell culture devices, including the G-Rex product line. The first part of the forward contract was triggered upon Wilson Wolf achieving approximately $
92
 million in annual revenue or $
55
 million in EBITDA at any point prior to December 31, 2027. During the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the Company determined that Wilson Wolf had met the EBITDA target. On March 31, 2023, the Company paid an additional $
232
 million to acquire 
19.9
% of Wilson Wolf, which is accounted for as an equity method investment.
Since the first part of the forward contract has been triggered, the second part of the forward contract will automatically trigger, and requires the Company to acquire the remaining equity interest in Wilson Wolf on December 31, 2027 based on a revenue multiple of approximately 
4.4
 times trailing twelve month revenue. The second part of the contract would be accelerated in advance of December 31, 2027, if Wilson Wolf meets its second milestone of approximately $
226
 million 
55

Table of Contents
in annual revenue or $
136
 million in annual EBITDA. If the second milestone is achieved, the forward contract requires the Company to pay approximately $
1
 billion plus potential consideration for revenue in excess of the revenue milestone.
Translation of foreign financial statements
: Assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign operations are translated at year-end rates of exchange and the resulting gains and losses arising from the translation of net assets located outside the U.S. are recorded as Other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The cumulative translation adjustment is a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Foreign statements of earnings are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in Other non-operating income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income.
Revenue recognition:

ASC 606
 provides revenue recognition guidance for any entity that enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of non-financial assets, unless those contracts are within the scope of other accounting standards. The core principle of 
ASC 606
 is that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Refer to Note 2 for additional information regarding our revenue recognition policy under 
ASC 606
.
Research and development:
 Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred. Development activities generally relate to creating new products, improving or creating variations of existing products, or modifying existing products to meet new applications.
Advertising costs:
 Advertising expenses were $
3.2
 million, $
4.1
 million, and $
4.8
 million for fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Advertising expenditures are expensed as incurred.
Income taxes:
 The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to record the income tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return are recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. Refer to Note 12 for additional information regarding income taxes.
Comprehensive income: 
Comprehensive income includes charges and credits to shareholders’ equity that are not the result of transactions with shareholders. Our total comprehensive income consists of net income, unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments, and foreign currency translation adjustments. The items of comprehensive income, with the exception of net income, are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity. Any tax effects, if applicable, associated with reclassifications of accumulated other comprehensive income to net income are reflected in the provision for income taxes. 
Cash and cash equivalents:
 Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly-liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Available-for-sale investments:
 Available-for-sale investments consist of debt instruments with original maturities of generally three months to less than one-year and equity securities. Available-for-sale investments are recorded based on trade-date. The Company considers all of its marketable securities available-for-sale and reports them at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale securities are included within Other income (expense).
Trade accounts receivable and allowances: 
Trade accounts receivable are initially recorded at the invoiced amount upon the sale of goods or services to customers, and they do not bear interest. They are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts, which represent estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make the required payments. When determining the allowances for doubtful accounts, we take several factors into consideration, including the overall 
56

Table of Contents
composition of accounts receivable aging, our prior history of accounts receivable write-offs, the type of customer and our day-to-day knowledge of specific customers. Changes in the allowances for doubtful accounts are included in Selling, general, & administrative expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The point at which uncollected accounts are written off varies by type of customer. The Company does not have material long-term customer receivables. 
Inventories:
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. The Company regularly reviews inventory on hand for slow-moving and obsolete inventory, inventory not meeting quality control standards and inventory subject to expiration.
For certain proteins, antibodies, and chemically based manufactured products, the Company produces larger batches of established products than current sales requirements due to economies of scale through a highly controlled manufacturing process. Accordingly, the manufacturing process for these products has and will continue to produce quantities in excess of forecasted usage. The Company forecasts usage for its products based on several factors including historical demand, current market dynamics, and technological advances. The Company forecasts product usage on an individual product level for a period that is consistent with our ability to reasonably forecast inventory usage for that product. There have been no material changes to the Company’s estimates of the net realizable value for excess and obsolete inventory or other types of inventory reserves and inventory cost adjustments in the fiscal years presented. Additionally, current and historical reserves recorded to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value become part of the new cost basis for the inventory item in accordance with 
ASC 330 - Inventory
.
Property and equipment:
 Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of 
3
 to 
5 years
. Buildings, building improvements and leasehold improvements are depreciated over estimated useful lives of 
5
 to 
40 years
.
Contingencies: 
The Company records a liability in the Consolidated Financial Statements on an undiscounted basis for loss contingencies related to legal actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and the amount may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. 
Contingent Consideration:
 Contingent Consideration relates to the potential payment for an acquisition that is contingent upon the achievement of the acquired business meeting certain product development milestones and/or certain financial performance milestones. The Company records contingent consideration at fair value at the date of acquisition based on the consideration expected to be transferred. For potential payments related to financial performance milestones, we use a real option model in calculating the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities. The assumptions utilized in the calculation based on financial performance milestones include projected revenue and/or EBITDA amounts, volatility and discount rates. For potential payments related to product development milestones, we estimated the fair value based on the probability of achievement of such milestones. The assumptions utilized in the calculation of the acquisition date fair value include probability of success and the discount rates. Contingent consideration involves certain assumptions requiring significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. Contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period, and subsequent changes in fair value, including accretion for the passage of time, are recognized within Selling, general and administrative in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income.
Intangible assets: 
Intangible assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization expense is generally determined on the straight-line basis over periods ranging from 
1 year
 to 
20 years
. Each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our amortizable intangibles to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If our estimate of an asset’s remaining useful life is revised, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.
Impairment of long-lived assets and amortizable intangibles: 
We evaluate the recoverability of property, plant, equipment and amortizable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to, (1) a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, (2) a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or in its physical condition, 
57

Table of Contents
or (3) an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset. We compare the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with it. If the sum of the expected future net cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated, an impairment loss would be recognized. The impairment loss would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. As quoted market prices are not available for the majority of our assets, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including the discounted value of estimated future cash flows.
The evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated. These assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024 there was a triggering event for the assets and liabilities associated with a disposal group in our Protein Sciences segment that were classified as held-for-sale. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 there was a triggering event for the assets and liabilities associated with a disposal group in our Diagnostics & Spatial Biology segment that were classified as held-for-sale. See Note 14 for additional details. No other triggering events were identified for property, plant, and equipment or amortizable intangibles during fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023.
Impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets: 
We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate a possible impairment. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to, (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate, (2) unanticipated competition, (3) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, or (4) an adverse change in market conditions that are indicative of a decline in the fair value of the assets.
To analyze goodwill, we must assign our goodwill to individual reporting units. Identification of reporting units includes an analysis of the components that comprise each of our operating segments, which considers, among other things, the manner in which we operate our business and the availability of discrete financial information. Components of an operating segment are aggregated to form one reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. We periodically review our reporting units to ensure that they continue to reflect the manner in which we operate our business. The Company had 
five
 reporting units for our 2025, 2024, and 2023 goodwill impairment assessment performed on April 1 of each of the respective fiscal years, the date of our annual goodwill impairment assessment.
The Company tests goodwill for impairment by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test. The qualitative evaluation for goodwill is an assessment of factors including reporting unit specific operating results as well as industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair values of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. The Company may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment for its reporting units and perform a quantitative test. 
The quantitative impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units based the income approach. The income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimate future cash flows using the reporting unit’s financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant. Using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques, we project revenue and apply our fixed and variable cost experience rate to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows. A terminal value is then applied to the projected cash flow stream. Future estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value. The discount rate used is the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics. In determining the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, we are required to estimate a number of factors, including projected operating results, terminal growth rates, economic conditions, anticipated future cash flows, the discount rate and the allocation of shared or corporate items. 
In our fiscal 2025 annual goodwill impairment assessment, we elected to perform a quantitative assessment for all 
five
 of our reporting units. No impairment was identified as part of the analysis performed as the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value. The Company did identify a triggering event related to a business held-for-sale, described in Note 14, in the fourth quarter after our annual goodwill impairment assessment, that led to an impairment of allocated goodwill.
For fiscal 2024 and 2023, we elected to perform a qualitative analysis for all 
five
 reporting units. The Company determined, after performing the qualitative analysis, there was no evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value was less 
58

Table of Contents
than the carrying amounts, therefore, it was not necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test in fiscal 2024 and 2023. There was a triggering event related to a business held-for-sale described later in this note, leading to an impairment of allocated goodwill during the second half of fiscal 2024. The Company did not identify any triggering events after our annual goodwill impairment analysis through June 30, 2024 and 2023, the date of our Consolidated Balance Sheets, that would require an additional goodwill impairment assessment to be performed.
For fiscal 2024, the Company also performed a qualitative assessment of the acquired in-process research and development assets to determine whether changes in events, circumstances, or the probability of successful development and commercialization of the assets indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the acquired assets are less than its carrying amount. Based on the analysis, the Company determined there was no indication of impairment of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. This in-process research and development was placed into service during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and will begin amortization over its expected useful life.
On September 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its equity shares of Eminence for approximately $
17.8
 million to a third party. Eminence was considered a variable-interest entity that was fully consolidated in our financial statements. Prior to the sale, Eminence had revenue of $
2.0
 million for the first fiscal quarter of 2023 within our Protein Sciences segment. As a result of the sale of the business, the Company recorded a gain of $
11.7
 million within the Other income (expense) line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. Prior to the sale of Eminence, a triggering event was identified in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and impairment testing was performed as Eminence was forecasted to not have sufficient cash to execute on their growth plan combined with their inability to secure additional financing. Our 
impairment
 testing resulted in a full impairment of the Eminence goodwill and intangibles assets for charges of $
8.3
 million and $
8.6
 million, 
respectively
, for fiscal 2022. The Company also recognized inventory and fixed asset impairment charges of $
0.9
 million and $
0.9
 million, respectively. These impairment charges were recorded within the Selling, general and administrative line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income for fiscal 2022. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, Eminence was able to secure cash deposits on future orders to provide funding for their operations. This delay in liquidation allowed time for securing of additional investor financing which coincided with the sale of the Company's investment.
Restructuring actions:
 Restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs, and impairments and disposals of assets associated with such actions. Employee-related severance charges are based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. These charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. Asset-related and other charges include impairment of right-of-use assets, leasehold improvements, other asset write-downs associated with combining operations, disposal of assets and other exit costs. Other costs also includes restructuring-related charges, which are incremental costs incurred directly supporting business transformation initiatives tied to the restructuring action. Refer to Note 14 for additional information regarding restructuring actions.
Legal Matters: 
The Company and its affiliates are involved in a number of legal actions from time to time involving product liability, employment, intellectual property and commercial disputes, shareholder related matters, environmental proceedings, tax disputes, and governmental proceedings and investigations. With respect to governmental proceedings and investigations, like other companies in our industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by national, state, and local governmental agencies in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate. The Company’s standard practice is to cooperate with regulators and investigators in responding to inquiries. The outcomes of legal actions are not within the Company’s complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages, as well as other remedies (including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding), that could require significant expenditures, result in lost revenues, or limit the Company's ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions.
​
The Company records a liability in the Consolidated Financial Statements on an undiscounted basis for loss contingencies related to legal actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. When determining the 
59

Table of Contents
estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required. Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery, involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages, potentially involve penalties, fines or punitive damages, or could result in a change in business practice. The Company classifies certain specified litigation charges and gains related to significant legal matters as certain litigation charges in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. 
​
In August 2024, 
791,204
 shares of outstanding vested stock options related to former employees expired, which have now been excluded from the Company’s dilutive EPS calculation for fiscal 2025. Of the 
791,204
 shares, 
779,084
 shares belonged to the Company’s former CEO. The expiration date of these options was previously under dispute. The dispute with the former CEO was resolved through a binding arbitration award during the quarter ended March 31, 2025 for which the Company paid $
37.2
 million inclusive of interest and legal fees. The dispute regarding the remaining 
12,120
 shares was resolved during the quarter ended March 31, 2025 resulting in total payments of $
0.5
 million.
​
During fiscal 2025 and 2024, the Company recognized $
41.8
 million and $
3.5
 million, respectively, of certain litigation charges. There was no comparable activity in fiscal 2023. As of each of the balance sheet dates presented, there was 
no
 accrued litigation. The ultimate cost to the Company with respect to accrued litigation could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. The Company includes accrued litigation in Other current liabilities and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. While it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the legal matters discussed below, the Company believes it is possible that the costs associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.
​
Intellectual Property Matters: 
At any given time, the Company is involved in litigation relating to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property (IP) rights, and licenses, acquisitions or other agreements related to such rights. This litigation includes, but it not limited to, alleged infringement or misappropriation of IP rights, or breach of obligations related to IP rights, or other claims asserted by competitors, individuals, or entities created specifically to fund IP litigation. While the outcome of these litigation matters is inherently uncertain, it is possible that the results of such litigation could require the Company to pay significant monetary damages.

Newly Adopted Accounting Standards
In November 2023, the FASB issued 
ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280)
, which requires incremental disclosures on reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures on significant segment expenses. The Company adopted this guidance beginning with this annual report and this guidance will be applied to interim periods starting in fiscal 2026 on a retrospective basis. Refer to Note 13 for our segment reporting disclosures.
Not Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2023, the FASB issued 
ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740)
, which requires incremental annual disclosures on income taxes, including rate reconciliations, income taxes paid, and other disclosures. 
60

Table of Contents
The Company will adopt this guidance beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2026 for our annual report. This accounting standard will increase disclosures in the Company’s annual reporting but will have no impact on reported income tax expense or related income tax assets or liabilities.
In November 2024, the FASB issued 
ASU 2024-03, Income Statement –Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)
, which requires incremental disclosures on purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and other expenses. The Company will adopt this guidance beginning with our annual report for fiscal 2027. This accounting standard will increase disclosures in the Company’s annual reporting but will have no impact on reported income statement expenses.
Other than the items noted above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective that we believe have a significant impact, or potential significant impact, on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Note 2

 Revenue Recognition:
Consumables revenues consist of specialized proteins, immunoassays, antibodies, reagents, blood chemistry and blood gas quality controls, and hematology instrument controls that are typically single-use products recognized at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. Instruments revenues typically consist of longer lived assets that, for the substantial majority of sales, are recognized at a point in time in a manner similar to consumables. Service revenues consist of extended warranty contracts, post contract support, and custom development projects that are recognized over time as either the customers receive and consume the benefits of such services simultaneously or the underlying asset being developed has no alternative use for the Company at contract inception and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for the portion of the performance completed. Service revenues also include laboratory services recognized at point in time. 
We recognize royalty revenues in the period the sales occur using third party evidence. The Company elected the "right to invoice" practical expedient based on the Company's right to invoice a customer at an amount that approximates the value to the customer and the performance completed to date. 
The Company elected the exemption to not disclose the unfulfilled performance obligations for contracts with an original length of one year or less and the exemption to exclude future performance obligations that are accounted under the sales-based or usage-based royalty guidance. The Company’s unfulfilled performance obligations for contracts with an original length greater than one year were not material as of June 30, 2025 and 2024. 
Contracts with customers that contain instruments may include multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, the Company allocates the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis. Allocation of the transaction price is determined at the contracts’ inception. 
Payment terms for shipments to end-users are generally net 30 days. Payment terms for distributor shipments may range from 30 to 90 days. Service arrangements commonly call for payments in advance of performing the work (e.g. extended warranty and service contracts), upon completion of the service (e.g. custom development manufacturing) or a mix of both. 
Contract assets include revenues recognized in advance of billings. Contract assets are included within Other current assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as the amount of time expected to lapse until the Company's right to consideration becomes unconditional is less than one year. We elected the practical expedient allowing us to expense contract costs that would otherwise be capitalized and amortized over a period of less than one year. Contract assets as of June 30, 2025 and 2024 are not material. 
Contract liabilities include billings in excess of revenues recognized, such as those resulting from customer advances and deposits and unearned revenue on warranty contracts. Contract liabilities as of June 30, 2025 and 2024 were approximately $
35.3
 million and $
30.2
 million, respectively. Contract liabilities as of June 30, 2024 subsequently recognized as revenue in fiscal 2025 were approximately $
26.2
 million. Contract liabilities as of June 30, 2023 subsequently recognized as revenue in fiscal 2024 were approximately $
20.9
 million. Contract liabilities in excess of one year are included in Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Table of Contents
Any claims for credit or return of goods must be made within 10 days of receipt. Revenues are reduced to reflect estimated credits and returns. Although the amounts recorded for these revenue deductions are dependent on estimates and assumptions, historically our adjustments to actual results have not been material.
Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in revenue, while the related shipping and handling costs are reflected in cost of products. We elected the practical expedient that allows us to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of a good as a fulfillment cost, and we accrue costs of shipping and handling when the related revenue is recognized. The following tables present our disaggregated revenue for the periods presented.

 Acquisitions:
We periodically complete business combinations that align with our business strategy. Acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date and that the results of operations of each acquired business be included 
64

Table of Contents
in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income from their respective dates of acquisitions. Acquisition costs are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred.
Fiscal year 2025 Acquisitions 
​
There were no acquisitions in fiscal 2025.
​
Fiscal year 2024 Acquisitions 
​
Lunaphore Technologies SA. 
​
On July 7, 2023, the Company acquired all of the ownership interests of Lunaphore Technologies SA (“Lunaphore”) for $
169.7
 million, in a cash-free, debt-free acquisition. Lunaphore is a leading developer of fully automated spatial biology solutions. The Lunaphore acquisition adds spatial biology instruments to Bio-Techne’s portfolio to accelerate our leadership position in translational and clinical research markets. The transaction was accounted for in accordance with 
ASC 805, Business Combinations
. The goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition represents the strategic benefits of growing the Company’s product portfolio and the expected revenue growth from increased market penetration. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The business became part of the Diagnostics and Spatial Biology operating segment in the first quarter of fiscal 2024
. 
​
The allocation of purchase price consideration related to Lunaphore was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Net sales and operating loss of this business included in the Company's consolidated results of operations for fiscal 2024 were approximately $
14.3
 million and $
24.0
 million, respectively.

Tangible assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at fair value on the date of close based on management's assessment. The purchase price allocated to developed technology and customer relationships was based on management’s forecasted cash inflows and outflows and using a multiperiod excess earnings method to calculate the fair value of assets purchased. The purchase price allocated to trade names was based on management's forecasted cash inflows and outflows and using a relief from royalty method. The amount recorded for developed technology is being amortized with the expense reflected in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The amortization period for developed technology is estimated to be 
14 years
. Amortization expense related to customer relationships is reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The amortization period for customer relationships is estimated to be 
8 years
. The amount recorded for trade names is being amortized with the expense reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The amortization period for trade names ranges from 
4 years
 to 
8 years
. The net deferred income tax liability represents the net amount of the estimated future impact of adjustments for costs to be

Tangible assets and liabilities acquired were recorded at fair value on the date of close based on management's assessment. The purchase price allocated to developed technology was based on management’s forecasted cash inflows and outflows and using a relief from royalty method to calculate the fair value of assets purchased. The purchase price allocated to customer relationships and trade names was based on management's forecasted cash inflows and outflows and using a multiperiod excess earnings method. The amount recorded for developed technology is being amortized with the expense reflected in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The amortization period for developed technology is estimated to be 
13 years
. Amortization expense related to customer relationships is reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The amortization period for customer relationships is estimated to be 
4 years
. The amount recorded for trade names and the non-competition agreement is being amortized with the expense reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income. The amortization period for both trade names and the non-competition agreement is estimated to be 
3 years
. The net deferred income tax liability represents the

 Fair Value Measurements:
The Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, available for sale investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, contingent consideration obligations, derivative instruments, and long-term debt.
Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. This standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value. This standard maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability based upon the best information available in the circumstances.
The categorization of financial assets and liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability and their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. Level 3 may also include certain investment securities for which there is limited market activity or a decrease in the observability of market pricing for the investments, such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.
The following tables provide information by level for financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):

Fair value measurements of available for sale securities
Available for sale securities are measured at fair value using quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and are therefore classified as Level 1 assets. 
Fair value measurements of derivative instruments
The Company utilizes forward starting swaps designated as a cash flow hedge on forecasted debt. The forward starting swaps reduce the variability of cash flow payments for the Company by converting the variable interest rate on the Company’s forecasted variable interest long-term debt to that of a fixed interest rate. Accordingly, as part of the forward starting swaps, the Company exchanges, at specified intervals, the difference between floating and fixed interest amounts based on a notional principal amount. The Company also uses a cross-currency swap contract to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk associated with the Company’s net investment in its Swiss subsidiary.
The following table presents the contractual amounts of the Company’s outstanding instruments (in millions):

In May 2021, the Company entered into a forward starting swap designated as a cash flow hedge on forecasted debt based on 
$
200
 million of notional principal. The effective date of the swap was November 2022 with the full swap maturing in November 2025.
(2)
In July 2023, the Company entered into a pay-fixed rate, receive-fixed rate cross-currency swap contract with a total notional amount of 
$
150
 million that was designated as a hedge to lock in the Swiss franc (CHF) rate for a portion of the Company’s CHF net investment in its Lunaphore subsidiary in Switzerland. The objective of the hedge is to protect the net investment in the Company’s CHF-denominated operations against changes in the spot exchange rates, on a pre-tax basis. The hedging instrument has 
four
 interim settlement dates, which will reduce the notional on the hedging instrument by 
$
10
 million at each interim date, and will reduce the notional to 
$
110
 million at maturity.

Gains or losses related to the net investment hedges are classified as foreign currency translation adjustments in the schedule of changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”) in Note 8, as these items are attributable to the Company’s hedges of its net investment in foreign operations. Gains or losses related to the cash flow hedges are classified as Unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges in the schedule of changes in AOCI in Note 8.
The instruments were valued using observable market inputs in active markets and therefore are classified as Level 2 liabilities.
Fair value measurements of contingent consideration
As of December 31 2023
,
 the Company's obligation for potential contingent consideration payments related to the Namocell and Asuragen acquisitions was relieved as the likelihood that the revenue thresholds and product milestones would be achieved in the timeframe established within the purchase agreement was remote. As a result, the Company reversed an accrual for the fair value of the contingent liabilities at the date of settlement during fiscal 2024, respectively. There was no contingent consideration throughout all of fiscal 2025.
The following table presents a reconciliation of the liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in thousands):

The use of different assumptions, applying different judgment to matters that inherently are subjective and changes in future market conditions could result in different estimates of fair value of our securities or contingent consideration, currently and in the future. If market conditions deteriorate, we may incur impairment charges for securities in our investment portfolio.
Fair value measurements of other financial instruments 
– The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, accounts receivable, and accounts payable – The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items.
Long-term debt – The carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the amount drawn on our line-of-credit facility and long-term debt approximates fair value because our interest rate is variable and reflects current market rates.
​
Note

. Debt and Other Financing Arrangements:
On August 31, 2022, the Company entered into a revolving line-of-credit and term loan by a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of $
1
 billion, which can be increased by an additional $
400
 million subject to certain conditions. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and expenditures of the Company and its subsidiaries, including financing permitted acquisitions. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable rate. The current outstanding debt is based on the one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is determined from the total leverage ratio of the Company and updated on a quarterly basis. The annualized fee for any unused portion of the credit facility is currently 
10
 basis points. 
The Credit Agreement matures on August 31, 2027 and contains customary restrictive and financial covenants and customary events of default. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the outstanding balance under the Credit Agreement was $
346.0
 million and $
319.0
 million, respectively.
Note 7. Leases:
As a lessee, the Company leases offices, labs, and manufacturing facilities, as well as vehicles, copiers, and other equipment. The Company determines whether a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception date. Upon commencement date, operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to calculate present value is the Company’s incremental borrowing rate or, if available, the rate implicit in the lease. The Company determines the incremental borrowing rate for each lease based primarily on its lease term and the economic environment of the applicable country or region. The Company recognizes operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Further, as part of our adoption of 
ASC 842
, the Company also made the accounting policy elections to not capitalize short term leases (defined as a lease with a lease term that is less than 12 months) and to combine lease and non-lease components for all asset classes in determining the lease payments.

Basic net income per common share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares of our stock result from dilutive common stock options and restricted stock units. We use the treasury stock method to calculate the weighted-average shares used in the diluted earnings per share computation. Under the treasury stock method, the proceeds from exercise of an option, the amount of compensation cost, if any, for future service that we have not yet recognized, and the amount of estimated tax benefits that would be recorded in paid-in capital, if any, when the option is exercised are assumed to be used to repurchase shares in the current period.
The dilutive effect of stock options in the above table excludes all options for which the aggregate exercise proceeds exceeded the average market price for the period. The number of potentially dilutive option shares excluded from the calculation was 
3.8
 million, 
3.9
 million, and 
4.5
 million for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Note

Share-based Compensation and Other Benefit Plans:
The cost of employee services received in exchange for the award of equity instruments is based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant. Compensation cost is recognized using a straight-line method over the vesting period and is net of estimated forfeitures. Stock option exercises and stock awards are satisfied through the issuance of new shares.
Equity incentive plan:
 The 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, which replaced the Company’s Second Amended and Restated 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (collectively, the Plans), provides for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units and stock appreciation rights. There were 
36.2
 million shares of common stock authorized for grant under the Plans. The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock reserved and available for awards under the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan is 
9,936,808
 shares. At June 30, 2025, there were 
6.8
 million shares of common stock available for grant under the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan. The maximum term of incentive options granted under the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan is 
ten years
. The Plans are administered 
74

Table of Contents
by the Board of Directors and its Executive Compensation Committee, which determine the persons who are to receive awards under the Plans, the number of shares subject to each award and the term and exercise price of each award. The number of shares of common stock subject to outstanding awards as of June 30, 2025 under the Plans were 
9.5
 million.
The fair values of options granted under the Plans were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions used:

The dividend yield is based on the Company’s historical annual cash dividend divided by the market value of the Company’s common stock. The expected annualized volatility is based on the Company’s historical stock price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the option granted. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rates with a term consistent with the expected life of the options granted.

A deferred tax valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance as of June 30, 2025 was $
33.8
 million compared to $
19.3
 million in the prior year.
As of June 30, 2025, we had a $
33.8
 million valuation allowance, of which $
13.1
 million is from outside basis differences, with the remainder relating to certain foreign and state tax net operating loss and state credit carryforwards. The Company believes it is more likely than not that these tax carryovers will not be realized.
As of June 30, 2025, the Company has federal operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
15.4
 million and state operating loss carryforwards of $
127.2
 million from its previous acquisitions, which are not limited under IRC Section 382. As of June 30, 2025, the Company has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $
116.3
 million. Some of the net operating loss carryforwards expire between fiscal 2026 and 2036. Federal net operating loss carryforwards generated after December 31, 2017 have an indefinite carryforward period but the Company expects to be fully utilize these attributes by June 30, 2032. The Company has a deferred tax asset of $
10.5
 million, net of the valuation allowance discussed above, related to the net operating loss carryovers. As of June 30, 2025, the Company has federal and state tax credit carryforwards of $
4.9
 million and $
4.8
 million, respectively. The federal tax credit carryforwards expire between 2028 and 2040. The majority of the state credit carryforwards have no expiry date. The state credit carryforwards that have expiry dates have a full valuation allowance. The Company has a deferred tax asset of $
5.1
 million, net of the valuation allowance discussed above, related to the tax credit carryovers.
As of June 30, 2025, the Company has approximately $
179
 million of undistributed earnings in its foreign subsidiaries. Approximately $
73
 million of these earnings are no longer considered permanently reinvested and the Company expects to be able to repatriate earnings on a tax neutral basis. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on approximately $
106
 million of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries as of June 30, 2025 which are indefinitely reinvested in operations. Because of the multiple entities as well as the complexities of laws and regulations by which to repatriate the earnings to minimize tax cost, it is not practical to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely. A deferred tax liability will be recognized if the Company can no longer demonstrate that it plans to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings.

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal 2025 are potential benefits of $
3.3
 million that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in its provision for income taxes. The Company had $
0.2
 million of accrued interest and penalties as of June 30, 2025. The amount recorded for the periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, was $
0.6
 million and $
0.5
 million, respectively, in accrued interest and penalties. The Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase in the next twelve months. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and certain state tax jurisdictions, and several jurisdictions outside the U.S. The Company’s federal returns are subject to tax assessment for 2020 and subsequent years. State and foreign income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to five years after filing of the respective return. The state impact of any federal changes remains subject to examination by various states for a period of up to one year after formal notification to the states.

 Segment Information:
The Company operates under 
two
 operating segments, Protein Sciences and Diagnostics and Spatial Biology.
The Company’s Protein Sciences segment is comprised of the reagent solutions division and analytical solutions division. Our Protein Sciences segment is a leading developer and manufacturer of high-quality biological reagents used in all aspects of life science research, diagnostics and cell and gene therapy. This segment also includes proteomic analytical tools, both manual and automated, that offer researchers and pharmaceutical manufacturers efficient and streamlined options for automated western blot and multiplexed ELISA workflow. No customer in the Protein Sciences segment accounted for more than 10% of the segment’s net sales for fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023.
The Company’s Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment is comprised of the diagnostics reagents division, spatial biology divsion, and molecular diagnostics division. Our Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment develops and manufactures diagnostic products, including controls, calibrators, and diagnostic assays for the regulated diagnostics market, exosome-based molecular diagnostic assays, advanced tissue-based in-situ hybridization assays for spatial genomic and tissue biopsy analysis, and genetic and oncology kits for research and clinical applications. No customer in the Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment accounted for more than 10% of the segment’s net sales for fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023.
There are no concentrations of business transacted with a particular customer or supplier or concentrations of revenue from a particular product or geographic area that would severely impact the Company in the near term.
The Company discloses segment operating income as its measure of segment profit, reconciled to both total operating income and income before taxes. Business segment operating income excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (described below as unallocated amounts). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to the Company’s chief operating decision maker (CODM). For the Company, the CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM uses segment operating income to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic reviews of results and overall market activity.

The Company has some integrated facilities that serve both segments. As such, asset and capital expenditure information by operating segment has not been provided and is not available, since the Company does not produce or utilize such information internally. In addition, although depreciation and amortization expense is a component of each operating segment’s operating results, it is not discretely identifiable.
The Company has disclosed sales by geographic area based on the location of the customer or distributor in Note 2. The Company has disclosed dis-aggregated product and service revenue by consumables, instruments, and services in Note 2. The Company considers total instrument and total service revenue to represent similar groups of products in the fiscal years presented. The Company considers our consumables sold in the Protein Sciences and Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segments to represent different groups of products and therefore have separately disclosed the related consumables revenue (in thousands):

 Restructurings:
Fiscal 2025 Restructuring Actions:
During the fourth quarter, management engaged in a series of restructuring activities to optimize components of our global manufacturing processes. These activities included adjusting manufacturing locations and protocols of certain products to better align with geographical and customer demand. Associated with these manufacturing changes, the Company incurred asset impairments of $
11.5
 million. Additionally, the Company pursued strategic divestiture of the Exosome Diagnostics business. The Company is expecting to incur costs related to these actions through fiscal 2026, which will be recorded when specified criteria are met. 
As part of these actions, certain assets and liabilities associated with a disposal group in our Diagnostics and Spatial Biology segment were classified as held-for-sale as of May 31, 2025, including $
4.5
 million of goodwill allocated to the disposal group on a relative fair value basis. As a result of an impairment test performed over the disposal group during fiscal 2025, a cumulative impairment charge of $
83.1
 million which 
includes
 the allocated goodwill, was recorded in the Selling, general and administrative line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income for fiscal 2025.

Fiscal 2024 Restructuring Actions:
In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company announced enterprise-wide restructuring focused on recovering operating margins, optimizing our distribution footprint, and enhancing our organization efficiency. These actions impacted approximately 
4
% of our global workforce. These actions continued through the end of fiscal 2025 as we incurred charges relating to the condensing of certain distribution centers and optimizing efficiency. 
As part of these actions, certain assets and liabilities associated with a disposal group in our Protein Sciences segment were classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2023, including $
1.4
 million of goodwill allocated to the disposal group on a relative fair value basis. As a result of an impairment test performed over the disposal group during fiscal 2024, a cumulative impairment charge of $
22.0
 million which includes the allocated goodwill, was recorded in the Selling, general and administrative line in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Income for fiscal 2024. There was a recovery related to the disposal group during fiscal 2025 of $
2.6
 million. During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with a buyer to purchase the remaining inventory for approximately $
8
 million. As part of the arrangement, the Company and the buyer entered into a promissory note that will mature in February 2027 and agrees that the buyer shall pay in quarterly installments. As of June 30, 2025, the fair value of the note receivable was approximately $
5.3
 million and is included within Other current assets and Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of June 30, 2025, the assets remaining within the disposal group primarily include the land and building of $
4.7
 million, which is net of expected selling costs. These assets are actively marketed at a fair value based on market conditions such that the held-for-sale criterion are still met. The held-for-sale assets are recorded in Current assets held-for-sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2025 and 2024.

​
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
​
As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). The evaluation was based upon reports and certifications provided by a number of executives. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2025, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
(b)
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting also includes those policies and procedures that:
(i)
Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
(ii)
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
(iii)
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Under the supervision of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our assessment and those criteria, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2025.
The attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting issued by KPMG LLP appears in Item 8 of this report.
(c)
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during fiscal 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
