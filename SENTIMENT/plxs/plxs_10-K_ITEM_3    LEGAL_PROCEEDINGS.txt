Shareholders of Record
As of November 11, 2024, we had 325 shareholders of record. 
Dividends
We have not paid any cash dividends in the past. We currently anticipate that in the foreseeable future the majority of earnings will be retained to finance the development of our business through capital expenditures and working capital requirements, as well as execution upon our share repurchase authorizations as management deems appropriate and market conditions may allow. However, our Board of Directors evaluates from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include additional share repurchases, a special dividend or recurring dividends. See also Part II, Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources," for additional discussion of our intentions regarding dividends as well as a description of loan covenants that could restrict our ability to make future dividend payments.

ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries (together "Plexus," the "Company," or "we") help create the products that build a better world. Driven by a passion for excellence, we partner with our customers to design, manufacture and service highly complex products in demanding regulatory environments. Our innovative solutions across the lifecycle of a product converge where advanced technology and human impact intersect. We provide these solutions to market-leading as well as disruptive global companies in the Aerospace/Defense, Healthcare/Life Sciences, and Industrial market sectors supported by a global team of over 20,000 members across our 26 facilities in the Americas ("AMER"), Asia-Pacific ("APAC") and Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") regions. 
The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is intended to provide an analysis of both short-term results and future prospects from management’s perspective, including an assessment of the financial condition and results of operations, events and uncertainties that are not indicative of future operations and any other financial or statistical data that we believe will enhance the understanding of our company’s financial condition, cash flows and other changes in financial condition and results of operations. The information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein and "Risk Factors" included in Part I, Item 1A herein.
A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 is presented below. A discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 is incorporated herein by reference from Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," in our Annual Report on the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on November 17, 2023, and is available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov as well as our Investor Relations website at www.plexus.com.
Market Pressures Update
We have experienced market-driven inventory corrections and incrementally weaker demand from our customers in our Healthcare/Lifesciences and Industrial market sectors. While we are starting to see improvements, if market softness continues for extended periods, this would impact our operating results in future periods.
We believe our balance sheet is positioned to support the potential future challenges presented by the macroeconomic pressures we are facing. As of September 28, 2024, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were $347 million, while debt, finance lease and other financing obligations were $247 million. Borrowings under our credit facility as of September 28, 2024 were $50 million, leaving $450 million of our revolving commitment of $500 million available for use as of September 28, 2024 as well as the ability to expand our revolving commitment to $750 million upon mutual agreement with our banks. Interest expense could increase above current levels due to increased borrowing under our credit facility associated with working capital investments along with the impact of rising interest rates. Refer to Note 4, "Debt, Finance Lease and Other Financing Obligations," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources" in Part II, Item 7 for further information.

Net sales.
 Fiscal 2024 net sales decreased $249.5 million, or 5.9%, as compared to fiscal 2023. 
Net sales are analyzed by management by geographic segment, which reflects our reportable segments, and by market sector. Management measures operational performance and allocates resources on a geographic segment basis. Our global business development strategy is based on our targeted market sectors. 
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, net sales attributable to customers representing 10.0% or more of consolidated net sales as well as the percentage of net sales attributable to our ten largest customers for the indicated fiscal years were as follows:

AMER. 
Net sales for fiscal 2024 in the AMER segment decreased $234.8 million, or 15.1%, as compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease in net sales was driven by overall net decreased customer end-market demand, inclusive of market-driven inventory corrections at our customers, as well as reductions in inflated component pricing. The decrease was further driven by a decrease of $38.7 million due to disengagements with customers and $35.9 million due to the discontinuation of programs with existing customers. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $68.8 million due to production ramps of new products for existing customers and $41.4 million due to production ramps for new customers.

APAC. 
Net sales for fiscal 2024 in the APAC segment decreased $145.3 million, or 6.2%, as compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease in net sales was driven by overall net decreased customer end-market demand, inclusive of market-driven inventory corrections at our customers, as well as reductions in inflated component pricing. The decrease was further driven by a decrease of $32.5 million for end-of-life products and $8.5 million due to a disengagement with a customer. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $20.0 million due to production ramps of new products for existing customers.
EMEA. 
Net sales for fiscal 2024 in the EMEA segment increased $138.6 million, or 34.4%, as compared to fiscal 2023. The increase in net sales was driven by an increase of $89.3 million due to production ramps for new customers, $22.6 million due to production ramps of new products for existing customers and overall net increased customer end-market demand. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $10.4 million due to the discontinuation of a program with an existing customer and reductions in inflated component pricing.

The increase was driven by overall net increased customer end-market demand, an increase of $32.9 million in production ramps for new customers and $19.7 million in production ramps of new products for existing customers. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $20.7 million due to disengagements with customers.
Healthcare/Life Sciences
.
 Net sales for fiscal 2024 in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector decreased $320.0 million, or 17.1%, as compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease in net sales was driven by overall net decreased customer end-market demand, inclusive of market-driven inventory corrections at our customers, as well as a reduction in inflated component pricing. The decrease was further driven by a decrease of $31.9 million for end-of-life products. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $87.4 million in production ramps of new products for existing customers and $14.3 million in production ramps for new customers.
Industrial.
 Net sales for fiscal 2024 in the Industrial sector decreased $49.0 million, or 2.8%, as compared to fiscal 2023. The decrease in net sales was driven by overall net decreased customer end-market demand as well as a reductions in inflated component pricing.  The decrease was further driven by a decrease of $45.9 million due to the discontinuation of programs with existing customers and $24.1 million due to disengagements with customers. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $83.3 million in production ramps for a new customer.
Cost of sales. 
Cost of sales for fiscal 2024 decreased $233.5 million, or 6.1%, as compared to fiscal 2023. Cost of sales is comprised primarily of material and component costs, labor costs and overhead. In both fiscal 2024 and 2023, approximately 89% of the total cost of sales was variable in nature and fluctuated with sales volumes. Approximately 87% of these costs in both fiscal 2024 and 2023 were related to material and component costs. 
As compared to fiscal 2023, the decrease in cost of sales in fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by the decrease in net sales and a positive shift in customer mix, partially offset by an increase in fixed costs.
Gross profit.
 Gross profit for fiscal 2024 decreased $16.1 million, or 4.1%, as compared to fiscal 2023. Gross margin of 9.6% increased 20 basis points compared to fiscal 2023. The primary drivers of the decrease in gross profit as compared to fiscal 2023 were a decrease in net sales and an increase in fixed costs to support new customer program ramps, partially offset by a positive shift in customer mix, which drove the increase in gross margin. 
Operating income.
 Operating income for fiscal 2024 decreased $28.1 million, or 14.4%, as compared to fiscal 2023. Operating margin of 4.2% decreased 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2023. The primary drivers of the decrease in operating income and operating margin as compared to fiscal 2023 was the result of the decrease in gross profit and an increase of $14.9 million in S&A, partially offset by a decrease of $2.8 million in restructuring and other charges. The increase in S&A was primarily due to an increase of $9.0 million in stock-based compensation expense primarily due to $5.1 million of accelerated stock-based compensation expense related to executive retirement agreements. The increase in S&A was further driven by a net increase in compensation costs and an increase in information technology and professional service expenses. The restructuring and other charges for fiscal 2024 consisted of employee severance costs associated with a reduction in the Company's workforce as well

as closure costs associated with sites in the Company's AMER and EMEA regions, offset by insurance proceeds received in an arbitration decision regarding a contractual matter that took place in the Company's EMEA region in fiscal 2023. The restructuring and other charges for fiscal 2023 consisted of severance from the reduction of the Company's workforce, a lease agreement termination and an arbitration decision regarding a contractual matter that occurred in the Company's EMEA region.

Operating income decreased $40.1 million in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily as a result of a decrease in net sales and an increase in S&A, partially offset by a positive shift in customer mix and a decrease in fixed costs.
APAC. 
Operating income decreased $0.3 million in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023, primarily as a result of a decrease in net sales, partially offset by a positive shift in customer mix.
EMEA. 
Operating income increased $11.8 million in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023 primarily as a result of an increase in net sales and a positive shift in customer mix, partially offset by increased fixed costs and an increase in S&A.
Other expense.
 Other expense for fiscal 2024 increased $3.4 million as compared to fiscal 2023. The increase in other expense for fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by a decrease in other miscellaneous income of $4.9 million as prior year insurance recoveries did not recur and an increase in foreign exchange losses of $1.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $2.7 million due to lower borrowings on our credit facility. 
Income taxes.
 Income tax expense for fiscal 2024 was $17.7 million compared to $21.9 million for fiscal 2023. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax book income and the geographic distribution of worldwide earnings.
Our annual effective tax rate varies from the U.S. statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to the geographic distribution of worldwide earnings as well as a tax holiday granted to a subsidiary located in the APAC segment where we derive a significant portion of our earnings. Our effective tax rate may also be impacted by disputes with taxing authorities, tax planning activities, adjustments to uncertain tax positions and changes in valuation allowances.
We have been granted a tax holiday for a foreign subsidiary operating in the APAC segment. This tax holiday will expire on December 31, 2034, and is subject to certain conditions. In fiscal 2024 and 2023, the holiday resulted in tax reductions, net of the impact of the GILTI provisions of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, of approximately $37.3 million ($1.36 per basic share, $1.34 per diluted share) and $25.9 million ($0.94 per basic share, $0.92 per diluted share), respectively.
See also Note 6, "Income Taxes," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our tax rate.
The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 is expected to be approximately 14.0% to 16.0%.
Net income.
 Net income for fiscal 2024 decreased $27.3 million, or 19.6%, from fiscal 2023 to $111.8 million. Net income decreased primarily as a result of the decrease in operating income and the increase in other expense, partially offset by the decrease in tax expense as previously discussed.
Diluted earnings per share.
 Diluted earnings per share decreased to $4.01 in fiscal 2024 from $4.95 in fiscal 2023, primarily as a result of decreased net income due to the factors discussed above, partially offset by a reduction in diluted shares outstanding.
Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") and economic return.
 We use a financial model that is aligned with our business strategy and includes an ROIC goal of 15% which would exceed our weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") by more than 500 basis points and represent positive economic return. Economic return is the amount our ROIC exceeds our WACC.
31
Table of Contents
Non-GAAP financial measures, including ROIC and economic return, are used for internal management goals and decision making because such measures provide management and investors additional insight into financial performance. In particular, we provide ROIC and economic return because we believe they offer insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions. We view ROIC and economic return as important measures in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital investments. We also use ROIC as a performance criteria in determining certain elements of compensation as well as economic return performance.
We define ROIC as tax-effected operating income before restructuring and other charges divided by average invested capital over a rolling five-quarter period for the fiscal year. Invested capital is defined as equity plus debt and operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents. Other companies may not define or calculate ROIC in the same way. ROIC and other non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP").
We review our internal calculation of WACC annually. Our WACC was 8.2% for fiscal 2024 and 9.0% for fiscal 2023. By exercising discipline to generate ROIC in excess of our WACC, our goal is to create value for our shareholders. Fiscal 2024 ROIC of 11.8% reflects an economic return of 3.6%, based on our weighted average cost of capital of 8.2%, and fiscal 2023 ROIC of 13.4% reflects an economic return of 4.4%, based on our weighted average cost of capital of 9.0%.
For a reconciliation of ROIC, economic return and adjusted operating income (tax-effected) to our financial statements that were prepared using U.S. GAAP, see Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were $347.5 million as of September 28, 2024, as compared to $256.7 million as of September 30, 2023. 
As of September 28, 2024, 88% of our cash and cash equivalents balance was held outside of the U.S. by our foreign subsidiaries. Currently, we believe that our cash balance, together with cash available under our Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs and potential share repurchases, if any, for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future.
Our future cash flows from operating activities will be reduced by $31.4 million due to cash payments for U.S. federal taxes on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings that are payable over an eight year period that began in fiscal 2019 with the first payment. The table below provides the expected timing of these future cash outflows, in accordance with the following installment schedule for the remaining two years (in millions):

Operating Activities.
 Cash flows provided by operating activities were $436.5 million for fiscal 2024, as compared to $165.8 million for fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily due to cash flow improvements (reductions) of:
•
$(27.3) million decrease in net income. 
•
$213.7 million in inventory cash flows driven by a larger decrease in inventory in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023 due to inventory reduction efforts.
•
$139.9 million in accounts payables cash flows primarily driven by the timing of materials procurement and payments to suppliers.
•
$24.8 million in contract assets cash flows driven by lower demand from over time customers.
•
$(34.1) million in advanced payments from customers cash flows driven by a larger decrease in advanced payments in fiscal 2024 as compared to fiscal 2023. 
•
$(36.5) million in accounts receivable cash flows driven by timing of shipments and mix of customer payment terms.
•
$(23.6) million in other current and non-current asset cash flows primarily driven by an increase in tax prepayments related to timing of payments and an increase in prepayments to suppliers in fiscal 2024 as compared to a decrease in fiscal 2023.

We calculate days in accounts receivable and contract assets as each balance sheet item for the respective quarter divided by annualized sales for the respective quarter by day. We calculate days in inventory, accounts payable and advanced payments as each balance sheet line item for the respective quarter divided by annualized cost of sales for the respective quarter by day. We calculate annualized cash cycle as the sum of days in accounts receivable, days in contract assets and days in inventory, less days in accounts payable and days in advanced payments.  
As of September 28, 2024, annualized cash cycle days decreased twenty-three days compared to September 30, 2023 due to the following:
Days in accounts receivable for the three months ended September 28, 2024 decreased five days compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to the timing of customer shipments and payments as well as the mix of customer payment terms.
Days in contract assets for the three months ended September 28, 2024 decreased three days compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in demand from customers with arrangements requiring revenue to be recognized over time as products are produced.
Days in inventory for the three months ended September 28, 2024 decreased twenty-seven days compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to inventory reduction efforts.
Days in accounts payable for the three months ended September 28, 2024 decreased five days compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to timing of materials procurement and payments to suppliers.
Days in advanced payments for the three months ended September 28, 2024 decreased seven days compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a return of advanced payments to customers in line with lower inventory balances.
Free Cash Flow. 
We define free cash flow ("FCF"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as cash flow provided by operations less capital expenditures. FCF was $341.3 million for fiscal 2024 compared to $61.8 million for fiscal 2023, an increase of $279.5 million. The improvement in FCF was primarily due to inventory reduction efforts as well as lower working capital investments in inventory to support our customers.
Non-GAAP financial measures, including FCF, are used for internal management assessments because such measures provide additional insight to investors into ongoing financial performance. In particular, we provide FCF because we believe it offers insight into the metrics that are driving management decisions. We view FCF as an important financial metric as it demonstrates our ability to generate cash and can allow us to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value. FCF is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, measures of our financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Investing Activities.
 Cash flows used in investing activities were $94.9 million for fiscal 2024 compared to $93.3 million for fiscal 2023. The increase in cash used in investing activities was due to $10.8 million from insurance proceeds in fiscal 2023, partially offset by an $8.9 million decrease in capital expenditures.
We utilized available cash and financing cash flows as the sources for funding our operating requirements during fiscal 2024. We currently estimate capital expenditures for fiscal 2025 will be approximately $120.0 million to $150.0 million to support new program ramps and replace older equipment. This estimate also includes $60.0 million related to the footprint expansion on the mainland of Penang, Malaysia.
Financing Activities.

Cash flows used in financing activities were $255.6 million for fiscal 2024 compared to $92.7 million for fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to net repayments on the credit facility in fiscal 2024 of $183.0 million compared to net repayments on the credit facility in 2023 of $30.0 million as well as an increase of $14.7 million in cash used to repurchase our common stock.
On August 18, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock (the "2023 Program"). During fiscal 2024 and 2023, we completed the 2023 Program by repurchasing 59,277 and 425,746 shares under this program for $5.7 million and $40.9 million at an average price of $95.59 and $95.96 per share, respectively. 
On January 16, 2024, the Company announced a share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors under which we were authorized to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock (the "2024 Program"). The 2024 Program commenced upon completion of the 2023 Program. During fiscal 2024, we completed the 2024 Program by repurchasing 477,012 shares under this program for $50.0 million at an average price of $104.82 per share. 
On August 14, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock (the "2025 Program"). The 2025 Program commenced upon completion of the 2024 Program, and has no expiration. During fiscal 2024, we purchased 151 shares under this program for less than $0.1 million at an average price of $131.78 per share. As of September 28, 2024, $49.9 million of authority remained under the 2025 Program. 
All shares repurchased under the aforementioned programs were recorded as treasury stock.
On June 15, 2018, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “2018 NPA”) pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of $150.0 million in principal amount of unsecured senior notes, consisting of $100.0 million in principal amount 4.05% Series A Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2025, and $50.0 million in principal amount of 4.22% Series B Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2028 (collectively, the “2018 Notes”), in a private placement. The 2018 NPA includes customary operational and financial covenants with which we are required to comply, including, among others, maintenance of certain financial ratios such as a total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The 2018 Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, subject to payment of a make-whole amount; interest on the 2018 Notes is payable semiannually. As of September 28, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants under the 2018 NPA.
On June 9, 2022, we refinanced our then-existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility (as amended by that certain Amendment No. 1 to Credit Agreement dated April 29, 2020, the "Prior Credit Facility") by entering into a new 5-year revolving credit facility (collectively with the Prior Credit Facility, referred to as the "Credit Facility"), which expanded the maximum commitment from $350.0 million to $500.0 million and extended the maturity from May 15, 2024 to June 9, 2027. The maximum commitment under the Credit Facility may be further increased to $750.0 million, generally by mutual agreement of the lenders and us, subject to certain customary conditions. During fiscal 2024, the highest daily borrowing was $376.0 million; the average daily balance was $257.8 million. We borrowed $550.5 million and repaid $733.5 million of revolving borrowings ("revolving commitment") under the Credit Facility during fiscal 2024. As of September 28, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants relating to the Credit Facility, which are generally consistent with those in the 2018 NPA discussed above. We are required to pay a commitment fee on the daily unused credit facility based on our leverage ratio; the fee was 0.100% as of September 28, 2024.

The Credit Facility and the 2018 NPA allow for the future payment of cash dividends or the repurchase of shares provided that no event of default (including any failure to comply with a financial covenant) exists at the time of, or would be caused by, the dividend payment or the share repurchases. We have not paid cash dividends in the past. However, we evaluate from time to time potential uses of excess cash, which in the future may include share repurchases above those already authorized, a special dividend or recurring dividends.
We have Master Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreements with MUFG Bank, New York Branch (formerly known as The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.) (the "MUFG RPA"), HSBC Bank (China) Company Limited, Xiamen branch (the "HSBC RPA") and other unaffiliated financial institutions, under which we may elect to sell receivables, at a discount. These facilities are uncommitted facilities. The maximum facility amount under the MUFG RPA as of September 28, 2024 is $340.0 million. The maximum facility amount under the HSBC RPA as of September 28, 2024 is $70.0 million. The MUFG RPA will be automatically extended each year unless any party gives no less than 10 days prior notice that the agreement should not be extended. The terms of the HSBC RPA are generally consistent with the terms of the MUFG RPA previously discussed. 
We sold $854.7 million and $834.5 million of trade accounts receivable under these programs during fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, in exchange for cash proceeds of $844.6 million and $824.6 million, respectively. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, $220.2 million and $220.5 million, respectively, of accounts receivables sold under trade accounts receivable programs and subject to servicing by us remained outstanding and had not yet been collected. 
In all cases, the sale discount was recorded within "Miscellaneous, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in the period of the sale. For further information regarding the receivable sale programs, see Note 14, "Trade Accounts Receivable Sale Programs," in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Based on current expectations, we believe that our projected cash flows provided by operations, available cash and cash equivalents, potential borrowings under the Credit Facility and our leasing capabilities should be sufficient to meet our working capital and fixed capital requirements, as well as execution upon our share repurchase authorizations as management deems appropriate, for the next twelve months. We believe our balance sheet is positioned to support the potential future challenges presented by macroeconomic factors including increased working capital requirements associated with longer lead-times for components, increased component and labor costs, and operating inefficiencies due to supply chain constraints. As of the end of fiscal 2024, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were $347 million, while debt, finance lease and other financing obligations were $247 million. If our future financing needs increase, then we may need to arrange additional debt or equity financing. Accordingly, we evaluate and consider from time to time various financing alternatives to supplement our financial resources. However, we cannot be assured that we will be able to make any such arrangements on acceptable terms or at all.

DISCLOSURE ABOUT CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Our accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 "Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. During fiscal 2024 there were no material changes to these policies. Our critical accounting estimates are described below:
Revenue Recognition:
 Revenue is recognized over time for arrangements with customers for which: (i) our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to us, and (ii) we have an enforceable right to payment, including reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date. If either of the two conditions noted above are not met to recognize revenue over time, revenue is recognized following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying arrangement.
For contracts requiring over time revenue recognition, we calculate the revenue to recognize using the costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin. We use historical information to estimate the profit margin associated with the performance obligation that is satisfied over time. We reevaluate our estimate of profit margins on a quarterly basis. While experience has shown that trends in profit margins are not volatile, changes in pricing or cost efficiencies could create significant fluctuations for certain performance obligations. As actual experience becomes available, we use the data to update the historical averages and compare the results to estimates. Based on review of profits margins we update our estimate to the model as necessary. 
See Note 15 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our revenue recognition policies. 
Income Taxes:
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We maintain valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, we take into account such factors as:
•
Prior earnings history
. A pattern of recent financial reporting losses in a jurisdiction is heavily weighted as a source of negative evidence. We also consider the strength and trend of earnings, as well as other relevant factors. In certain circumstances, historical earnings may not be as relevant due to changes in our business operations;
•
Expected future earnings.
 Future reversals of existing temporary differences are heavily weighted sources of objectively verifiable positive evidence.

Projections of future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences are an additional source of positive evidence;
•
Tax planning strategies
. If necessary and available, tax planning strategies would be implemented to accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards. These strategies would be a source of additional positive evidence.
See Note 6 "Income Taxes" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our income tax policies.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates. We selectively use financial instruments to reduce such risks. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. 
Foreign Currency Risk
Our international operations create potential foreign exchange risk. Our policy is to selectively hedge our foreign currency denominated transactions in a manner that partially offsets the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We typically use foreign currency contracts to hedge only those currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Corresponding gains and losses on the underlying transaction generally offset the gains and losses on these foreign currency hedges. We cannot predict changes in currency rates, nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impacts of currency exchange rate changes. Such changes could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our percentages of transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the indicated fiscal years were as follows:

2024
2023
Net Sales
11%
8%
Total Costs
17%
16%
We have evaluated the potential foreign currency exchange rate risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar for the periods presented above. Based on our overall currency exposure, as of September 28, 2024, a 10.0% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to our other transactional currencies would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Interest Rate Risk
We have financial instruments, including cash equivalents and debt, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing market risk. To achieve this, we limit the amount of principal exposure to any one issuer. 
As of September 28, 2024, our only material interest rate risk was associated with our Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at (a)(1) for borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars, the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), (2) for borrowings denominated in pounds sterling, the Daily Simple Risk-Free Rate, plus, in each case of (a)(1) and (2), 10 basis points, (b) for borrowings denominated in euros, the EURIBOR Rate plus a statutory reserve rate, or (c) an Alternate Base Rate equal to the highest of (i) 100 basis points per annum, (ii) the prime rate last quoted by The Wall Street Journal (or, if not quoted, as otherwise provided in the Credit Facility), (iii) the greater of the federal funds effective rate and the overnight bank funding rate in effect on such day plus, in each case, 50 basis points per annum (or, if neither are available, as otherwise provided in the Credit Facility), and (iv) Term SOFR for a one month interest period on such day plus 110 basis points, plus, in each case of (a), (b), and (c), an applicable interest rate margin based on the Company's then current consolidated total indebtedness (minus certain unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in an amount not to exceed $100 million) to consolidated EBITDA. As of September 28, 2024, the borrowing rate under the Credit Facility was SOFR plus 1.00%. Borrowings under the 2018 NPA are based on a fixed interest rate, thus mitigating much of our interest rate risk. Based on our overall interest rate exposure, as of September 28, 2024, a 10.0% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Plexus Corp.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 28, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition
As described in Notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, revenue is recognized over time for arrangements with customers for which: (i) the Company's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Company, and (ii) the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date. Revenue recognized over time is estimated based on costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin. If either of the two conditions are not met to recognize revenue over time, revenue is recognized following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying arrangement. For the year ended September 28, 2024, the Company's net sales were $3.96 billion.
The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures related to the Company's revenue recognition. 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the completeness, accuracy, and occurrence of revenue recognized for a sample of revenue transactions by obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as purchase orders, invoices, proof of shipment, and cash receipts; (ii) confirming a sample of outstanding customer invoice balances as of September 28, 2024, and for confirmations not returned, obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as purchase orders, invoices, proof of shipment, and subsequent cash receipts; (iii) testing the accuracy and timing of revenue recognized as of period end for a sample of arrangements with customers that meet the conditions for over time revenue recognition by obtaining and inspecting source documents, such as master services agreements, purchase orders, inventory balances as of period end, and estimated profit margin support which includes historical results; and (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the data used by management to calculate the revenue recognized over time.

Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies
Description of Business: 
Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries (together "Plexus," the "Company," or "we") help create the products that build a better world. Driven by a passion for excellence, we partner with our customers to design, manufacture and service highly complex products in demanding regulatory environments. Our innovative solutions across the lifecycle of a product converge where advanced technology and human impact intersect. We provide these solutions to market-leading as well as disruptive global companies in the Aerospace/Defense, Healthcare/Life Sciences, and Industrial market sectors supported by a global team of over 
20,000
 members across our 
26
 facilities in the Americas ("AMER"), Asia-Pacific ("APAC") and Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") regions. 
Significant Accounting Policies
Consolidation Principles and Basis of Presentation:
 The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") and include the accounts of Plexus Corp. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. 
The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30. The Company also uses a "4-4-5" weekly accounting system for the interim periods in each quarter. Each quarter, therefore, ends on a Saturday at the end of the 4-4-5 period. Periodically, an additional week must be added to the fiscal year to re-align with the Saturday closest to September 30. Fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 each included 52 weeks.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. The full extent to which current global events and economic conditions will impact the Company's business and operating results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. The Company has considered information available as of the date of issuance of these financial statements and is not aware of any specific events or circumstances that would require an update to its estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of its assets or liabilities. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information becomes available. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash:
 Cash equivalents include short-term highly liquid investments and are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy described below. Cash equivalents of $
60.9
 million and $
33.5
 million at September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, consisted primarily of time deposits with initial maturities of less than three months. Restricted cash represents cash received from customers to settle invoices sold under accounts receivable purchase agreements that the Company continues servicing and is contractually required to be set aside. The restrictions will lapse when the cash is remitted to the purchaser of the receivables. Restricted cash is also classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy described below.
Inventories:

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method. Valuing inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value requires the use of estimates and judgment. Customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons that are beyond the Company’s control. Any of these, or certain additional actions, could impact the valuation of inventory. Any actions taken by the Company’s customers that could impact the value of its inventory are considered when determining the lower of cost or net realizable value. 
In certain instances, in accordance with contractual terms, the Company receives advanced payments from customers to offset inventory risks.
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation:
 Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. 
Estimated useful lives for major classes of depreciable assets are generally as follows:

Buildings and improvements
5
-
39
 years
Machinery and equipment
3
-
7
 years
Computer hardware and software
3
-
10
 years
47
Table of Contents
Plexus Corp.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Certain facilities and equipment held under finance leases are classified as property, plant and equipment and amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the lease and the related obligations are recorded as liabilities. Amortization of assets held under finance leases is included in depreciation expense (see Note 3, "Property, Plant and Equipment") and the financing component of the lease payments is classified as interest expense. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. 
The Company capitalizes significant costs incurred in the acquisition or development of software for internal use. This includes costs of the software, consulting services and compensation costs for employees directly involved in developing internal use computer software.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: 
Long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment and written down to fair value when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups may not be recoverable through estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If an impairment has occurred, a write-down to estimated fair value is made and the impairment loss is recognized as a charge against current operations. The impairment analysis is based on management’s assumptions, including future revenue and cash flow projections. Circumstances that may lead to impairment of property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets and intangible assets with finite lives include reduced expectations for future performance or industry demand and possible further restructurings, among others.
Revenue Recognition:
 Revenue is recognized over time for arrangements with customers for which: (i) the Company's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Company, and (ii) the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date. Revenue recognized over time is estimated based on costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin. If either of the two conditions noted above are not met to recognize revenue over time, revenue is recognized following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying arrangement.
The Company recognizes revenue when a contract exists and when, or as, it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a customer. Contracts are accounted for when they have approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer.
The Company generally enters into a master services arrangement that establishes the framework under which business will be conducted. These arrangements represent the master terms and conditions of the Company's services that apply to individual orders, but they do not commit the customer to work with, or to continue to work with, the Company nor do they obligate the customer to any specific volume or pricing of purchases. Moreover, these terms can be amended in appropriate situations. Customer purchase orders are received for specific quantities with predominantly fixed pricing and delivery requirements. Thus, for the majority of our contracts, there is no guarantee of any revenue to the Company until a customer submits a purchase order. As a result, the Company generally considers its arrangement with a customer to be the combination of the master services arrangement and the purchase order. Most of the Company's arrangements with customers create a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual manufactured product or service is capable of being distinct.
The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time. A performance obligation is satisfied over time if the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin. Determining if an enforceable right to payment includes a reasonable profit margin requires judgment and is assessed on a contract-by-contract basis.
If an enforceable right to payment for work-in-process does not exist, revenue is recognized following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying contract.
For contracts requiring over time revenue recognition, the selection of the method to measure progress toward completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. The Company uses a cost-based input measurement of progress because it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer, which occurs as costs are incurred during the manufacturing process or as services are rendered. Under the cost-based measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the costs incurred to date.
Generally, there are no subjective customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to goods or services provided; if such requirements or obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations are fulfilled.

Plexus Corp.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The Company does not allow for a general right of return. Net sales include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling and out-of-pocket expenses. The corresponding shipping and handling costs and out-of-pocket expenses are included in cost of sales. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from net sales. 
Net sales from engineering design and development services, which are generally performed under contracts with a duration of twelve months or less, are typically recognized as program costs incurred by utilizing the proportional performance model. The completed performance model is used if certain customer acceptance criteria exist. Any losses are recognized when anticipated. Net sales from engineering design and development services were less than 
5
% of consolidated net sales for each of fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Income Taxes:
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods, and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset.

Foreign Currency Translation & Transactions: 
The Company translates assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the relevant balance sheet date and net sales, expenses and cash flows at the average exchange rates during the respective periods. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial statements are recorded as a component of "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)." Exchange gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved and remeasurement adjustments for foreign operations where the U.S. dollar is the functional currency are included in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as a component of "Miscellaneous, net." Exchange losses on foreign currency transactions were $
3.4
 million, $
1.8
 million and $
0.7
 million for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts include the amount of gain recognized in income during each fiscal year due to forward currency exchange contracts entered into to hedge recognized assets or liabilities ("non-designated hedges") the Company entered into during each respective year. Refer to Note 5, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements," for further details on derivatives.
Derivatives:
 All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheets at fair value. The Company periodically enters into forward currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps. On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a non-designated hedge or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (a "cash flow" hedge). The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes. Changes in the fair value of non-designated derivatives are recorded in earnings as are the gains or losses related to the hedged asset or liability. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" within shareholders' equity until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows. Certain forward currency exchange contracts are treated as cash flow hedges and, therefore, $
16.1
 million, $
1.1
 million and $(
5.0
) million was recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 5, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements," for further information.

Earnings Per Share:
 The computation of basic earnings per common share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and net income. The computation of diluted earnings per common share reflects additional dilution from share-based awards, excluding any with an antidilutive effect. See Note 7, "Earnings Per Share," for further information.
Share-based Compensation:
 The Company measures all grants of share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, at fair value and expenses them in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income over the service period (generally the vesting period) of the grant. See Note 9, "Benefit Plans," for further information.
Comprehensive Income (Loss): 
The Company follows the established standards for reporting comprehensive income (loss), which is defined as the changes in equity of an enterprise except those resulting from shareholder transactions.

Refer to Note 5, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements," for further explanation regarding the change in fair value of derivative instruments that is recorded to "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)."
Use of Estimates:
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments:
 The Company holds financial instruments consisting of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, certain deferred compensation assets held under trust arrangements, accounts payable, debt, derivatives and finance and operating lease obligations. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and finance and operating lease obligations as reported in the consolidated financial statements approximate fair value. Derivatives and certain deferred compensation assets held under trust arrangements are recorded at fair value. Accounts receivable are reflected at net realizable value based on anticipated losses due to potentially uncollectible balances. Anticipated losses are based on management’s analysis of historical losses and changes in customers’ credit status. The fair value of the Company’s debt excluding finance lease and other financing obligations was $
197.8
 million and $
374.3
 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The carrying value of the Company's debt was $
200.0
 million and $
383.0
 million as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company uses quoted market prices when available or discounted cash flows to calculate fair value. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described below. The fair values of the Company’s derivatives are disclosed in Note 5, "Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements." The fair values of the deferred compensation assets held under trust arrangements are discussed in Note 9, "Benefit Plans."
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (or exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. The input levels are:
Level 1: Quoted (observable) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the asset or liability.
Business and Credit Concentrations: 
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and derivative instruments, specifically related to counterparties. In accordance with the Company’s investment policy, the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and derivative instruments were placed with recognized financial institutions. The Company’s investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure in any one issue and the maturity date of the investment securities that typically comprise investment grade short-term debt instruments. Concentrations of credit risk in accounts receivable resulting from sales to major customers are discussed in Note 11, "Reportable Segments, Geographic Information and Major Customers". The Company, at times, requires cash deposits for services performed. The Company also closely monitors extensions of credit.

On June 15, 2018, the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the “2018 NPA”) pursuant to which it issued an aggregate of $
150.0
 million in principal amount of unsecured senior notes, consisting of $
100.0
 million in principal amount of 
4.05
% Series A Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2025, and $
50.0
 million in principal amount of 
4.22
% Series B Senior Notes, due on June 15, 2028 (collectively, the “2018 Notes”), in a private placement. The 2018 NPA includes customary operational and financial covenants with which the Company is required to comply, including, among others, maintenance of certain financial ratios such as a total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The 2018 Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time, subject to payment of a make-whole amount; interest on the 2018 Notes is payable semiannually. As of September 28, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the 2018 NPA.
On June 9, 2022, the Company refinanced its then-existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility (as amended by that certain Amendment No. 1 to Credit Agreement dated April 29, 2020, the "Prior Credit Facility") by entering into a new 
5
-year revolving credit facility (collectively with the Prior Credit Facility, referred to as the "Credit Facility"), which expanded the maximum commitment from $
350.0
 million to $
500.0
 million and extended the maturity from May 15, 2024 to June 9, 2027. The maximum commitment under the Credit Facility may be further increased to $
750.0
 million, generally by mutual agreement of the Company and the lenders, subject to certain customary conditions. During fiscal 2024, the highest daily borrowing was $
376.0
 million; the average daily balance was $
257.8
 million. The Company borrowed $
550.5
 million and repaid $
733.5
 million of revolving borrowings ("revolving commitment") under the Credit Facility during fiscal 2024. As of September 28, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants relating to the Credit Facility, which are generally consistent with those in the 2018 NPA discussed above. The Company is required to pay a commitment fee on the daily unused credit facility based on the Company's leverage ratio; the fee was 
0.100
% as of September 28, 2024.

Derivatives and Fair Value Measurements
All derivatives are recognized in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at their estimated fair value. The Company uses derivatives to manage the variability of foreign currency obligations. The Company has cash flow hedges related to forecasted foreign currency obligations, in addition to non-designated hedges to manage foreign currency exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes. 
The Company designates some foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency expenses. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" in the accompanying Consolidated Bala
nce Sheets until earnings are affected by the variability of the cash flows. In the next twelve months, the Company estimates t
hat $
11.3
 million of unrealized gains, net of tax, related to cash flow hedges will be reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings. Changes in the fair value of the non-designated derivatives related to recognized foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are recorded in "Miscellaneous, net" in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
The Company enters into forward currency exchange contracts for its operations in certain jurisdictions in the AMER and APAC segments on a rolling basis. The Company had cash flow hedges outstanding with a notional value of $
186.5
 million as of September 28, 2024, and a notional value of $
215.4
 million as of September 30, 2023. These forward currency contracts fix the exchange rates for the settlement of future foreign currency obligations that have yet to be realized. The total fair value of the forward currency exchange contracts was a $
11.3
 million asset as of September 28, 2024, and a $
5.0
 million liability as of September 30, 2023.
The Company had additional forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $
144.0
 million as of September 28, 2024, and a notional value of $
145.5
 million as of September 30, 2023. The Company did not designate these derivative instruments as hedging instruments. The net settlement amount (fair value) related to these contracts is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either a current or long-term asset or liability, depending on the term, and as an element of "Miscellaneous, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The total fair value of these derivatives was a $
2.7
 million asset as of September 28, 2024, and a $
1.3
 million liability as of September 30, 2023.

Fair Value Measurements:
Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (or exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company uses quoted market prices when available or discounted cash flows to calculate fair value. The accounting guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. The input levels are:
Level 1: Quoted (observable) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the asset or liability.

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2024 was largely consistent with the effective tax rate for fiscal 2023.

During fiscal 2024, the company recognized a benefit of approximately $
6.9
 million as a result of making a U.S. method change impacting the timing of income recognition for advanced payments.

This benefit was largely offset by a $
4.0
 million withholding tax accrual under the indefinite reinvestment assertion for one of its APAC subsidiaries. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 primarily due to the GILTI impact of the research and development capitalization requirement and the geographic distribution of worldwide earnings. 
During fiscal 2024, the Company recorded a $
2.7
 million increase to its valuation allowance due to continuing losses in various jurisdictions in all operating segments.
During fiscal 2023, the Company recorded a $
5.7
 million increase to its valuation allowance due to continuing losses in various jurisdictions in all operating segments. 
During fiscal 2022, the Company recorded a $
2.8
 million decrease to its valuation allowance primarily due to a net decrease of the valuation allowance in the EMEA segment driven by the release of the valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets of a foreign subsidiary. This is partially offset by continuing losses in certain jurisdictions within the AMER segment.

During fiscal 2024, the Company’s valuation allowance increased by $
3.7
 million, including the impact of foreign exchange movement. This increase is the result of increases to the valuation allowances against the net deferred tax assets in the EMEA, AMER, and APAC regions of $
2.0
 million, $
0.4
 million and $
1.3
 million, respectively. 
As of September 28, 2024, the Company had approximately $
230.9
 million of pre-tax state net operating loss carryforwards that expire between fiscal 2025 and 2045. Certain state net operating losses have a full valuation allowance against them. The Company also had approximately $
73.8
 million of pre-tax foreign net operating loss carryforwards that expire between fiscal 2027 and 2034 or are indefinitely carried forward. Certain foreign net operating losses have a full valuation allowance against them. 
The Company has been granted a tax holiday for a foreign subsidiary in the APAC segment. This tax holiday will expire on December 31, 2034, and is subject to certain conditions. During fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, the tax holiday resulted in tax reductions, net of the impact of the GILTI provisions of U.S. Tax Reform, of approximately $
37.3
 million ($
1.36
 per basic share, $
1.34
 per diluted share), $
25.9
 million ($
0.94
 per basic share, $
0.92
 per diluted share) and $
35.3
 million ($
1.27
 per basic share, $
1.24
 per diluted share), respectively.
The Company does not provide for taxes that would be payable if certain undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were remitted because the Company considers these earnings to be permanently reinvested. The deferred tax liability that has not been recorded for these earnings was approximately $
11.4
 million as of September 28, 2024. 
The Company has approximately $
19.6
 million of unrecognized tax benefits as of September 28, 2024. The Company has classified these amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as "Other liabilities" (non-current) in the amount of $
19.2
 million and an offset to "Deferred income taxes" (non-current asset) in the amount of $
0.4
 million as the payment is not anticipated within one year.

 million and $
13.6
 million for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.
The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The total accrued penalties and net accrued interest with respect to income taxes was approximately $
1.8
 million as of September 28, 2024, approximately $
1.1
 million as of September 30, 2023 and approximately $
0.5
 million as of October 1, 2022. The Company recognized $
0.7
 million of expense for accrued penalties and net accrued interest in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for fiscal 2024, $
0.6
 million for fiscal 2023 and less than $
0.3
 million in fiscal 2022. 
Within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that federal, state and foreign tax audit resolutions could reduce unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $
8.6
 million, either because the Company’s tax positions are sustained on audit, the Company agrees to their disallowance or the statute of limitations closes.

The Company files income tax returns, including returns for its subsidiaries, with federal, state, local and foreign taxing jurisdictions. The following tax years remain subject to examination by the respective major tax jurisdictions:

Leases
The Company’s lease portfolio includes both real estate and non-real estate type leases which are accounted for as either finance or operating leases. Real estate leases generally include office, warehouse and manufacturing facilities and non-real estate leases generally include equipment and vehicles. The Company determines if a contract is or contains a lease at inception. The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of less than 
1
 year to 
60
 years. Renewal options that are deemed reasonably certain are included as part of the lease term for purposes of calculating the right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and lease liability. Variable lease payments are generally expensed as incurred and include certain index-based changes in rent, certain nonlease components, such as maintenance and other services provided by the lessor, and other charges included in the lease. The Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and nonlease components, as such nonlease components are included in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability and included in the lease expense over the term of the lease. The Company uses a discount rate to calculate the ROU asset and lease liability. When the implicit rate is known or provided in the lease documents, the Company is required to use this rate. In cases in which the implicit rate is not known, the Company uses an estimated incremental borrowing rate.
Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recorded on the date the Company takes possession of the leased assets with expense recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leases with an estimated total term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and the lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Generally, the Company's lease agreements do not contain material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
The components of lease expense for fiscal years indicated were as follows (in thousands):

Benefit Plans
Share-based Compensation Plans:
 During fiscal 2024, the Company’s shareholders approved the Plexus Corp. 2024 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2024 Plan”). The 2024 Plan is a stock and cash-based incentive plan, and includes provisions by which the Company may grant executive officers, employees and directors stock options, stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), restricted stock (including restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance stock awards (including performance stock units ("PSUs"), other stock awards and cash incentive awards.  Similar awards were offered under its predecessor, the Plexus Corp. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "2016 Plan"), which is no longer being used for grants of new awards; however, outstanding awards granted under the 2016 Plan and its predecessors continue until vesting, exercise, forfeiture or expiration.  
The maximum number of shares of Plexus common stock that may be issued pursuant to the 2024 Plan is 
0.8
 million shares. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors may establish a term and vesting period for awards under the 2024 Plan as well as accelerate the vesting of such awards. RSUs granted to executive officers, other officers and key employees generally vest on the 
3
 year anniversary of the grant date (assuming continued employment), which is also the date as of which the underlying shares will be issued. 
PSUs are payable in shares of the Company's common stock and have a performance period of 
three years
. For PSUs, approximately 
50
% vest based on the relative total shareholder return ("TSR") of the Company's common stock as compared to the companies in the S&P 400 Index for grants issued. The remaining approximately 
50
% of PSUs vest based upon a 
three
-point annual average of the Company's absolute economic return, a performance condition, with grants being subject to an individual year minimum and maximum absolute economic return. For PSUs based on TSR, the vesting and payout of awards will range between 
0
% and 
150
% of shares granted. For PSUs based on absolute economic return, the vesting and payout of awards will range between 
0
% and 
200
% of shares granted. Payout at target, 
100
% of the shares granted, will occur if the TSR of Plexus stock is at the 
50
th percentile of companies in the S&P 400 Index during the performance period and if a 
2.5
% average economic return is achieved over the performance period of 
three years
. The Company uses the Monte Carlo valuation model to value performance stock units with market conditions and the share price on the date of the grant for performance stock units that vest based on non-market-based performance conditions. The number of shares that may be issued pursuant to PSUs ranges from 
zero
 to 
0.5
 million and is dependent upon the Company's TSR and economic return performance over the applicable performance periods. The Committee also grants RSUs to non-employee directors, which generally fully vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, which is also the date the underlying shares are issued (unless further deferred). 
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense, reduced for estimated forfeitures, primarily in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The Company recognized $
30.3
 million, $
21.3
 million and $
23.3
 million of compensation expense associated with share-based awards in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Included in the $
30.3
 million of total stock-based compensation expense for the year ended September 28, 2024, was $
5.1
 million related to modifications of awards from executive retirement agreements. The award modifications were the result of accelerated vesting of previously unvested awards upon their retirements.

401(k) Savings Plan:
 The Company’s 401(k) Retirement Plan covers all eligible U.S. employees. The Company matches employee contributions up to 
4.0
% of eligible earnings. The Company’s contributions for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 totaled $
9.6
 million, $
9.8
 million and $
9.3
 million, respectively.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (Deferred Compensation Arrangement):
 The Company maintains a supplemental executive retirement plan (the "SERP") as a deferred compensation plan for executive officers. Under the SERP, a covered executive may elect to defer some or all of the participant’s compensation into the plan, and the Company may credit the participant’s account with a discretionary employer contribution. Participants are entitled to payment of deferred amounts and any related earnings upon termination or retirement from Plexus.
The SERP allows investment of deferred compensation into individual accounts and, within these accounts, into one or more designated investments. Investment choices do not include Plexus stock. During fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company made contributions to the participants’ SERP accounts in the amount of $
1.0
 million, $
0.9
 million and $
0.8
 million, respectively.
As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the SERP assets held in the trust totaled $
15.4
 million and $
12.4
 million, respectively, and the related liability to the participants totaled approximately $
15.4
 million and $
12.4
 million, respectively. As of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the SERP assets held in the trust were recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, and were classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy discussed in Note 1, "Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies."
The trust assets are subject to the claims of the Company’s creditors. The trust assets and the related liabilities to the participants are included in non-current "Other assets" and non-current "Other liabilities," respectively, in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Litigation
The Company is party to lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. We record provisions in the consolidated financial statements for pending legal matters when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
During fiscal 2023, the Company paid a one-time, non-recurring payment of $
15.8
 million related to an arbitration decision in Norway regarding a contractual matter concluded in May 2023. This payment resulted in a $
14.2
 million one-time, non-recurring charge, net of insurance recoveries and amounts previously accrued. During fiscal 2024, the Company received $
2.3
 million of additional insurance proceeds related to this decision. The Company no longer provides services for this customer. Refer to Note 16, "Restructuring and Non-recurring Charges," for information regarding total charges. The Company does not expect further charges relating to this matter.
Management does not believe that any other such proceedings, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material positive or adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, legal proceedings and regulatory and governmental matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could involve substantial fines, civil or criminal penalties, and other expenditures.
11.    
Reportable Segments, Geographic Information and Major Customers
Reportable segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in assessing performance and allocating resources. The Company uses an internal management reporting system, which provides important financial data to evaluate performance and allocate the Company’s resources on a regional basis. Net sales for the segments are attributed to the region in which the product is manufactured or the service is performed. The services provided, manufacturing processes used, class of customers serviced and order fulfillment processes used are similar and generally interchangeable across the segments. A segment’s performance is evaluated based upon its operating income. A segment’s operating income includes its net sales less cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses, but excludes corporate and other expenses. Corporate and other expenses primarily represent corporate selling and administrative expenses, and restructuring costs and other charges, if any, such as the $
20.3
 million, $
23.1
 million and $
2.0
 million of restructuring and other charges in fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  These costs are not allocated to the segments, as management excludes such costs when assessing the performance of the segments. Inter-segment transactions are generally recorded at amounts that approximate arm’s length transactions. The accounting policies for the segments are the same as for the Company taken as a whole.

Guarantees
The Company offers certain indemnifications under its customer manufacturing agreements. In the normal course of business, the Company may from time to time be obligated to indemnify its customers or its customers’ customers against damages or liabilities arising out of the Company’s negligence, misconduct, breach of contract, or infringement of third-party intellectual property rights. Certain agreements have extended broader indemnification, and while most agreements have contractual limits, some do not. However, the Company generally does not provide for such indemnities and seeks indemnification from its customers for damages or liabilities arising out of the Company’s adherence to customers’ specifications or designs or use of materials furnished, or directed to be used, by its customers. The Company does not believe its obligations under such indemnities are material.
In the normal course of business, the Company also provides its customers a limited warranty covering workmanship, and in some cases materials, on products manufactured by the Company. Such warranty generally provides that products will be free from defects in the Company’s workmanship and meet mutually agreed-upon specifications for periods generally ranging from 
12
 months to 
24
 months. The Company’s obligation is generally limited to correcting, at its expense, any defect by repairing or replacing such defective product. The Company’s warranty generally excludes defects resulting from faulty customer-supplied components, design defects or damage caused by any party or cause other than the Company.
The Company provides for an estimate of costs that may be incurred under its limited warranty at the time product revenue is recognized and establishes additional reserves for specifically identified product issues. These costs primarily include labor and materials, as necessary, associated with repair or replacement and are included in the Company's accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets in "other accrued liabilities." The primary factors that affect the Company’s warranty liability include the value and the number of shipped units and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims. As these factors are impacted by actual experience and future expectations, the Company assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.
Below is a table summarizing the activity related to the Company’s limited warranty liability for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):

 The MUFG RPA will be automatically extended each year unless any party gives no less than 
10
 days prior notice that the agreement should not be extended. The terms of the HSBC RPA are generally consistent with the terms of the MUFG RPA.
Transfers of receivables under the programs are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, receivables sold under the programs are excluded from accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are reflected as cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Proceeds from the transfer reflect the face value of the receivables less a discount. The sale discount is recorded within "Miscellaneous, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in the period of the sale. The Company continues servicing receivables sold and performing all accounts receivable administrative functions, in exchange receives a servicing fee, under both the MUFG RPA and HSBC RPA. Servicing fees related to trade accounts receivable programs recognized during fiscal 
2024

Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Revenue is recognized over time for arrangements with customers for which: (i) the Company's performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Company, and (ii) the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date. Revenue recognized over time is estimated based on costs incurred to date plus a reasonable profit margin. If either of the two conditions noted above are not met to recognize revenue over time, revenue is recognized following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying arrangement.
The Company recognizes revenue when a contract exists and when, or as, it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a customer. Contracts are accounted for when they have approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer.  
The Company generally enters into a master services arrangement that establishes the framework under which business will be conducted. These arrangements represent the master terms and conditions of the Company's services that apply to individual orders, but they do not commit the customer to work with, or to continue to work with, the Company nor do they obligate the customer to any specific volume or pricing of purchases. Moreover, these terms can be amended in appropriate situations.
Customer purchase orders are received for specific quantities with predominantly fixed pricing and delivery requirements. Thus, for the majority of our contracts, there is no guarantee of any revenue to the Company until a customer submits a purchase order. As a result, the Company generally considers its arrangement with a customer to be the combination of the master services arrangement and the purchase order. Most of the Company's arrangements with customers create a single performance obligation as the promise to transfer the individual manufactured product or service is capable of being distinct.

Plexus Corp.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The Company’s performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time. A performance obligation is satisfied over time if the Company has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin. Determining if an enforceable right to payment includes a reasonable profit margin requires judgment and is assessed on a contract-by-contract basis.
Generally, there are no subjective customer acceptance requirements or further obligations related to goods or services provided; if such requirements or obligations exist, then a sale is recognized at the time when such requirements are completed and such obligations are fulfilled.
The Company does not allow for a general right of return. Net sales include amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling and out-of-pocket expenses. The corresponding shipping and handling costs and out-of-pocket expenses are included in cost of sales. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from net sales.
Contract Costs
For contracts requiring over time revenue recognition, the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. The Company uses a cost-based input measurement of progress because it best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer, which occurs as costs are incurred during the manufacturing process or as services are rendered. Under the cost-based measure of progress, the extent of progress toward completion is measured based on the costs incurred to date. 
There were no other costs to obtain or fulfill customer contracts.

For fiscal

 approximately 
83
% of the Company's revenue was recognized as products and services transferred over time. For fiscal 
2023 and 
2022 approximately 
82
% and 
84
% of the Company's revenue was recognized as products and services  transferred over time.
Contract Balances
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, contract assets and deferred revenue on the Company’s accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Contract Assets
: For performance obligations satisfied at a point in time, billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, at which point the customer has been billed and the resulting asset is recorded within accounts receivable. For performance obligations satisfied over time as work progresses, the Company has an unconditional right to payment, which results in the recognition of contract assets. 
The following table summarizes the activity in the Company's contract assets during fiscal 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

Deferred Revenue
: Deferred revenue is recorded when consideration is received from a customer prior to transferring goods or services to the customer under the terms of the contract, which is included in advanced payments from customers on Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of 
September 28, 2024
 and September 30, 2023 the balance of advance payments from customers attributable to deferred revenue was $
154.7
 million and $
158.7
 million, respectively. The advance payment is not considered a significant financing component because it is used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect the company from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. Deferred revenue is recognized into revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met. For performance obligations satisfied over time, recognition will occur as work progresses; otherwise deferred revenue will be recognized based upon shipping terms.

ITEM 9.    CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
None.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information the Company must disclose in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis. The Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") have reviewed and evaluated, with the participation of the Company’s management, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of September 28, 2024, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective, at the reasonable assurance level, (a) in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, and (b) in assuring that information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Management of the Company, including its CEO and CFO, has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, based on the criteria established in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") (2013). Based on its assessment and those criteria, management has reached the conclusion that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 28, 2024.
The independent registered public accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024, as stated in its report included herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations on the effectiveness of controls, we have nonetheless reached the conclusion that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective.
