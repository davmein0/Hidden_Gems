ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS
Material risk factors to our business and financial performance are those that may impact our strategy, which is centered around four strategic pillars: 
Market Focus, Superior Execution, Passion Meets Purpose 
and
 Discipline by Design
. This section lays out a number of material risks that may impact those strategic pillars. Other sections of this report also include risks that may impact our strategic business objectives and affect our financial performance. The risks included herein and elsewhere in this report are not exhaustive. In addition, due to the dynamic nature of our business, new risks may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict or assess the impact of all such risks on our business.

Risks impacting our Market Focus
The end markets we serve require technologically advanced products and such markets may be impacted by a number of factors that could adversely impact our customers’ demand.
Factors affecting the technology-dependent end markets that we serve could adversely affect our customers and, as a result, Plexus. These factors include:
•
customers’ ability or inability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, such as artificial intelligence, and evolving industry standards that can result in short product life-cycles or product obsolescence
•
customers’ ability or inability to develop and market their products, some of which are new and untested
•
the potential failure of our customers’ products to gain widespread commercial acceptance, and
•
the availability of the components required to manufacture and service our customers' products.
Even if our customers successfully respond to these market challenges, their responses, including any consequential changes we must make in our business relationships, services offered, or to our operations, can affect our production cycles, working capital levels and results of operations.
Our customers do not make long-term commitments to us and may cancel or change their production requirements, which may strain resources and negatively impact our revenue, working capital levels and our operating results.
We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and frequently do not have visibility as to their future demand for our services. Customers also cancel, change or delay design, manufacturing or sustaining services demand and schedules, or fail to meet their forecasts for a number of reasons beyond our control. Customer expectations can change rapidly, requiring us to take on additional commitments or risks. In addition, customers may fail to meet their commitments to us or our expectations. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer, or by a group of customers, could seriously harm our operating results and negatively affect our working capital levels. Such cancellations, reductions or delays have occurred from time to time and may continue to occur in the future. This risk continues to be heightened by potential volatility in end-market demand for our customers' products or our services as a result of external factors such as the current inflationary environment, global conflicts, regulatory change and general economic uncertainty.
In addition, we make significant decisions based on our estimates of customers’ demand, including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, working capital management, facility and capacity requirements, facility footprint planning, personnel needs and other resource requirements. The short-term nature of our customers’ commitments and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products affect our ability to accurately estimate their future requirements. Because certain of our operating expenses are fixed in the short or long term, a reduction in customer demand can harm our operating results. 
Rapid increases in customer demand may stress personnel and other capacity resources. We may not have sufficient resources, including personnel and components, at any given time to meet all of our customers’ demands or to meet the requirements of a specific program, which could result in a loss of business from such customers. Rapid decreases in customer demand may result in operational inefficiencies and excess inventory, which could harm our gross profit margins and results of operations.
The need for us to correctly anticipate component needs is amplified in times of shortages. A tight component supply and other factors discussed above, can increase the difficulties and cost of anticipating changing demand. Moreover, because our margins vary across customers and specific programs, a reduction in revenue with higher margin customers or programs will have a more significant adverse effect on our operating results.

Increased competition may result in reduced demand or reduced prices for our services.
Our industry is highly competitive. We compete against numerous providers with global operations, as well as those which operate on only a local or regional basis. In addition, current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of designing, manufacturing and servicing products internally and may choose to design, manufacture or service products (including products or product types that we currently design, manufacture or service for them) themselves rather than outsource such activities. Consolidations and other changes in our industry may result in a changing competitive landscape.
Our competitors may:
•
respond more quickly than us to advancements in technology, such as artificial intelligence
•
be faster to develop new business models or otherwise adapt to evolving customer requirements and expectations
•
have greater name recognition, critical mass and geographic and market presence generally or within specific technologies or subsectors
•
be better able to identify and take advantage of acquisition opportunities
•
have lower internal cost structures
•
have greater direct buying power with component suppliers and distributors
•
devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their services and execution of their strategy
•
be better positioned to compete on price for their services
•
have technological expertise, capabilities and/or resources that are greater than ours
•
have excess capacity, and be better able to utilize such excess capacity
•
be better positioned to add additional resources, and
•
be willing or able to make sales or provide services at lower margins than we do.
Our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, and companies with greater resources or a greater market presence may enter our market or otherwise become increasingly competitive. Increased competition could result in significant price reductions, reduced sales and margins, or loss of market share.
The majority of our net sales come from a relatively small number of customers and a limited number of market sectors; if we lose a major customer or program or if there are challenges in those market sectors, then our net sales and operating results could decline significantly.
Our 10 largest customers accounted for 47.8% and 49.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. During fiscal 2023, there was one customer that represented 10.0% or more of our net sales. 
Our major customers may vary from period to period, and our major customers may not continue to purchase services from us at current levels, or at all, particularly given the volatile or temporary nature of certain programs. In any given period, a higher portion of our sales may be concentrated with customers or projects with relatively lower margins, which could adversely affect our results. We have experienced from time to time, and in the future may experience, significant disengagements with customers or of programs, adverse changes in customer supply chain strategies and the end-of-life of significant programs. Especially given our discrete number of customers, the loss of, or significant reductions in net sales to, any of our major customers or our failure to make appropriate choices as to the customers we serve could seriously harm our business and results of operations.
In addition, we focus our sales efforts on customers in only a few market sectors, as identified in Part I, Item 1, herein. Each of these sectors is subject to macroeconomic conditions as well as trends and conditions that are sector specific. Any weakness in our customers’ end markets could affect our business and results of operations. Economic, business or regulatory conditions that affect the sector, or our failure to choose to do business in appropriate subsectors, can particularly impact us. For instance, sales in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector are substantially affected by trends in the healthcare industry, such as government reimbursement rates and uncertainties relating to the U.S. healthcare sector generally. In addition, the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector is affected by health crises and trends. The semiconductor industry has historically been subject to significant cyclicality and volatility. Changing export regulations, increasing sanctions or other trade barriers may limit our ability to use or produce certain technologies or products in China or sell certain components or products that are ultimately destined to China. Further, potential reductions in U.S. government agency spending, including those due to budget cuts or other political developments or issues, could affect opportunities in all of our market sectors. 
We rely on timely and regular payments from our customers, and the inability or failure of our major customers to meet their obligations to us or their bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also have receivables factoring agreements in place; therefore, deterioration in the payment experience with or credit quality of our customers with respect to which we factor receivables, or issues with the banking counterparties to 
12
Table of Contents
our factoring agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to factor such receivables. 
From time to time, our customers have been affected by merger, acquisition, divestiture and spin-off activity. While these transactions may present us with opportunities to capture new business, they also create the risk that these customers will partially reduce their purchases or completely disengage from us as a result of transitioning such business to our competitors or their internal operations.
We and our customers are subject to increasingly extensive government regulations, legal requirements and industry standards; a failure to comply with current and future regulations, requirements and standards could have an adverse effect on our business, customer relationships, reputation and profitability.
We and our customers are subject to extensive government regulation, legal requirements and industry standards (as well as customer-specific standards) relating to the products we design, manufacture and service as well as how we conduct our business. This includes regulations and standards relating to labor and employment practices, workplace health and safety, operating practices and quality systems, the environment, sourcing and global trade practices, usage of emerging technologies, data privacy and protection, ethics, financial reporting, the market sectors we support and many other facets of our operations. The regulatory climate in the U.S. and other countries has become increasingly complex and fragmented, and regulatory enforcement activity has increased in recent periods. Rulings of the U.S. Supreme Court and other courts may affect the regulatory environment. Regulatory changes and restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice. A failure to comply with laws, regulations or standards applicable to our business can result in, among other consequences, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure of devices, total or partial suspension of production, including debarment, and could have an adverse effect on our reputation, customer relationships, profitability and results of operations. 
Our Healthcare/Life Sciences sector is subject to statutes and regulations covering the design, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling and servicing of medical devices and the reporting of certain information regarding their safety, including regulations by the Food and Drug Administration and similar regulations in other countries. We also design, manufacture and service products for certain industries, including certain applications where the U.S. government is the end customer, that face significant regulation by the Department of Defense, Department of State, Department of Commerce, Federal Aviation Authority and other governmental agencies in the U.S. as well as in other countries, and also under the Federal Acquisition Regulation. In addition, whenever we pursue business in new sectors and subsectors, or our customers pursue new technologies or markets, we need to navigate the potentially heavy regulatory and legislative burdens of such sectors, as well as standards of quality systems, technologies or markets. Failure to navigate these regulatory obligations and burdens could impact our operating results as well as cause reputational damage.
The regulatory climate can itself affect the demand for our services. For example, government reimbursement rates and other regulations, the financial health of healthcare providers, and changes in how healthcare systems are structured, and how medical devices are taxed, could affect the willingness and ability of end customers to purchase the products of our customers in the Healthcare/Life Sciences sector as well as impact our margins.
Our customers are also required to comply with various government regulations, legal requirements and industry standards, including many of the industry-specific regulations discussed above. Our customers’ failure to comply could affect their businesses or reputation, which in turn would affect our sales to them and pose potential reputational risk to us. In addition, if our customers are required by regulation or other requirements to make changes to their products or in their product lines, these changes could significantly disrupt particular programs we have in place for these customers and create inefficiencies in our business. Failure of our customers to identify or flow down any such requirements to us could result in production of non-compliant product, which could restrict their ability to sell such products, thus affecting our sales to them.

Table of Contents
We may fail to identify acquisition targets, successfully complete future acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired operations or recognize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition, which could adversely affect our operating results.
If we pursue new capabilities or geographies to enable growth through acquisitions, such activities would involve significant risks that could have a material adverse effect on us. These include operating risks such as the inability to successfully identify acquisition targets or, once a target is identified, to successfully negotiate and close an acquisition; to integrate businesses, systems and personnel; to navigate potential impacts on customer programs and relationships; and to realize anticipated synergies or economies of scale. They also include strategic risks such as the diversion of management time and attention from other business activities and opportunities and financial risks such as the use of cash or incurrence of additional debt and interest expense as consideration for the acquisition and to fund the activities required to pursue acquisitions, the potential volatility or weakness in our stock price as a result of the announcement of such transactions, the incurrence of large write-offs or write-downs as a result of the acquisition and other potential financial impacts. 
Risks impacting our Superior Execution
Plexus is a multinational corporation and operating in multiple countries exposes us to increased risks, including adverse local developments and currency risks.
We have operations in many countries. Operations outside of the U.S. in the aggregate represent a majority of our net sales and operating income, with a particular concentration in Malaysia. In addition, although we have repatriated a substantial amount of cash since the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. Tax Reform”) in 2017, a significant amount of our cash balances remain held outside of the U.S., with a particular concentration in Malaysia and China. We support customers operating in various countries and purchase a significant number of components manufactured in various countries. These international aspects of our operations, which are likely to increase over time, including with any introduction of facilities in new locations, subject us to risks that could materially impact our operations and operating results, such as the following:
•
economic, political or civil instability
•
civil or international conflicts and war, including the risk of escalation in the Russia-Ukraine war, conflict in the Middle East, escalating tensions between China and Taiwan as well as China and the U.S.
•
transportation delays or interruptions
•
exchange rate fluctuations
•
potential disruptions or restrictions on our ability to access cash amounts held outside of the U.S.
•
changes in labor markets, such as government-mandated wage increases, increases to minimum wage requirements, changes in union-related laws, regulations or practices, limitations on immigration or the free movement of labor or restrictions on the use of migrant workers, and difficulties in appropriately staffing and managing personnel in diverse cultures and increased public scrutiny on labor practices
•
customers shifting parts of their manufacturing and supply chains to different countries, including re-shoring, which may impact footprint needs and create operational disruption due to transition efforts
•
compliance with laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the European Union’s (EU's) General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), applicable to companies with global operations
•
changing global trade regulations, particularly relating to advanced semiconductors and chip-manufacturing equipment, which may limit the ability to ship certain components or product to customers in China, support certain programs in our China operations, and source the components necessary to manufacture customer product in China
•
changes in the taxation of earnings in the U.S. and in other countries
•
reputational risks related to, among other factors, varying standards and practices among countries
•
changes in duty rates
•
significant natural disasters and other events or factors impacting local infrastructure
•
the effects of other international political developments, such as tariffs, embargoes, sanctions, boycotts, trade wars, energy disruptions, trade agreements and changes in trade policies, including those which may be affected by the U.S. and other countries’ political reactions to those actions, and
•
other regulatory and legal requirements and industry standards, and changes thereto.
As our international operations continue to expand, our failure to appropriately address foreign currency transactions or the currency exposures associated with assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, developments affecting particular countries can adversely affect our ability to access cash or other assets held in such countries.

Table of Contents
A significant portion of our operations is currently located in the APAC region, particularly in Malaysia. The concentration of our operations, workforce, assets and profitability in that region exposes us to adverse developments, economic, political or otherwise, in those countries.
Changes in policies or trade agreements by or changes in elected officials of the U.S. or other governments could negatively affect our operating results due to trade wars, changes in duties, tariffs or taxes, currency exchange rate fluctuations, higher costs of compliance, or limitations on currency or fund transfers, as well as government-imposed restrictions on producing certain products in, or shipping them to, specific countries. Our current facilities in Mexico operate under the Mexican Maquiladora (“IMMEX”) program. This program provides for reduced tariffs and eased import regulations. We could be adversely affected by changes in the IMMEX program or our failure to comply with its requirements. 
Additionally, continued uncertainty regarding commercial dealings, tariffs, export regulations and other trade protection measures between the U.S. and China, heightened by escalating geopolitical tensions, may affect our ability to do business in China, may impact the cost of our products originating in China and may impact the demand for our products manufactured in China in the event our customers reduce or eliminate their operations in China. These actions could also affect the cost and/or availability of materials or components that we procure from suppliers in China, as well as create disruptions, delays, shortages or increased costs within our global supply chain. Government-imposed restrictions on where we or our customers can produce certain types of products or source components or with whom we can conduct business, such as named companies or industries identified in the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, outbound investment restrictions, and trade regulations limiting advanced semiconductors and chip-manufacturing equipment, could limit our ability to sell or manufacture products or services in China, or source components from certain companies or geographies. These factors can negatively affect our operating results and financial position, including reducing our revenues and profitability as a result of having to minimize engagements in China, requiring us to shift such production to other potentially higher-cost locations, or increasing the cost of sourcing components.
Further, the extent to which the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, conflict in the Middle East or the escalating tensions between China and Taiwan or China and the U.S. may impact our business or results of operations will depend on future developments, including the severity and duration of any conflicts, their impact on global supply chains and their impact on regional and global economic conditions including the ability of our customers or suppliers to do business in those or surrounding countries and the inflationary effects of such conflicts on our profitability. These tensions have resulted in, and may continue to cause, global disruptions creating significant volatility in financial markets and the global economy. 
We experience component shortages, delays, price fluctuations and supplier quality concerns.
We generally do not have long-term supply agreements. We have experienced from time to time, and may in the future experience, significant component shortages and longer lead-times due to supplier capacity constraints. Supply chain constraints and delays can be caused by world events, such as government policies, tariffs, trade wars, trade disputes and trade protection measures, terrorism, armed conflict, natural disasters, natural resource availability, economic recession, increased demand due to economic growth or technological advancements, preferential allocations, transportation challenges, and other localized events. Further, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for many of the components used in the assembly process and, in some cases, may be required to use suppliers that are the sole provider of a particular component. Such suppliers may encounter quality problems, labor disputes or shortages, financial difficulties or business continuity issues that could preclude them from delivering components timely or at all. Supply shortages and delays in deliveries of components may result in delayed manufacturing or servicing of products, which reduces our revenue and operating profit for the periods affected. Additionally, a delay in obtaining a particular component may result in other components for the related program being held for longer periods of time, increasing working capital, risking inventory obsolescence and negatively impacting our cash flow.
In addition, components that are delivered to us may not meet our specifications or other quality criteria. Certain components provided to us may be counterfeit or violate the intellectual property rights of others. The need to obtain replacement components may negatively affect our operations and operating results. The inadvertent use of any such components may also give rise to liability claims. Further, the commitments made to us by our suppliers, and the terms applicable to such relationships, may not match all the commitments we make to, and the terms of our arrangements with, our customers, and such variations may lead us to incur additional expense or liability and/or cause other disruptions to our business.
Component supply shortages and delays in deliveries, along with other factors such as tariffs, trade disputes or embargoes, inflation, and rising energy and transportation costs, can also result in increased pricing. While many of our customers permit quarterly or other periodic adjustments to pricing based on changes in component prices and other factors, we have in the past and may continue to bear the risk of price increases that occur between any such repricing or, if such repricing is not permitted, during the balance of the term of the particular customer contract. In addition, these repricing or pricing recoveries have been 
15
Table of Contents
and may continue to be dilutive to our operating margin. Conversely, as a result of our pricing strategies and practices, component price reductions have contributed positively to our operating results in the past. Our inability to continue to benefit from such reductions in the future could adversely affect our operating results, cash flows and inventory levels, which could increase as a result of higher component prices or the negative effects of inflation on customer end-market demand.
Due to the highly competitive nature of our industry, an inability to obtain sufficient inventory of quality components on a timely basis and for a reasonable price, could also harm relationships with our customers and lead to loss of business to our competitors.
Our services involve other inventory risk.
Most of our services are provided on a turnkey basis, under which we purchase some, or all, of the required materials and components based on customer forecasts or orders. Although, in general, our commercial contracts with our customers obligate our customers to ultimately purchase inventory ordered to support their forecasts or orders, we generally finance these purchases initially. In addition, suppliers at times require us to purchase materials and components in minimum order quantities that may exceed customer requirements. A customer’s cancellation, delay or reduction of forecasts or orders can also result in excess inventory or additional expense to us. Engineering changes by a customer or a product’s end-of-life may result in obsolete materials or components. While we attempt to cancel, return or otherwise mitigate excess and obsolete inventory, require customers to reimburse us for these items and/or price our services to address related risks, we may not actually be reimbursed timely or in full, be able to collect on these obligations or adequately reflect such risks in our pricing. In addition to increasing inventory in certain instances to support new program ramps, we may also increase inventory if we experience component shortages or longer lead-times for certain components in order to maintain a high level of customer service. In such situations, we may procure components earlier, which leads to an increase in inventory in the short term and may lead to increased excess or obsolete inventory in the future. Excess or obsolete inventory, the need to acquire increasing amounts of inventory due to shortages, customer demand or otherwise, or other failures to manage our working capital, could adversely affect our operating results, including our return on invested capital.
In addition, we provide managed inventory programs for some of our customers under which we hold and manage finished goods or work-in-process inventories. These managed inventory programs may result in higher inventory levels, further reduce our inventory turns and increase our financial exposure with such customers. In addition, our inventory may be held at a customer’s facility or warehouse, or elsewhere in a location outside of our control, which may increase the risk of loss. Even though our customers generally have contractual obligations to purchase such inventories from us, we remain subject to customers’ credit risks as well as the risk of potential customer default and the need to enforce those obligations.
An inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation or execution of information systems, or to adequately maintain these systems and their security, as well as to protect data and other confidential information, may adversely affect our business and reputation.
As a global company with a complex business model, we are heavily dependent on our information systems to support our customers’ requirements and to successfully manage our business. Any inability to successfully manage the procurement, development, implementation, execution or maintenance of our information systems, including matters related to system and data security, cybersecurity, privacy, reliability, compliance, performance and access, as well as any inability of these systems to fulfill their intended purpose within our business, could have an adverse effect on our business. We periodically make strategic investments in enterprise-wide systems, as prior systems reach end-of-life, to enable global scalability or to add capability. Implementing new technology on this scale is complex and can create operational disruption if the implementation fails to meet our expectations.
In the ordinary course of business, we collect and store sensitive data and information, including our proprietary and regulated business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information about our employees. Our information systems, like those of other companies, are susceptible to malicious damage, intrusions and outages due to, among other events, viruses, cyber threats, industrial espionage (internal or external), hacking, break-ins and similar events, other breaches of security, natural disasters, power loss or telecommunications failures. Due to the intellectual property we maintain on our systems related to high technology components, sub-components, manufacturing processes and our customers’ products, we are a likely target from various external cyber threats, such as lone attackers, nation states seeking to gain access to such intellectual property, as well as both unintentional and malicious internal threats. In addition, lone and organized crime elements have been known to extort money by encrypting their victims’ data (ransomware) and/or utilizing their victims’ resources for unauthorized mining of cryptocurrency. The reliance on third-party vendors in a complex supply chain can further introduce cybersecurity risks, as unmitigated vendor vulnerabilities or compromise can increase the attack surface for malicious actors.

Table of Contents
The increasing sophistication of cyberattacks requires us to continually evaluate the threat landscape and new technologies and processes intended to detect and prevent these attacks. There can be no assurance that the security measures and systems configurations we choose to implement will be sufficient to protect the data we manage. Any theft or misuse of information resulting from a security breach or cyberattack could result in, among other things, interruption to our operations, loss of significant and/or sensitive information, litigation by affected parties, financial obligations resulting from such theft or misuse, higher insurance premiums, governmental investigations, fines and penalties, negative reactions from current and potential future customers, and reputational damage, any of which could adversely affect our financial results.

Also, the time and funds spent on monitoring and mitigating our exposure and responding to breaches or attempted breaches, including the training of employees, the purchase of protective technologies and the hiring of additional employees and consultants to assist in these efforts could adversely affect our financial results.

This risk is enhanced as a result of the increasing sophistication of threat actors, including through the use of artificial intelligence, and an increase in our remote workforce due to evolving flexible workplace practices, for example by reason of utilizing home networks that may lack encryption or secure password protection, virtual meeting/conference security concerns and an increase of phishing/cyberattacks around our remote workforce's digital resources.
Moreover, we are subject to increasing 
data privacy, handling, and protection requirements and customer expectations due to the nature of their end products, including those related to the Export Administration Regulations, International Traffic in Arms Regulation, Federal Acquisition Regulation, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification
. Any operational failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to the loss or disclosure of our or our customers’ financial, product or other confidential information, result in adverse regulatory or other legal actions and have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data, globally. GDPR and similar legislation in jurisdictions in which we operate continue to evolve imposing additional obligations on companies regarding the handling and protection of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is processed and stored. Compliance with existing, proposed and recently enacted laws and regulations can be costly. Failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to protect personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against us by governmental entities or others, fines and penalties, damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.
We have a complex business model and are subject to rapidly changing technology requirements; our failure to properly manage or execute on that model and those requirements could adversely affect our operations, financial results and reputation.
Our business model focuses on products and services that are highly complex and subject to demanding regulatory requirements. Our customers’ products typically require significant production and supply-chain flexibility necessitating optimized solutions across an integrated global platform. The products we design, manufacture and service are also typically complex, heavily regulated and require complicated configuration management and direct order fulfillment capabilities to global end customers. 
Our business model requires working capital, management and technical personnel, and the development and maintenance of systems and procedures to manage diverse design, manufacturing, regulatory and sustaining services requirements for multiple programs of varying sizes simultaneously, including in multiple locations and geographies. We also depend on securing and ramping new customers and programs as well as transitioning production for new customers and programs, which creates added complexities related to managing the start-up risks of such projects, especially for companies that did not previously outsource such activities.
The complexity of our model, which encompasses a broad range of services including design and development, supply chain solutions, new product introduction, manufacturing and sustaining services, often results in complex and challenging contractual obligations and unique customer requirements. In addition, program complexity and associated customer expectations have increased in recent years with respect to certain capabilities, commitments, allocation of risk and compliance with third-party standards, requiring extraordinary measures to ensure operational execution and compliance within unique, non-standard engagements. If we fail to meet those obligations, or are otherwise unable to execute on our commitments or unsuccessfully mitigate such risks, then it could result in claims against us, regulatory violations, or adversely affect our reputation and our ability to obtain future business, as well as impair our ability to enforce our rights (including those related to payment) under those contracts. A failure to adequately understand unique customer requirements may also impact our ability to estimate and ultimately recover associated costs, adversely affecting our financial results.

Many of our customers' markets are characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving process developments. Our internal processes are also subject to these factors. The sustained success of our business will depend upon our continued ability to:
•
attract and retain qualified engineering and technical personnel, especially in times of tight labor markets 
•
choose, maintain and enhance appropriate technological and service capabilities
•
successfully manage the implementation and execution of information systems
•
develop and market services that meet changing customer needs
•
effectively and efficiently execute our services and perform to our customers’ expectations, and
•
successfully anticipate, or respond to, technological changes on a cost-effective and timely basis.
Although we believe that our operations utilize the technologies, equipment and processes that are currently required by our customers, we cannot be certain that we will maintain or develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. The emergence or advancement in technologies, such as artificial intelligence, industry standards or customer requirements may render our technical personnel, equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, we may have to acquire new skills, technologies and equipment to remain competitive, as well as offer new or additional services, all of which may require significant expense or capital investment that could reduce our liquidity and negatively affect our operating results. Our failure to anticipate and adapt to our customers’ changing technological needs and requirements, or to perform to their expectations or standards, as well as our need to maintain our personnel and other resources during times of fluctuating demand, could have an adverse effect on our business.
Physical risks, including natural disasters and weather events caused by global climate change, breaches of physical security and other events outside our control, and the ineffective management of such events, may harm our business.
Some of our facilities are located in areas that may be impacted by natural disasters including tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, water shortages, tsunamis or floods. Further, there continues to be concern that global climate change is impacting the frequency and severity of these natural disasters. All facilities are subject to other potential natural or man-made disasters such as those related to weather events or global climate change, fires, acts of terrorism or war, breaches of security, theft or espionage, workplace violence and failures of utilities. If such an event was to occur and we did not have an effective business continuity plan in place, our business could be harmed due to the event itself or due to our inability to effectively manage the effects of the particular event, with the impact of the event potentially magnified in areas where we have multiple facilities in close proximity. For example, we maintain significant production capacity in Penang, Malaysia, and an event in that geography could materially hinder our production capabilities. Potential harms include the loss of business continuity, financial risk, the loss of business data and damage to infrastructure. These natural disasters and physical climate risks could also disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials within our supply chain, and could also increase insurance and other operating costs. These factors may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in areas most prone to physical climate risks, such as our facilities in Malaysia that are at or near sea level.
In addition, some of our facilities possess certifications or unique equipment necessary to work on specialized products that our other locations lack. If work is disrupted at one of these facilities, it may be impractical or we may be unable to transfer such specialized work to another facility without significant costs and delays. Thus, any disruption in operations at a facility possessing specialized certifications or equipment could adversely affect our ability to provide products and services to our customers, and potentially have a negative effect on our relationships and financial results. While we maintain business continuity plans, including data system recovery protocols, to enable us to maintain operations following a natural disaster or other event that may be disruptive to our business, we cannot ensure these responses will fully mitigate or protect us from all disruptions. While we also carry insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty and other risks, insurance coverage, as well as our other risk mitigation efforts, may be inadequate, not cost-effective or unavailable, either in general or for particular types of events.
Although we have implemented policies and procedures with respect to physical security, we remain at risk of unauthorized access to our facilities and the possible unauthorized use or theft of inventory, information or other physical assets. If unauthorized persons gain physical access to our facilities, or our physical assets or information are stolen, damaged or used in an unauthorized manner (whether through outside theft or industrial espionage), we could be subject to, among other consequences, interruption in our operations, negative publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, loss of government contracts, litigation by affected parties or other future financial obligations related to the loss, misuse or theft of our or our customers’ data, inventory or physical assets, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations.

There may be problems with the products we design, manufacture or service that could result in liability claims against us, reduced demand for our services and damage to our reputation.
We design, manufacture and service products to our customers’ specifications, many of which are highly complex and subject to demanding regulatory environments for market sectors that generally have higher risk profiles for liability claims. Further, the services we provide to our customers continue to expand to encompass full product development, product commercialization, manufacturing, and sustaining services. As we assume more responsibility across the product lifecycle, our customers’ expectations have and may continue to extend beyond what has historically been expected of electronics manufacturing service providers, such as expectations related to environmental sustainability and heightened regulatory compliance support, including as it relates to product composition such as the Restrictions on Hazardous Substances ("RoHS") 2011/65/EU directive, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and restriction of Chemicals ("REACh") EC 1907/2006 EU directive, and emerging regulations pertaining to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances ("PFAS"). These dynamics increase the risks inherent in those engagements. Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, problems may occur, or may be alleged, in the execution of these services. Whether or not we are responsible, problems in the products we create, whether real or alleged, whether caused by faulty customer specifications, product design, manufacturing processes, servicing, a component defect or otherwise, may result in delayed shipments to customers or reduced or canceled customer orders or liability claims. If these problems were to occur in large quantities or too frequently, our business reputation may also be tarnished. In addition, such problems may result in liability claims against us, whether or not we are responsible. These potential claims may be initiated through various means, such as our contractual commitments, strict liability or other claims raised by third parties, and may include damages for the recall of a product, injury to person(s) or property, or other theories of liability.
Even if customers or third parties, such as component suppliers, are responsible for defects, they may not, or may not be able to, assume responsibility for any such costs or required payments to us. While we seek to secure contractual protection and/or to insure against many of these risks, we may not have practical recourse against certain third parties, and contractual protections, insurance coverage or supplier warranties, as well as our other risk mitigation efforts, may be inadequate, not cost-effective or unavailable, either in general or for particular types of products or issues. We occasionally incur costs defending claims, we may be unsuccessful in defending against claims and incur financial liabilities, and any such disputes could adversely affect our business relationships.
A failure to comply with customer-driven policies and standards, and third-party certification requirements or standards could adversely affect our business and reputation.
In addition to government regulations and industry standards, our customers may require us to comply with their own or third-party quality standards, commercial terms, or other business policies or standards, which may be more restrictive than current laws and regulations as well as our pre-existing policies and/or terms with our suppliers, before they commence, or continue, doing business with us. Such policies or standards may be customer-driven, established by the market sectors in which we operate or imposed by third-party organizations.
Our compliance with these heightened and/or additional policies, standards and third-party certification requirements, and managing a supply chain in accordance therewith, could be costly, and our failure to comply could adversely affect our operations, customer relationships, reputation and profitability. In addition, our adoption of these standards could adversely affect our cost competitiveness, ability to provide customers with required service levels and ability to attract and retain employees in jurisdictions where these standards vary from prevailing local customs and practices. In certain circumstances, to meet the requirements or standards of our customers we may be obligated to select certain suppliers or make other sourcing choices, and we may bear responsibility for adverse outcomes even if these matters are as the result of third-party actions or outside of our control.
Intellectual property infringement claims against our customers or us could harm our business.
Although our manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant proprietary protection, our services may and our customers' products do involve the creation and use of intellectual property rights, which subject us and our customers to the risk of claims of intellectual property infringement from third parties. In addition, our customers may require that we indemnify them against the risk of intellectual property infringement. If any claims are brought against us or our customers for infringement, whether or not these have merit, then we could be required to expend significant resources in defense of those claims. In the event of an infringement claim, we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop non-infringing alternatives or obtain licenses. We may not be successful in developing alternatives or obtaining licenses on reasonable terms or at all. Infringement by our customers could cause them to discontinue production of some of their products, potentially with little or no notice, which may reduce our net sales to them and disrupt our production.

Additionally, if third parties on whom we rely for products or services, such as component suppliers, are responsible for an infringement (including through the supply of counterfeit parts), we may or may not be able to hold them responsible and we may incur costs in defending claims or providing remedies. Such infringements may also cause our customers to abruptly discontinue selling the impacted products, which would adversely affect our net sales of those products and could affect our customer relationships more broadly. Similarly, claims affecting our suppliers could cause those suppliers to discontinue selling materials and components upon which we rely.
Risks impacting our Passion Meets Purpose
We depend on our workforce, and the inability to attract, develop and retain personnel or an increase in personnel costs or other personnel disruptions may harm our business.
If we fail to attract, develop and retain sufficient qualified personnel, including key leadership positions and highly skilled technical roles, our operations and, consequently, our financial results, could be adversely affected. A number of factors may adversely affect labor availability in one or more of our locations, including wage pressure and changing wage requirements, restrictions on immigration or labor mobility, local competition, high employment rates, high turnover rates and local labor laws. These labor-related issues and labor shortages are pronounced, and we expect these conditions to persist. 
We have also experienced inflationary or other general personnel cost increases due to economic conditions and government-mandated wage increases. Further, increases in turnover rates can lead to decreased efficiency and increased costs in our operations, such as increased overtime to meet demand, increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and costs associated with recruiting training replacement personnel. If we are unable to offset these labor cost increases through price increases, growth or operational efficiencies, labor cost increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows. 
We also depend on good relationships with our workforce. Monitoring employee engagement and maintaining a healthy workplace culture based on our core values is important to developing these good relationships and retaining a committed workforce. A failure to foster a strong, healthy culture, or a failure to adopt or maintain policies and practices that enhance our workplace culture or competitiveness, such as those related to diversity and inclusion, workplace flexibility or other employee benefits, could adversely impact our ability to attract, develop and retain personnel and could substantially affect our operations and financial results. Further, dissatisfied employees may be more likely to seek union organization, which could disrupt our business, increase the risk of a labor strike and adversely impact our operations, financial results, and reputation.
From time to time, there are changes and developments, such as retirements, promotions, transitions, disability, death and other terminations of service, that affect our executive officers and other key employees, including those that are unexpected or occur simultaneously. Transitions or other changes in responsibilities among officers and key employees without having identified and ready successors for these critical roles, particularly when such changes are unanticipated, unplanned or not executed effectively, inherently can cause disruptions to our business and operations, as well as harm our reputation, which could have an effect on our results. Further, as we grow in size and complexity, a failure to effectively develop personnel and plan for the succession of critical roles may result in shortfalls in the talent and skills required to execute effectively and grow our business, which could affect our operations and financial results.    
Evolving expectations on environmental, social and governance ("ESG") matters, including global climate change, by various stakeholders could negatively affect our business.
Customer, investor and employee expectations relating to ESG have been rapidly evolving and increasing.

In addition, governmental and non-governmental organizations are enhancing or advancing requirements specific to ESG matters. Specifically, certain stakeholders are beginning to request or require disclosures on ESG topics such as greenhouse gas emissions, human capital matters and specific ESG-risk management practices, and we expect this trend to continue and be amplified by existing and potential legislation, such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive in the European Union and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") climate rules. A failure to adequately meet stakeholder expectations and reporting requirements may result in noncompliance with any imposed regulations, the loss of business, reputational impacts, an inability to attract and retain customers, and an inability to attract and retain talent.  In addition, our adoption of certain standards, related reporting requirements, or mandated compliance to certain requirements could necessitate additional investments that could impact our profitability. 
Further, increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in new or enhanced requirements and/or stakeholder expectations to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions and transition to low-carbon alternatives, driven by policy and regulations, low-carbon technology advancement and shifting consumer sentiment and societal preferences. These transition risks could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations including 
20

by means of carbon pricing mechanisms, investments in lower greenhouse gas emissions technology, increased cost of raw materials and mandates on and regulation of existing products and services.

In addition, the economic and market uncertainty created by transitioning to low-carbon alternatives could result in reduced demand or product obsolescence for certain of our customers’ products and/or price modifications for our customers’ products and the resources needed to produce them.

This could in turn put pressure on our costs and result in reduced profit margin associated with certain of our customer programs, or loss of customer programs that we may not be able to replace. 
Risks impacting our Discipline By Design
Challenges associated with the engagement of new customers or programs, the provision of new services, or start-up costs and inefficiencies related to new, recent or transferred programs could affect our operations and financial results.
Our engagement with new customers, as well as the addition of new programs or types of services for existing customers, can present challenges in addition to opportunities. We must initially determine whether it would be in our interests from a business perspective to pursue a particular potential new customer, program or service, including evaluating whether the customer, program or service fits with our value proposition as well as its potential end-market success. If we make the decision to proceed, we need to ensure that our terms of engagement, including our pricing and other contractual provisions, appropriately reflect the strategic nature of the customer, anticipated costs, risks and rewards. The failure to make prudent engagement decisions or to establish appropriate terms of engagement could adversely affect our profitability and margins.
Also, there are inherent risks associated with the timing and ultimate realization of anticipated revenue and profitability from a new program or service; these factors can sometimes extend for a significant period. Some new programs or services require us to devote significant capital and personnel resources to new technologies and competencies. We may not meet customer expectations, which could damage our relationships with the affected customers and impact our ability to deliver conforming product or services on a timely basis. Further, the success of new programs may depend heavily on factors such as product reliability, market acceptance, regulatory approvals or economic conditions. The failure of a new program to meet expectations on these factors, or our inability to effectively execute on a new program’s or service’s requirements, could result in lost financial opportunities and adversely affect our results of operations.
In recent years, ramping new programs has been a key contributor to our revenue growth. The management of resources in connection with the establishment of new or recent programs and customer relationships and the need to estimate required resources in advance of production can adversely affect our gross and operating margins and level of working capital. These factors are particularly evident in the early stages of the life-cycle of new programs, which typically lack a track record of order volume and timing as well as production efficiencies in the early stages. We typically manage multiple new programs at any given time; therefore, we are exposed to these factors in varying magnitudes. 
The effects of these start-up costs and inefficiencies can also occur when we transfer programs between locations and geographies. We conduct these transfers on a regular basis to meet customer needs, seek long-term efficiencies or respond to market conditions, as well as due to facility openings and closures. Although we try to recover costs from our customers and minimize the potential losses arising from transitioning customer programs between our facilities and geographies, we may not be successful and there are inherent risks that such transitions can result in operational inefficiencies and the disruption of programs and customer relationships.
While these factors tend to affect new, recent or transferred programs, they can also impact more mature or maturing programs and customer relationships, especially programs where end-market demand can be somewhat volatile.
Failure to manage periods of growth or contraction may seriously harm our business.
Our industry frequently sees periods of expansion and contraction. We regularly contend with these issues and must carefully manage our business to meet changing customer and market requirements. If we fail to manage these growth and contraction decisions effectively, or fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these decisions, we can find ourselves with either excess or insufficient resources and our business, as well as our profitability, may suffer. Expansion and consolidation, including the transfer of operations to new or other facilities or due to acquisitions, can inherently include additional costs and start-up inefficiencies. For example, we are expanding our operations by constructing an additional manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia, to support our growth in the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, we may expand our operations in new geographical areas where currently we do not operate. If we are unable to effectively manage this or other expansions or consolidations, or 
21
Table of Contents
related anticipated net sales are not realized, our operating results could be adversely affected. Other risks of current or future expansions, acquisitions and consolidations include:
•
the inability to successfully integrate additional facilities or incremental capacity and to realize anticipated efficiencies, economies of scale or other value
•
challenges faced as a result of transitioning programs
•
incurrence of restructuring costs or other charges that may be insufficient or may not have their intended effects
•
additional fixed or other costs, or selling and administrative expenses, which may not be fully absorbed by new business
•
a reduction of our return on invested capital, including as a result of excess inventory or excess capacity at new facilities, as well as the increased costs associated with opening new facilities
•
difficulties in the timing of expansions, including delays in the implementation of construction and manufacturing plans
•
diversion of management's attention from other business areas during the planning and implementation of expansions
•
strain placed on our operational, financial and other systems and resources, and
•
inability to locate sufficient customers, employees or management talent to support the expansion.
Periods of contraction or reduced net sales, or other factors affecting particular sites, create other challenges. We must determine whether facilities remain viable, whether staffing levels need to be reduced and how to respond to changing levels of customer demand. While maintaining excess capacity or higher levels of employment entail short-term costs, reductions in capacity or employment could impair our ability to respond to new opportunities and programs, market improvements or to maintain customer relationships. Our decisions to reduce costs and capacity can affect our short-term and long-term results. When we make decisions to reduce capacity or to close facilities, we frequently incur restructuring costs. In Fiscal 2024, we closed an engineering facility in Darmstadt, Germany and a manufacturing facility in Portland, Oregon, and we incurred restructuring costs associated with both closures. 
In addition, to meet our customers' needs, particularly when the production requirements of certain products are site-specific, to achieve increased efficiencies or to address factors affecting specific locations, such as tariffs and trade disputes, we sometimes require additional capacity in one location while reducing capacity in another. Since customers’ needs and market conditions can vary and change rapidly, we may find ourselves in a situation where we simultaneously experience the effects of contraction in one location and expansion in another location. We may also encounter situations where our lack of a physical presence in certain locations may limit or foreclose opportunities.
Changes in tax laws, potential tax disputes, negative or unforeseen tax consequences or further developments affecting our deferred tax assets could adversely affect our results.
Our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic mix of earnings across the jurisdictions where we operate. Changes in tax laws or tax rates in those jurisdictions, including, but not limited to, as a result of actions by the U.S. (including additional guidance and interpretations related to U.S. Tax Reform or potential passage of tax regulation changes under the U.S. presidential administration) or other countries, could continue to have a material impact on our operating results. Among other things, we have been, and are expected to continue to be, affected by the global intangible low-taxed income provisions added by U.S. Tax Reform and related new tax legislation, interpretations and guidance. Our effective tax rate may also be impacted by tax holidays and other various tax credits granted by local taxing authorities. In addition, the implementation of U.S. Tax Reform has required the use of estimates, which may be refined in future periods. All incentives, including a tax holiday granted to our Malaysian subsidiary, are subject to certain terms and conditions, which could be unfavorably altered by the local taxing authorities or changes to U.S. tax policy. We would experience adverse tax consequences if we are found to not be in compliance.
A global minimum tax has been, or is anticipated to be, implemented in many of the countries in which Plexus operates. We anticipate this will materially and unfavorably impact our existing tax holidays and effective tax rate although to what extent is difficult to estimate without final rules and regulations. As of September 28, 2024, we expect those impacts to begin in fiscal 2026 and carry forward.
Our taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon the local taxing authority’s acceptance of our operational and intercompany transfer pricing practices as being at “arm’s length.” Due to inconsistencies among jurisdictions in the application of the arm’s length standard, our transfer pricing methods may be challenged and, if not upheld, could increase our income tax expense. Risks associated with transfer pricing adjustments are further highlighted by the global initiative from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development called the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ("BEPS") project. The BEPS project is challenging longstanding international tax norms regarding the taxation of profits from cross-border business. 
22
Table of Contents
Given the scope of our international operations and the fluid and uncertain nature of how the BEPS project might ultimately lead to future legislation, it is difficult to assess how any changes in tax laws would impact our income tax expense.
We review the probability of the realization of our net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income by jurisdiction. This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in each of our jurisdictions may require the creation of an additional valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets. Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made.
We may fail to secure or maintain necessary additional financing or capital.
Although we have credit facilities, we cannot be certain that our existing credit arrangements will provide all of the financing capacity that we will need in the future or that we will be able to change the credit facilities or revise covenants, if necessary, to accommodate changes or developments in our business and operations and/or increased working capital needs. In addition, if we do not comply with the covenants under our credit facility, our ability to borrow under that facility would be adversely affected. In addition, it is possible that counterparties to our financial agreements, including our credit facility and receivables factoring programs, may not be willing or able to meet their obligations, either due to instability in the global financial markets or otherwise, which could, among other impacts, increase the duration of our cash collection cycle. While we currently believe we have ample liquidity to manage the financial impact of current economic conditions, we can give no assurance that this will continue to be the case if the impact of current or worsening economic conditions is prolonged. 
Our future success may depend on our ability to obtain additional financing and capital to support possible future growth and future initiatives including additional investments in our business. In addition, we also have receivables factoring programs. Many of our borrowings are at variable interest rates and therefore our interest expense is subject to increase if rates increase. Persistent inflation, especially in Europe and the U.S., has led central banks to hold higher interest rates throughout fiscal 2024 to dampen inflation. These interest rates directly impact the amount of interest we pay on our variable rate obligations and continued or sustained increases in interest rates could negatively impact our business.
We may seek to raise capital by issuing additional common stock, other equity securities or debt securities, modifying our existing credit facilities or obtaining new facilities, or through a combination of these methods. We may not be able to obtain capital when we want or need it, particularly in light of ongoing volatility in the capital markets, and capital may not be available on satisfactory terms. If we issue additional equity securities or convertible securities to raise capital, it may be dilutive to shareholders’ ownership interests; we also may not be able to offer our securities on attractive or acceptable terms in the event of volatility or weakness in our stock price. Furthermore, any additional financing may have terms and conditions that adversely affect our business, such as restrictive financial or operating covenants, and our ability to meet any current or future financing covenants will largely depend on our financial performance, which in turn will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors.

Information Technology & Security Risk Management
Information security and data privacy risk management, including cybersecurity, is integrated into and aligns with our Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") processes. Our information protection and privacy program incorporates administrative, technical and physical safeguards, and incorporates various cybersecurity and internal control frameworks to protect information assets, manage data privacy and ensure compliance with laws and industry standards. We leverage the National Institute of Security and Technology ("NIST") Cybersecurity Framework ("CSF"), among others, to provide a strategic and adaptable approach to managing evolving cyber risks. This framework assists in assessing and improving our security posture by identifying vulnerabilities and prioritizing investments or improvements.
We maintain a cybersecurity incident response plan to assist in the assessment and management of cybersecurity incidents. The plan includes tactical playbooks and crisis response procedures based on incident severity and materiality impact. These crisis response procedures include escalation to the Audit Committee and the full Board of Directors, where appropriate. Our incident response plan is periodically tested through tabletop exercises, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.

Cybersecurity Governance & Oversight
Our Chief Information & Technology Officer ("CITO"), who reports directly to the President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), directs our global information technology vision and long-term strategies. Under the direction of the CITO, the Director of Cybersecurity leads our enterprise-wide cybersecurity program and oversees a dedicated global cybersecurity team that monitors, assesses and mitigates material risks from various cybersecurity threats. This team leads critical efforts to drive readiness, awareness and learning across the organization, including management of a 24x7x365 Cybersecurity Operations Center for detection and response capabilities; maintaining a cybersecurity awareness learning management system; and third party assessments and audits, penetration tests and "red team" assessments to evaluate the effectiveness of cybersecurity controls and identify areas of cybersecurity risk.
The Director of Cybersecurity is a seasoned cybersecurity expert with over 18 years of cybersecurity experience combined within the United States Department of Defense and Electronic Manufacturing Services industry. The Company's Director of Cybersecurity holds industry-recognized cybersecurity certifications, a Bachelor of Science degree in Cybersecurity and a Master of Science degree in Cybersecurity Management and Policy.
Our executive-level Security Steering Committee provides oversight of cybersecurity, data governance and privacy programs. This Committee is made up of select executives including the General Counsel, Chief Administrative Officer and Secretary ("CAO"); Chief Operating Officer; and CITO. The Security Steering Committee provides oversight and ensures program alignment to Plexus' strategic goals. The committee serves to provide awareness and guidance to prioritization, organizational alignment and enablement of resources to minimize risk to Plexus' operations, brand and reputation. The Security Steering Committee, through the Director of Cybersecurity and the CITO, reports to a broader Information Technology ("IT") Steering Committee, which includes the President and CEO and Chief Financial Officer. 
On at least an annual basis, and on topical information security matters more frequently as determined by the Board of Directors or management, the Audit Committee reviews the effectiveness of IT risk governance and management, including those relating to business continuity, cybersecurity, malware, regulatory compliance and data management. These reviews also include reviewing the appropriateness of resources (people and financial) devoted to information technology requirements. The CITO and Director of Cybersecurity also brief the Audit Committee quarterly on cybersecurity matters, including specific risks, mitigation plans, risk management and governance. The Audit Committee reports to the full Board of Directors on these discussions as appropriate. 
Further, the Board of Directors is briefed periodically (at least annually) on our overall IT strategy, including cybersecurity, to ensure alignment with the business,  review of assets and infrastructure, and trends, key risks and initiatives.
Impact of Cybersecurity Threats
As of the date of this report, we believe that risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have not or are not reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results from operations, or financial condition. Despite our cybersecurity measures, there can be no assurance that we, or the third-parties we interact with, will not experience a cybersecurity incident in the future that will materially affect us. As part of our overall risk mitigation strategy, we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks; however, such insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to cybersecurity breaches, cyberattacks, and other related breaches. Refer to the discussion in "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A herein for further details on cybersecurity and information technology risks that could adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial conditions.
