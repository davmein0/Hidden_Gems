ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
At Plexus, we help create the products that build a better world. Driven by a passion for excellence, we partner with our customers to design, manufacture and service highly complex products in demanding regulatory environments. From life-saving medical devices and mission-critical aerospace and defense products to industrial automation systems and semiconductor capital equipment, our innovative solutions across the lifecycle of a product converge where advanced technology and human impact intersect. We provide these solutions to market-leading as well as disruptive global companies in the Aerospace/Defense, Healthcare/Life Sciences, and Industrial sectors, supported by a global team of over 20,000 members across our 26 facilities in the Americas ("AMER"), Asia-Pacific ("APAC") and Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") regions.    
Our Vision, Mission and Strategy
Our vision is to help create the products that build a better world. Our mission is to be the leader in highly complex products and demanding regulatory environments. Our strategy to fulfill our vision and mission is consistent and can be summarized in four parts:  
•
Market Focus
 – We engineer innovative solutions for customers in growth markets featuring highly complex products and demanding regulatory environments.
•
Superior Execution –
 We are dedicated partners to our customers, committed to achieving zero defects and perfect delivery through operational excellence. 
•
Passion Meets Purpose
 – We are united as a team.  We are guided by our values. We do the right thing to support our team members, communities and customers. 
•
Discipline by Design
 – We hold ourselves accountable to delivering shareholder value through consistent application of a disciplined financial model.  
Built on a foundation of innovation, we are relentless in our pursuit of excellence, aligning our team members, operations, systems of oversight and financial metrics to create a high performance, accountable organization with an engaged workforce deeply passionate about helping to create the products that build a better world. 
Financial Model 
Our financial model aligns with our business strategy. Our primary long-term goal is to achieve a 9-12% compounded annual revenue growth rate while earning a return on invested capital ("ROIC") of 15%, which would significantly exceed our weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") and represent positive economic return. Economic return is the amount by which our ROIC exceeds our WACC, and we believe it is a fundamental driver of shareholder value. We review our internal calculation of WACC annually; for fiscal 2024, our WACC was 8.2%. 
For more information regarding ROIC and economic return, which are non-GAAP financial measures, refer to "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition - Results of Operations - Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") and economic return" in Part II, Item 7. For additional information on our use of non-GAAP financial measures, see Exhibit 99.1 to this annual report on Form 10-K, which exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.

 – Our approach to manufacturing focuses on innovation, continuous improvement and superior quality and delivery. With a global footprint and scalable operations, we aim to tailor our manufacturing environment to meet each customer’s needs worldwide. As we strive for perfect delivery and zero defects, exceptional quality begins with each individual member of our team, which we advance through our Quality Begins with Me program. Our capabilities and our commitment to superior execution position us to support the complex technology and regulatory needs of the industries we serve, providing customers with dependable and flexible manufacturing solutions.
•
Sustaining Services
 –

We are committed to protecting our customers' brand reputation, supporting the success of each product in the market and extending a product's useful life through repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing (at the direction of our customers) and service parts planning. From influencing a product's design for serviceability, which creates early access for lifecycle extension services and repair, to aftermarket and end-of-life treatment, such as spare parts management, depot repair and part recovery services, we take a proactive and circular approach to service to help keep products in the market. 
Through these integrated solutions, we proactively tackle tough challenges throughout the product lifecycle. We provide most of our solutions on a turnkey basis, under which we procure and warehouse all materials required for product assembly. We provide select solutions on a consignment basis, meaning our customers supply the necessary materials, while Plexus provides the labor and other services required for product assembly. Other than certain test equipment, manufacturing equipment and software used for internal operations, we do not design or manufacture our own proprietary products.
Operations 
Plexus is a Wisconsin-headquartered corporation operating from 26 active facilities, totaling approximately 5.0 million square feet. Our facilities are strategically located to support the design, manufacturing and service needs of customers' global supply chains in our targeted market sectors.
Customers and Market Sectors Served
We specialize in serving customers in the Aerospace/Defense, Healthcare/Life Sciences, and Industrial market sectors. Plexus serves a diverse customer landscape that includes industry-leading, branded product companies, along with other technology pioneering start-ups and emerging companies that may or may not maintain manufacturing capabilities. During fiscal 2024, we served approximately 190 customers. No customer accounted for over 10% of our sales in fiscal 2024. GE Healthcare Technologies, Inc. ("GEHC") accounted for 10.3% of our net sales during fiscal 2023, while General Electric ("GE") accounted for 12.9% of our net sales during fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2023, GE completed the separation of its healthcare business, GEHC, as a stand-alone company. No other customer accounted for 10.0% or more of our net sales in any of the last three fiscal years. Many of our large customers, including GEHC and GE, contract with us through multiple independent divisions, subsidiaries, production facilities or locations. We believe that in most cases our sales to any one such division, subsidiary, facility or location are independent of sales to others.
The distribution of our net sales by market sectors for the indicated fiscal years is shown in the following table:

Although our current business development focus is based on our targeted market sectors of Aerospace/Defense, Healthcare/Life Sciences, and Industrial, we evaluate our financial performance and allocate our resources geographically (see Note 11 "Reportable Segments, Geographic Information and Major Customers" in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding our reportable segments). Plexus offers an array of solutions for customers in each market sector and, aside from the specific go-to-market teams, generally we do not dedicate operational equipment, personnel, facilities or other resources to particular market sectors, nor do we internally track our costs and resources per market sector.

Go-to-Market Strategy
Each market sector has a market sector vice president, as well as market sector senior director roles, who together oversee and provide leadership to business development and customer management teams, supply chain, engineering and manufacturing subject matter experts and market sector specialists. These teams maintain expertise related to each market sector and execute sector strategies aligned to that market’s unique delivery, quality and regulatory requirements.
Our market sector teams help to develop Plexus’ strategy for growth with a particular emphasis on expanding the value-add solutions we offer customers. Our sales and marketing efforts focus on expanding our engagements with existing customers as well as targeting new customers. 
Materials and Suppliers
We typically purchase raw materials, including printed circuit boards and electronic components, from a wide variety of manufacturers and their authorized distributors. Under certain circumstances, we will purchase materials from independent distributors, customers or competitors. Many of these raw materials are unique to the designed assembly. By customer agreement, we purchase materials according to customer forecast and supplier lead-times. 
The key electronic components we purchase include: advanced semiconductors, diodes, power management modules, microcontrollers, memory modules, interconnects, inductors, resistors, capacitors, power supplies and cable and wire. Volatile demand (in quantity or mix), material shortages, extended lead-times and subsequent allocations by our suppliers are an inherent risk within the electronics industry and have remained an issue, particularly for semiconductors during fiscal 2024. We discuss the causes, implications, and potential implications of volatile demand and material shortages more fully in "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A herein. 
We also purchase non-electronic, typically custom engineered components such as molded/formed plastics, sheet metal fabrications, aluminum extrusions, robotics, motors, vision sensors, motion/actuation, fluidics, displays, die castings and various other hardware and fastener components. These materials are sourced from Plexus' preferred suppliers and customer directed suppliers. Altogether, purchased materials range from “off the shelf” to highly customized and vary widely in terms of market availability and price. Through our engineering product development engagements and through the quoting of new business, Plexus can influence the selection of new product materials, and therefore the selection of suppliers who outperform their peers.  
Amidst a highly dynamic set of supply markets, Plexus' global supply chain management organization works to mitigate potential risks and ensure a steady flow of materials at competitive prices. We pursue these goals through supply chain solutions developed in collaboration with our customers and our suppliers, a commitment to strong supplier partnerships, use of proprietary risk management tools and aggressive management of supplier commitments. 
Competition
Plexus operates in a highly competitive market, with a goal to be best-in-class at meeting the unique needs of our customers. A number of competitors may provide services similar to Plexus. Others may be more established in certain industry sectors, or have greater financial, manufacturing or marketing resources. Smaller competitors compete mainly in specific sectors and within limited geographic areas. Plexus also competes with in-house capabilities of current and potential customers. Plexus maintains awareness and knowledge of our competitors' capabilities in order to remain highly competitive within our target markets. Refer to the discussion in "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A herein for further details on market competition.
We believe our ability to provide a full range of services that complement the entire product lifecycle across a global footprint provides a business advantage. Relative to our competition, overriding factors such as lower manufacturing volumes, production flexibility, unique fulfillment requirements and complex regulatory and quality requirements typically result in higher investments in inventory and selling and administrative costs for us. The cost variance from our competitors is especially evident relative to those that provide electronics manufacturing services for high-volume, less complex products, with less stringent requirements (e.g., consumer electronics).
Sustainability & Social Impact
Our vision is to help create the products that build a better world, yet the opportunity and responsibility we have to build a better world goes far beyond the products we help to create. We are committed to elevating the standards of business conduct through the integration of sustainable and responsible business practices into our enduring strategy. This integrated approach and related goals enable us to address important environmental and social issues material to the long-term success of our business. This commitment is made public through our membership with organizations such as the U.N. Global Compact ("UNGC"), including alignment to the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, and the Responsible Business Alliance ("RBA").

Table of Contents
In service to our vision, we continue to evolve our solutions to better service our customers in light of changing market demands. This includes the opportunity we have to help deliver more sustainable and responsible products to the market. We continue to expand our product lifecycle capabilities in response to this heightened focus, as we seek to design more environmentally sustainable products, improve our production practices, assess and deploy product life extension and part recovery strategies, and enable a more sustainable, responsible supply chain for our customers. In 2024, we were a finalist in Scotland's Centre for Engineering, Education & Development's "Net Zero Hero" award for our product lifecycle assessment services. These services help our customers estimate and uncover factors that may impact the global warming potential of their products.  
We are focused on our own operational impact, as well, seeking to reduce our emissions, waste, water and use of natural resources, transition to renewable energy and reusable resources, and optimize our operations through adoption of new technologies and automation. Our commitment to reducing our environmental impact is captured in our Climate Policy, which helps to guide our objectives and offers structure to aid in prioritizing our efforts.

In fiscal 2024, we pursued a third consecutive year-over-year emissions intensity reduction goal, achieving an absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reduction following two consecutive years of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity reductions across our global operations. Further in fiscal 2024, we participated in the UNGC's Climate Ambition Accelerator program as we seek to advance our energy transition strategy and develop longer-term aspirations in support of international climate initiatives. 
Beyond our four walls, we seek to collaborate and integrate with our local communities and find opportunities to partner throughout our value chain. Community involvement, volunteering and charitable giving are important to ensure we are investing and promoting positive impacts in the communities in which we operate and where our team members live. Within each community where we have a physical location, we provide donations to local charities that enhance innovation, promote technology-related educational programs (e.g., STEM) and preserve the quality of life. Plexus also offers eight hours of paid, volunteer time off for team members who want to give back through community engagement events. In addition to local impacts realized through our team member volunteer efforts, the Plexus Community Foundation donated nearly $1.1 million in fiscal 2024, bringing its total giving to $11.0 million since 2004.
We are committed to driving greater transparency around our sustainable and responsible business practices through the publication of an annual sustainability report. More detailed information about Plexus’ efforts and progress can be found in that report located at https://www.plexus.com/en-us/corporate-social-responsibility. The information in the sustainability report and on Plexus’ website is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated by reference.
Refer to the discussion in "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A herein for further details of environmental physical and transition risks, as well as the legal and regulatory landscape related to environmental matters, including climate change, that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Human Capital Management 
People are the heart of what we do and who we are. How we engage and empower our team members is critical to how we deliver value and create sustained growth for our shareholders. We realize our success depends on the well-being and inclusive engagement of each individual on our team. As a responsible employer, we are committed to global standards of employment, which we effect through our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics ("Code of Conduct"), our Human Rights Policy and other labor and employment policies and through our commitment to the UNGC Sustainable Development Goals and the RBA. We also realize in order to attract and retain talented individuals we must provide our team members the ability to do meaningful work, personally and professionally develop, and create diverse and memorable experiences.

Purpose and Culture
We recognize a great culture is foundational to the success of our vision to help create the products that build a better world. We are proud of our culture and the recognition we have received over the years as a great place to work. In 2024, HR Asia awarded Plexus the Best Company to Work for in Asia (Malaysia Chapter), as well as the HR Asia Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion Award. In building a great culture, we embrace our five values:
•
Growing our People 
– We foster a culture of trust, courage and growth, empowering every team member to realize their full potential. 
•
Building Belonging
 – We build an inclusive environment, valuing each team member, embracing diversity and promoting teamwork to achieve extraordinary outcomes together. 
•
Innovating Responsibly
 – We innovate and leverage technology, guided by a clear strategy, to boldly drive positive change and promote a sustainable future.
•
Delivering Excellence
 – We commit to exceptional quality and perfect delivery by standardizing, scaling and continuously improving.  
•
Creating Customer Success
 – We exceed customer expectations and forge relationships built on trust, candor and shared successes.
Commitment to Our Values and Ethical Business Practices
Along with our values, we act in accordance with our Code of Conduct, which creates expectations and provides guidance for all team members, representatives and partners of Plexus to make the right decisions. Our Code of Conduct includes topics such as corruption, discrimination, harassment, privacy, appropriate use of company assets, protecting confidential information and reporting Code of Conduct violations. It is used to reinforce our passion for operating in a fair, honest, responsible and ethical manner and articulates our responsibilities as a trusted leader in the business community. The Code of Conduct also emphasizes the importance of having an inclusive, welcoming environment in which all team members feel empowered to do what is right and are expected to voice concerns should violations of the Code of Conduct be observed. All team members are required to complete training on the Code of Conduct biennially.
Our commitment to being a responsible employer is reinforced through our membership with the RBA. Since 2014, our RBA membership reinforces the critical business standards required of Plexus, our team members and business partners related to human rights, environmental, health and safety, labor and business ethics. As an active member of RBA, we abide by their global standards, which may exceed minimum legal requirements, regarding the treatment of workers. Being a member of the RBA means we help collectively influence our broader business ecosystem by propagating and maintaining sustainable and responsible business practices. 
Human Rights
At the core of our value system is a fundamental respect for human rights. Our Human Rights Policy formalizes Plexus' commitment to respect human rights and embodies internationally-recognized principles and the laws of the countries in which we operate. 
We prohibit discrimination and harassment, recruiting fees imposed on our workers, the use of child labor, forced labor or labor that results from human trafficking, and the unreasonable restriction of movement or travel of workers. We support reasonable working hours and time off, fair wages, access to basic liberties (including clean sanitation facilities and potable water), freedom of association, the humane treatment of all workers and fair and honest business practices. Our Human Rights Policy supports the RBA Code of Conduct labor standards framework, and reinforces our statement in support of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and the UK Modern Slavery Act. Our Human Rights Policy was created by a cross-functional team appointed to conduct regular policy and impact mapping, as outlined by the UNGC, to facilitate continuous improvement and commitment to our standards. 
Talent Development & Acquisition
With people at the heart of what we do and who we are, we create, implement and accelerate development opportunities for our team members in order to enable business growth, enhance our culture, drive leadership accountability and inspire purposeful engagement. Our commitment to holistic talent management means that we expect and reward high performance and address underperformance with urgency, candor and empathy. We engage in regular talent reviews to calibrate on the performance and potential of our teammates, development opportunities, career pathing and the strength of our succession plans. During these reviews, we also assess retention rates and the diversity composition of our leaders and leadership pipeline. Competency-based training, leadership development programs and online learning promote a learning culture and provide ongoing development for team members at all levels. We also have established a formal mentoring program that aids in the development and retention of

talent. While our goal is to develop our own talent, we recruit new graduate and experienced talent by valuing potential and personality traits that align with our values, as well as direct and transferable experiences.
Employee Engagement
At every facility, in every region and at all levels, we strive to continuously improve the engagement of our team members.  We survey employee engagement annually through our employee net promoter score and we identify strengths and act on areas of opportunity to enhance our work environment and increase employee satisfaction. In 2024, we received responses from 100% of our team members through the survey resulting in an industry leading net promoter score.
Diversity and Inclusion
At Plexus, diversity and inclusion ("D&I") does not simply mean representation. It means maximizing and optimizing the human experience and enabling access to the best possible talent for Plexus. We have adopted the following D&I statement at Plexus, which is directly incorporated into our Code of Conduct: 
"Our people create our best Plexus. Ingrained in our culture of inclusion is the philosophy that each individual offers diverse perspectives, backgrounds and experiences that create great outcomes when we are united as a team. We respect our people and embrace our differences. We welcome everyone and value the ideas generated by our collective uniqueness. We aspire that all of our people reach their full potential."
Our organizational approach to D&I at Plexus includes the following:
•
D&I Integration Plan
 – We have established defined actions aligned to value-driven outcomes as we further integrate diversity and inclusion into our strategy, business operations and culture. 
•
D&I Committee and Board Oversight
 – To oversee strategic objectives and to ensure appropriate accountabilities exist to support our efforts, D&I is incorporated into our executive Sustainable & Responsible Business Practices Committee, made up of key members of executive management, including our Chief Executive Officer. In addition, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of our Board of Directors reviews our human capital management strategy, including D&I initiatives and progress to cultivate an optimized workforce and inclusive culture.  
•
Employee Resource Groups
 – Our ERGs are voluntary, employee-driven, executive-sponsored groups organized around common interests and legitimate business purposes. Plexus' current ERGs include:
◦

Training
 – Plexus has invested in D&I leadership training on the value of diversity and how best to foster an inclusive culture, including trainings related to foundations of D&I, unconscious bias and hiring. 
•
Broadening our Talent Pool 
– Our talent acquisition teams continuously seek to widen the funnel of talent seeking to join Plexus. Efforts are customized by geography based on current workforce dynamics. This includes partnerships with organizations such as the Society of Women Engineering ("SWE"), Women in Electronics, and recruiting from new universities and industry groups across many disciplines. 
Employee Benefits & Programs
Plexus has a number of policies and benefits in place to support the unique needs and overall well-being of our team members and their families, including competitive health and welfare plans, a flexible workplace, paid parental leave and a Plexus wellness program to ensure our team members have access to the resources they need to lead healthy, balanced lives. For our team members, this includes access to our Employee Assistance Program ("EAP") - or similar program depending on the country of employment - that provides confidential support for stress management and mental health, including counseling and resources for team members and their households. In 2024, Plexus was proud to be recognized as one of the Greatest Workplaces for Mental Wellbeing by Newsweek magazine.
Compensation
We employ a "pay for performance" approach, emphasizing a direct correlation between performance and rewards and empowering team members to steer their own professional destinies. Leaders are provided with the flexibility to recognize exceptional individual contributions through customized elements of pay such as base salary, cash incentives and equity (company stock) compensation. Short and long-term incentive pay is designed to be competitive, improve employee retention, reward team members for performance supporting our strategic objectives and align team members with the interests of shareholders to deliver both short-term and long-term results. Approximately 20.4% and 3.0% of our team members participate in our short and long-term incentive programs, respectively. Further, we support financial well-being through external fiduciary advisors that can help team members with topics ranging from retirement investing and paying off debt to general money matters.
Our compensation guidelines and pay structures are adapted to reflect market dynamics and currency exchange rate fluctuations, ensuring alignment with regional trends, pay range segments and applicable experience. A risk assessment on our compensation plans and strategy is performed annually, including a market pay analysis to ensure we are competitive with local market practices where we operate. We provide the results of this risk assessment and a summary of all global total rewards programs to the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of our Board of Directors on an annual basis. These practices not only facilitate a clear and transparent understanding of our compensation philosophy among team members but also ensure internal fairness and external market competitiveness.
A pay equity tool was introduced within the United States in fiscal 2024 to automate our process for ensuring equity within our compensation framework and to allow for enhanced transparency with our team members. We will expand the usage of this tool outside the United States in fiscal 2025. This tool analyzes various factors such as job roles, job levels, qualifications, performance and industry benchmarks. Through the integration of this tool into our compensation process, we streamline and simplify our proactive approach to prevent pay disparities before they start.
Worker Health and Safety
Protecting our team and those within our communities is paramount as we strive to be the safest place for our team members outside of their home. We are committed to complying with applicable laws and take an adaptive and proactive approach to ensure we conduct all of our operations across the globe safely and responsibly. We maintain a method of evaluating environmental, health and safety ("EHS") performance for continual improvement and we are committed to providing a workplace that promotes the health and safety of all who walk through our doors. 
Our Corporate Policy for Quality, Environmental, Health & Safety and Social Responsibility Management sets forth our EHS policy statement, which includes our commitment to: maintain, evaluate and continuously improve our global EHS management system; provide processes for consultation and participation of team members to reduce safety risks; and maintain compliance with applicable environmental and occupational health and safety laws and other requirements. These requirements are related to topics such as: monitoring, tracking and reporting of air and water emissions; tracking and disposing of wastes generated from our manufacturing process; and evaluating and mitigating employee health and safety risks in our facilities.

Sixteen of our 17 manufacturing facilities are certified to ISO 14001 Environmental Management and three of 17 are certified to ISO 45001 Occupational Health and Safety Management standards. All of our manufacturing facilities, regardless of formal certification, abide by global policies and processes that align with both of these standards. Our facility in Kelso, Scotland is certified to the ISO 50001 Energy Management system, which requires the development and implementation of a comprehensive energy management system that helps the site achieve continual improvement of energy performance, including efficiency, security, use and consumption.
Our site teams are trained on these requirements and certifications to these standards are audited and renewed annually in alignment with ISO standards. Further, we provide education and training for every team member on important environmental and safety topics applicable to their role, leveraging a risk-based approach to training to ensure our team members have the knowledge they need to keep themselves and their peers safe and the environment healthy. To help drive best practices and enhance our environmental and safety performance, we employ a global team of over 50 EHS professionals who help to develop and deploy standard policies and procedures to protect our team members and to enable safe and sustainable operations. These roles are integrated into operational teams and process reviews to ensure appropriate consideration of potential safety concerns and environmental consequences of our operating procedures.
Human Capital Management Governance
Our Chief Human Resources Officer ("CHRO") directs our human capital management strategy and provides an update to the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of our Board of Directors quarterly. This update may include, among other topics, talent attraction, development and retention; succession planning, including successor candidates for key management roles; corporate culture; D&I; compensation practices; training; and progress to advance initiatives. Management also updates the Board of Directors regularly on employee-related policies, trends and efforts intended to protect our team members and to preserve our corporate culture, such as those related to EHS and Ethics Hotline reporting. 
Employee Data
Of our over 20,000 team members, 50.4% are female, 49.5% are male and 0.1% choose not to identify. The majority of our workforce, 56.8%, is located in our APAC region, while 29.6% and 13.6% of our team members are located in our AMER and EMEA regions, respectively. Approximately 240 of our team members in the United Kingdom are covered by union agreements. These union agreements are typically renewed at the beginning of each year, although in a few cases these agreements may last two or more years. Our global team members outside the United Kingdom are not covered by union agreements. We have no history of labor disputes at any of our facilities, and we believe that our employee relationships are positive and stable. Given the quick response times required by our customers, we seek to maintain flexibility to scale our operations as necessary to maximize efficiency. To do so, we use skilled temporary labor in addition to our full-time employees.
Intellectual Property
We own various service marks that we use in our business, which are registered in the trademark offices of the United States and other countries. We develop and maintain trade secrets but do not generally seek to protect trade secrets through patents. We do not have any material copyrights.
Information Technology
Our core solutions for manufacturing facilities include a single-instance enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system in addition to product data management and advanced planning and scheduling systems, along with consistent solutions for warehouse management and manufacturing execution that support our global operations. This consistency augments our other management information systems, allowing us to standardize the translation of data from multiple production facilities into operational and financial information required by the business. The related software licenses are of a general commercial character on terms customary for these types of agreements.
In addition to our core solutions, we are committed to investing in new platform technologies, such as advanced manufacturing execution systems, process automation, warehouse automation, artificial intelligence, realtime vision and anomaly detection systems and collaboration tools. These investments are aimed at enhancing productivity, optimizing operational efficiency, and driving differentiation in a competitive landscape. Refer to the discussion in "Cybersecurity" in Part I, Item 1C herein for details on our cybersecurity risk management strategy and governance.

Compliance with Laws and Regulations
As a global public company that designs, manufactures and services highly complex products in demanding regulatory environments, our operations are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and compliance obligations. We strive to implement robust internal controls, quality management systems and management systems of compliance that govern our internal actions and mitigate our risk of non-compliance. We also make efforts to identify non-compliance concerns through internal and external audits, risk assessments as well as an ethics hotline reporting system. Plexus is also committed to supporting product safety and environmental compliance regulations as may be required by our customers. This support may include customized operational processes or collecting data or compliance information on parts or production materials to meet certain laws, regulations or end market requirements, such as the Restrictions on Hazardous Substances ("RoHS") 2011/65/EU, Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment ("WEEE") 2012/19/EU directives and Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and restriction of Chemicals ("REACH") EC 1907/2006 EU directive.
