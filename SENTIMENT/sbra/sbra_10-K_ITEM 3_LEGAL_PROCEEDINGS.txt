PART II
ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
Stockholder Information 
Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC and trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “SBRA.”
At February 12, 2025, we had approximately 3,797 stockholders of record. 
We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 or issue any shares of our common stock in a transaction that was not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
To maintain REIT status, we are required each year to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income after certain adjustments. All distributions will be made by us at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements, debt covenants (which include limits on distributions by us), applicable law, and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant. For example, while the Senior Notes Indentures and the Credit Agreement permit us to declare and pay any dividend or make any distribution that is necessary to maintain our REIT status, those distributions are subject to certain financial tests under the Senior Notes Indentures, and therefore, the amount of cash distributions we can make to our stockholders may be limited.
Distributions with respect to our common stock can be characterized for federal income tax purposes as taxable ordinary dividends, which may be non-qualified, long-term capital gain, or qualified, non-dividend distributions (return of capital) or a combination thereof. Following is the characterization of our annual cash dividends on common stock per share:

ITEM 6. RESERVED
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The discussion below contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those which are discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Also see “Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” preceding Part I.
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. 
Our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is organized as follows:
•
Overview
•
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
•
Recently Issued Accounting Standards Updates
•
Results of Operations
•
Liquidity and Capital Resources
•
Concentration of Credit Risk
•
Skilled Nursing Facility Reimbursement Rates
Overview
We expect to grow our investment portfolio while diversifying our portfolio by tenant, facility type and geography within the healthcare sector. We plan to achieve these objectives primarily through making investments directly or indirectly in healthcare real estate, including the development of purpose-built healthcare facilities with select developers. We also intend to achieve our objective of diversifying our portfolio by tenant and facility type through select asset sales and other arrangements with our tenants.
Market Trends and Uncertainties
Our operations have been and are expected to continue to be impacted by economic and market conditions. Increases in interest rates, labor shortages, inflation and increased volatility in public equity and fixed income markets have led to increased costs and limited the availability of capital.
The above factors, together with the impact of COVID-19, have resulted in decreased occupancy and increased operating costs for our tenants and borrowers, which have negatively impacted their operating results and may adversely impact their ability to make full and timely rental payments and debt service payments, respectively, to us. Our Senior Housing - Managed portfolio has been similarly impacted, and we expect that decreased occupancy and increased operating costs will continue to negatively impact the operating results of these investments. While our tenants, borrowers and Senior Housing - Managed portfolio have experienced increases in occupancy, certain of those occupancy rates are still below pre-pandemic levels. On the labor front, our tenants, borrowers and Senior Housing - Managed portfolio have significantly reduced their reliance on agency staffing, which was a mainstay in the wake of COVID-19, and while they continue to experience improvements in both permanent labor availability and overall costs from the worst point of the pandemic, permanent labor supply remains lower and costs remain higher than pre-pandemic levels. We are, however, encouraged by increases our tenants are receiving in reimbursement rates in our skilled nursing/transitional care portfolio, as those increases have led to margin recovery despite occupancy being below pre-pandemic levels.
 In some cases, we may have to restructure or temporarily defer tenants’ long-term rent obligations and may not be able to do so on terms that are as favorable to us as those currently in place. Reduced or modified rental and debt service amounts could result in the determination that the full amounts of our investments are not recoverable, which could result in an impairment charge. If our tenants and borrowers default on these obligations, such defaults could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity, in addition to resulting in potential impairment charges. Further, prolonged deterioration in the operating results for our investments in our Senior Housing - Managed portfolio could result in the determination that the full amounts of our investments are not recoverable, which could result in an impairment charge.
We regularly monitor the effects of economic and market conditions on our operations and financial position, as well as on the operations and financial position of our tenants and borrowers, in order to respond and adapt to the ongoing changes in 
33
our operating environment. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional discussion of these risks, as well as the uncertainties we and our tenants and borrowers may face as a result.
Acquisitions
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we acquired three Senior Housing - Managed communities and one Senior Housing - Leased community for aggregate consideration of $136.4 million, including acquisition costs. See Note 3, “Recent Real Estate Acquisitions (Consolidated),” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these acquisitions.
Dispositions 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we completed the sale of 17 skilled nursing/transitional care facilities and one behavioral health facility for aggregate consideration, net of closing costs, of $96.0 million. The net carrying value of the assets and liabilities of these facilities was $93.9 million, which resulted in an aggregate $2.1 million net gain on sale. We continue to evaluate additional assets for sale as part of our initiative to recycle capital and further improve our portfolio quality.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments and assumptions, require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. For more information regarding our critical accounting policies, see Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Variable Interest Entities
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to identify entities for which control is achieved through voting rights or other means and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (“VIEs”). A VIE is broadly defined as an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about the entity’s activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests, and substantially all of the entity’s activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. If we were determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we would consolidate investments in the VIE. We may change our original assessment of a VIE due to events such as modifications of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity’s equity investments at risk and the disposal of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary.
We identify the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both: (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could be significant to the entity. We perform this analysis on an ongoing basis.
As it relates to investments in loans, in addition to our assessment of VIEs and whether we are the primary beneficiary of those VIEs, we evaluate the loan terms and other pertinent facts to determine whether the loan investment should be accounted for as a loan or as a real estate joint venture. If an investment has the characteristics of a real estate joint venture, including if we participate in the majority of the borrower’s expected residual profit, we would account for the investment as an investment in a real estate joint venture and not as a loan investment. Expected residual profit is defined as the amount of profit, whether called interest or another name, such as an equity kicker, above a reasonable amount of interest and fees expected to be earned by a lender.
As it relates to investments in joint ventures, we assess any partners’ rights and their impact on the presumption of control of the partnership by any single partner. We also apply this guidance to managing member interests in limited liability companies. We reassess our determination of which entity controls the joint venture if: there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of any partners or members, the general partner or managing member increases or decreases its ownership interests, or there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding ownership interests.

Real Estate Investments and Rental Revenue Recognition
Real Estate Acquisition Valuation
All assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition of real estate accounted for as a business combination are measured at their acquisition date fair values. For acquisitions of real estate accounted for as an asset acquisition, the fair value of consideration transferred by us (including transaction costs) is allocated to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. Tangible assets consist primarily of land, building and improvements. Identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of the above market component of in-place leases, tenant origination and absorption costs and tenant relationship intangibles, and identifiable intangible liabilities primarily consist of the below market component of in-place leases. Acquisition costs associated with real estate acquisitions deemed asset acquisitions are capitalized, and costs associated with real estate acquisitions deemed business combinations are expensed as incurred.
Estimates of the fair values of the tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities require us to make significant assumptions to estimate market lease rates, property operating expenses, carrying costs during lease-up periods, discount rates, market absorption periods, and the number of years the property will be held for investment. We make our best estimate based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease. The use of inappropriate assumptions would result in an incorrect valuation of our acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities, which would impact the amount of our net income.
Impairment of Real Estate Investments 
We regularly monitor events and changes in circumstances, including investment operating performance and general market conditions, that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our real estate investments may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate investments may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability by estimating whether we will recover the carrying value of our real estate investments through the undiscounted future cash flows and the eventual disposition of the investment. In some instances, there may be various potential outcomes for an investment and its potential undiscounted future cash flows. In these instances, the undiscounted future cash flows models used to assess recoverability are based on several assumptions and are probability-weighted based on our best estimates as of the date of evaluation. These assumptions include, among others, market rent, revenue and expense growth rates, absorption period, stabilized occupancy, holding period, market capitalization rates, and estimated market values based on analysis of letters of intent, purchase and sale agreements and recent sales data for comparable properties. When discounted cash flow is used to determine fair value, a discount rate assumption is also used. The assumptions are generally based on management’s experience in its local real estate markets, and the effects of current market conditions, which are subject to economic and market uncertainties. If, based on this analysis, we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of our real estate investments, we would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of our real estate investments. We determine estimated fair value based primarily upon (i) estimated sale prices from signed contracts or letters of intent from third-party offers, (ii) discounted cash flow models of the investment over its remaining hold period, (iii) third-party appraisals and (iv) recent sales data for comparable properties.
Revenue Recognition 
We recognize rental revenue from tenants, including rental abatements, lease incentives and contractual fixed increases attributable to operating leases, on a straight-line basis over the term of the related leases when it is probable that substantially all rents over the life of a lease are collectible. Certain of our leases provide for contingent rents equal to a percentage of the facility’s revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the applicable base amount or other threshold. 
We assess the collectability of rents on a lease-by-lease basis, and in doing so, consider such things as historical bad debts, tenant creditworthiness, current economic trends, facility operating performance, lease structure, credit enhancements (including guarantees), current developments relevant to a tenant’s business specifically and to its business category generally, and changes in tenants’ payment patterns. Our assessment includes an estimation of a tenant’s ability to fulfill all of its rental obligations over the remaining lease term. In addition, with respect to tenants in bankruptcy, management makes estimates of the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims in assessing the estimated collectability of the related receivable. If at any time we cannot determine that it is probable that substantially all rents over the life of a lease are collectible, rental revenue will be recognized only to the extent of payments received, and all receivables associated with the lease will be written off irrespective of amounts expected to be collectible. Any recoveries of these amounts will be recorded in future periods upon receipt of payment. Write-offs of receivables and any recoveries of previously written-off receivables are recorded as adjustments to rental revenue.
35
Revenue from resident fees and services is recorded monthly as services are provided and includes resident room and care charges, ancillary services charges and other resident charges.
Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
We report investments in unconsolidated entities over whose operating and financial policies we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our consolidated statements of income (loss). The initial carrying value of the investment is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest. Differences between our cost basis and the basis reflected at the joint venture level are generally amortized over the lives of the related assets and liabilities, and such amortization is included in our share of earnings of the joint venture. In addition, distributions received from unconsolidated entities are classified based on the nature of the activity or activities that generated the distribution.
We regularly monitor events and changes in circumstances, including investment operating performance, changes in anticipated holding period and general market conditions, that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our equity method investments may be impaired. An equity method investment’s value is impaired when the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value and we determine the decline in value is other-than-temporary. The fair value is estimated based on discounted cash flows models that include all estimated cash inflows and outflows and any estimated debt premiums or discounts. The discounted cash flows are based on several assumptions, including management fee, absorption period, terminal capitalization rates, revenue and expense per bed, revenue and expense growth percentage, replacement reserve per unit, stabilized occupancy, stabilized operating margin, price per bed and discount rates. The assumptions are generally based on management’s experience in its local real estate markets, and the effects of current market conditions, which are subject to economic and market uncertainties. If we believe that there is an other-than-temporary decline in the value of an equity method investment, we would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of such equity method investment.
Loans Receivable and Credit Losses
Loans Receivable
Loans receivable are reflected at amortized cost on our consolidated balance sheets. The amortized cost of a loan receivable is the outstanding unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized discounts, costs and fees directly associated with the origination of the loan.
Loans acquired in connection with a business combination are recorded at their acquisition date fair value. We determine the fair value of loans receivable based on estimates of expected discounted cash flows, collateral, credit risk and other factors.  A valuation allowance is not established at the acquisition date, as the amount of estimated future cash flows reflects our judgment regarding their uncertainty. The difference between the acquisition date fair value and the total expected cash flows is recognized as interest income using the effective interest method over the life of the applicable loan. Any unamortized balances are immediately recognized in income if the loan is repaid before its contractual maturity.
Interest income on our loans receivable is recognized on an accrual basis over the life of the investment using the interest method. Direct loan origination costs are amortized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to interest income. When concerns exist as to the ultimate collection of principal or interest due under a loan, the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, and we will not recognize interest income until the cash is received, or the loan returns to accrual status. If we determine that the collection of interest according to the contractual terms of the loan or through the receipts of assets in satisfaction of contractual amounts due is probable, we will resume the accrual of interest. In instances where borrowers are in default under the terms of their loans, we may continue recognizing interest income provided that all amounts owed under the contractual terms of the loan, including accrued and unpaid interest, do not exceed the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell.
On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the collectability of our interest income receivable and establish a reserve for amounts not expected to be collected. Our evaluation includes reviewing credit quality indicators such as payment status, changes affecting the operations of the facilities securing the loans, and national and regional economic factors. The reserve is a valuation allowance that reflects management’s estimate of losses inherent in the interest income receivable balance as of the balance sheet date. The reserve is adjusted through provision for loan losses and other reserves on our consolidated statements of income (loss) and is decreased by charge-offs to specific receivables.
Credit Losses
On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the portion of unfunded loan commitments expected to be funded, and establish an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is calculated 
36
using the related amortization schedules, payment histories and loan-to-value ratios. The following rates are applied to determine the aggregate expected losses, which is recorded as the allowance for credit losses: (i) a default rate, (ii) a liquidation cost rate and (iii) a distressed property reduction rate. If no loan-to-value ratio is available, a loss severity rate is applied in place of the liquidation cost rate and the distressed property reduction rate. The default rate is based on average charge-off and delinquency rates from the Federal Reserve, and the other rates are based on industry research and historical performance of a similar portfolio of financial assets. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance that reflects management’s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The reserve is adjusted through provision for loan losses and other reserves on our consolidated statements of income (loss) and is decreased by charge-offs to specific loans.
Preferred Equity Investments and Preferred Return
Preferred equity investments are accounted for at unreturned capital contributions, plus accrued and unpaid preferred returns. We recognize preferred return income on a monthly basis based on the outstanding investment including any previously accrued and unpaid return. As a preferred member of the preferred equity joint ventures in which we participate, we are not entitled to share in the joint venture’s earnings or losses. Rather, we are entitled to receive a preferred return, which is deferred if the cash flow of the joint venture is insufficient to currently pay the accrued preferred return.
We regularly monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our preferred equity investments may not be recoverable or realized. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate our preferred equity investments for impairment based on a comparison of the fair value of the investment to its carrying value. The fair value is estimated based on discounted cash flows that include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period. If, based on this analysis, we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of our preferred equity investment, we would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of our preferred equity investment.
Income Taxes
We elected to be treated as a REIT with the filing of our U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year beginning January 1, 2011. We believe that we have been organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, in a manner to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction or net capital gains and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT. 
As a result of certain investments, we record income tax expense or benefit with respect to certain of our entities that are taxed as taxable REIT subsidiaries under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations and not under the REIT provisions.
We account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method and recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Any increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes a change in our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events, is included in the tax provision when such changes occur. Deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset, is included in the tax provision when such changes occur.
We evaluate our tax positions using a two-step approach: step one (recognition) occurs when we conclude that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, and step two (measurement) is only addressed if step one has been satisfied (i.e., the position is more likely than not to be sustained). Under step two, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit (determined on a cumulative probability basis) that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We will recognize tax penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits as additional tax expense. 
37
Fair Value Measurements 
Under GAAP, we are required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, we are required to measure other financial instruments and balances at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired loans receivable and long-lived assets). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 
•
Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities; 
•
Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and 
•
Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 
When available, we utilize quoted market prices from an independent third-party source to determine fair value and classify such items in Level 1 or Level 2. In instances where the market for a financial instrument is not active, regardless of the availability of a nonbinding quoted market price, observable inputs might not be relevant and could require us to make a significant adjustment to derive a fair value measurement. Additionally, in an inactive market, a market price quoted from an independent third party may rely more on models with inputs based on information available only to that independent third party. When we determine the market for a financial instrument owned by us to be illiquid or when market transactions for similar instruments do not appear orderly, we may use several valuation sources (including internal valuations, discounted cash flow analysis and quoted market prices) to establish a fair value. If more than one valuation source is used, we will assign weights to the various valuation sources. Additionally, when determining the fair value of liabilities in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available, we measure fair value using (i) a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets or (ii) another valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of fair value measurement, such as the income approach or the market approach. 
Changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values. In this regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument. 
We consider the following factors to be indicators of an inactive market: (i) there are few recent transactions, (ii) price quotations are not based on current information, (iii) price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers (for example, some brokered markets), (iv) indexes that previously were highly correlated with the fair values of the asset or liability are demonstrably uncorrelated with recent indications of fair value for that asset or liability, (v) there is a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums, yields, or performance indicators (such as delinquency rates or loss severities) for observed transactions or quoted prices when compared with our estimate of expected cash flows, considering all available market data about credit and other nonperformance risk for the asset or liability, (vi) there is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the bid-ask spread, (vii) there is a significant decline or absence of a market for new issuances (that is, a primary market) for the asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities, and (viii) little information is released publicly (for example, a principal-to-principal market). 
We consider the following factors to be indicators of non-orderly transactions: (i) there was not adequate exposure to the market for a period before the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets or liabilities under current market conditions, (ii) there was a usual and customary marketing period, but the seller marketed the asset or liability to a single market participant, (iii) the seller is in or near bankruptcy or receivership (that is, distressed), or the seller was required to sell to meet regulatory or legal requirements (that is, forced), and (iv) the transaction price is an outlier when compared with other recent transactions for the same or similar assets or liabilities.

Results of Operations
As of December 31, 2024, our investment portfolio consisted of 364 real estate properties held for investment, 14 investments in loans receivable, five preferred equity investments and two investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. As of December 31, 2023, our investment portfolio consisted of 378 real estate properties held for investment, 14 investments in loans receivable, five preferred equity investments and two investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. In general, we expect that income and expenses related to our portfolio will fluctuate in future periods in comparison to the corresponding prior periods as a result of investment and disposition activity and anticipated future changes in our portfolio. The results of operations presented are not directly comparable due to ongoing acquisition and disposition activity, including our capital recycling initiative.
A discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 is included in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Comparison of results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022” section in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Represents the dollar amount increase (decrease) for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 that is not a direct result of investments/dispositions made after January 1, 2023. 
Rental and Related Revenues
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $381.5 million of rental income compared to $376.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The $5.2 million net increase in rental income is related to (i) a $6.8 million net increase in rental and related revenues related to leases that are no longer accounted for on an accrual basis, (ii) a $6.2 million increase from properties acquired after January 1, 2023, (iii) a $2.4 million increase due to incremental revenue related to capital expenditures, (iv) a $2.2 million increase due to lease amendments and annual rental increases based on changes in the Consumer Price Index and (v) a $1.6 million increase from properties that were transitioned to new operators. These increases are partially offset by (i) an $8.5 million decrease from properties disposed of after January 1, 2023, (ii) a $2.9 million increase in cash and non-cash rent receivable write-offs related to leases that are no longer accounted for on an accr
ual basis, (iii)
 a $1.1 million decrease in Genesis excess rents in accordance with the terms of the memorandum of understanding entered into with 
39
Genesis in 2017 and (iv) a $1.1 million decrease from facilities transitioned from triple-net leases to Senior Housing - Managed communities.
Our reported rental and related revenues may be subject to increased variability in the future as a result of lease accounting standards. If at any time we cannot determine that it is probable that substantially all rents over the life of a lease are collectible, rental revenue will be recognized only to the extent of payments received and all receivables associated with the lease will be written off, irrespective of amounts expected to be collectible. However, there can be no assurances regarding the timing and amount of these revenues. Amounts due under the terms of all of our lease agreements are subject to contractual increases, and contingent rental income may be derived from certain lease agreements. No material contingent rental income was derived during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Our rental income in future years will be impacted by changes in inflation. Certain of our lease agreements provide for an annual rent escalator based on the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (but not less than zero), subject to minimum or maximum fixed percentages that range from 1.0% to 5.0%.
Resident Fees and Services
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $284.6 million of resident fees and services compared to $236.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The $48.4 million net increase is due to 
(i) a $21.8 million increase related to seven facilities that were transitioned to Senior Housing - Managed communities after 
January 1, 2023
, (ii) a $15.1 million increase related to increased occupancy and an increase in rates and (iii) an $11.9 million increase from four Senior Housing - Managed communities acquired after 
January 1, 2023
. 
These increases are partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease related to one Senior Housing - Managed community disposed of after January 1, 2023.
Interest and Other Income
Interest and other income primarily consists of income earned on our loans receivable investments and preferred returns earned on our preferred equity investments. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $37.2 million of interest and other income compared to $35.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The net increase of $2.1 million is due to (i) a $1.5 million increase from investments made after January 1, 2023, (ii) a $0.7 million increase due to increased fundings for existing investments, (iii) a $0.4 million increase in bank interest income and (iv) a $0.2 million lease termination payment primarily related to one skilled nursing/transitional care facility that was sold during 2024, partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in income from investments repaid after January 1, 2023.
Depreciation and Amortization
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $169.6 million of depreciation and amortization expense compared to $183.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The net decrease of $13.5 million is due to (i) an $8.1 million decrease due to accelerating the remaining useful life of a facility that was demolished in 2023, (ii) a $6.3 million decrease due to assets that have been fully depreciated and (iii) a $5.9 million decrease from properties disposed of after January 1, 2023. These decreases are partially offset by a $4.9 million increase from properties acquired after January 1, 2023 and a $1.9 million increase from additions to real estate.
Interest Expense
We incur interest expense comprised of costs of borrowings plus the amortization of deferred financing costs related to our indebtedness. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $115.3 million of interest expense compared to $113.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The $2.3 million net increase is primarily related to 
a $4.1 million increase in interest expense related to borrowings under the Credit Agreement, partially offset by a $1.8 million decrease in non-cash interest expense related to our interest rate hedges.
Triple-Net Portfolio Operating Expenses
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $17.1 million of triple-net portfolio operating expenses compared to $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The $0.9 million net decrease is primarily due to a $1.3 million decrease due to 
facilities that have since transitioned to new operators who are now paying the property taxes directly 
and a $0.4 million decrease from properties disposed of after January 1, 2023.  The decreases are partially offset by an $0.8 million increase due to 
adjustments to
 our estimates related to property taxes.
40
Senior Housing - Managed Portfolio Operating Expenses
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $210.0 million of Senior Housing - Managed portfolio operating expenses compared to $177.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The $32.7 million net increase is due to (i) a $19.1 million increase related to seven facilities that were transitioned to Senior Housing - Managed communities after January 1, 2023, (ii) a $6.9 million increase related to four Senior Housing - Managed communities acquired after January 1, 2023, (iii) a $3.1 million increase in employee compensation primarily due to increased labor rates and staffing, (iv) a $2.1 million increase in management fees, dining expenses and housekeeping costs due to increased occupancy, (v) a $1.4 million increase in marketing, administrative and corporate overhead expenses and (vi) a $0.4 million increase in taxes primarily due to changes in estimates. These increases are partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease related to one Senior Housing - Managed community disposed of after January 1, 2023.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses include compensation-related expenses as well as professional services, office costs, other costs associated with asset management, and acquisition costs. During the year ended December 31, 2024, general and administrative expenses were $50.1 million compared to $47.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The $2.6 million net increase is related to a $3.2 million increase in compensation, including a $1.0 million increase in stock-based compensation, for our teammates 
as a result of changes in performance-based payout assumptions on compensation and 
annual salary adjustments, partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in insurance expense.
(Recovery of) Provision for Loan Losses
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized a $0.6 million recovery of and a $0.2 million provision for loan losses, respectively, associated with our loans receivable investments.
Impairment of Real Estate
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized an $18.5 million impairment of real estate primarily related to six facilities that were sold or are expected to be sold. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a $14.3 million impairment of real estate related to three facilities that have sold.
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
No loss on extinguishment of debt was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a $1.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to write-offs of deferred financing costs in connection with amending and restating the fifth amended and restated unsecured credit agreement entered into by the Operating Partnership and Sabra Canadian Holdings, LLC and the other parties thereto on September 9, 2019.
Other Income
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $2.7 million of other income related to insurance proceeds received related to a fire that occurred at one of our 
Senior Housing - Managed communities, including $
1.7 million of bu
siness interruption insurance income and a $0.5
 million gain on insurance proceeds 
related to the damage incurred at the facility, and a $0.5 million gain related to our cross currency interest rate swaps. 
During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized $2.6 million of other income related to (i) a $3.7 million 
gain on insurance proceeds received related to property damage incurred at a vacant facility, (ii) $0.5 million of business interruption insurance income related to one Senior Housing - Managed community that was closed due to a fire and (iii) $0.3 million of income related to the
 sale of licensed beds. 
This income is partially offset by $1.5 million of transition-related expenses related to the transition of 14 Senior Housing - Managed communities to new operators in 2023.
Net Gain (Loss) on Sales of Real Estate
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized an aggregate net gain of $2.1 million related to the disposition of 17 skilled nursing/transitional care facilities and one behavioral health facility. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized an aggregate net loss of $76.6 million related to the disposition of 24 skilled nursing/transitional care facilities, three Senior Housing - Leased communities and one Senior Housing - Managed community.
Loss from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $0.4 million of loss from our unconsolidated joint ventures compared to $2.9 million of loss for the year ended December 31, 2023. The $2.5 million net improvement is primarily related 
41
to a $2.7 million increase in revenues net of operating expenses primarily due to increased occupancy, which includes $0.2 million related to one senior housing community acquired by one of our joint ventures after 
January 1, 2023
.
Income Tax Expense
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $1.0 million of income tax expense compared to $2.0 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2023
. The $1.0 million decrease is due to lower taxable income during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Funds from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations
We believe that net income as defined by GAAP is the most appropriate earnings measure. We also believe that funds from operations (“FFO”), as defined in accordance with the definition used by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”), and adjusted funds from operations (“AFFO”) (and related per share amounts) are important non-GAAP supplemental measures of our operating performance. Because the historical cost accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation (except on land), such accounting presentation implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT that use historical cost accounting for depreciation could be less informative. Thus, Nareit created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization, among other items, from net income, as defined by GAAP. FFO is defined as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from real estate dispositions and our share of gains or losses from real estate dispositions related to our unconsolidated joint ventures, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, net of amounts related to noncontrolling interests, plus our share of depreciation and amortization related to our unconsolidated joint ventures, and real estate impairment charges of both consolidated and unconsolidated entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of the depreciable real estate held by the entity. AFFO is defined as FFO excluding stock-based compensation expense, non-cash rental and related revenues, non-cash interest income, non-cash interest expense, non-cash portion of loss on extinguishment of debt, provision for (recovery of) loan losses and other reserves, non-cash lease termination income and deferred income taxes, as well as other non-cash revenue and expense items (including noncapitalizable acquisition costs, transaction costs related to operator transitions and organizational or other restructuring activities, ineffectiveness gain/loss on derivative instruments, and non-cash revenue and expense amounts related to noncontrolling interests) and our share of non-cash adjustments related to our unconsolidated joint ventures. We believe that the use of FFO and AFFO (and the related per share amounts), combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and makes comparisons of operating results among REITs more meaningful. We consider FFO and AFFO to be useful measures for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance because, by excluding the applicable items listed above, FFO and AFFO can help investors compare our operating performance between periods or as compared to other companies. While FFO and AFFO are relevant and widely used measures of operating performance of REITs, they do not represent cash flows from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. FFO and AFFO also do not consider the costs associated with capital expenditures related to our real estate assets nor do they purport to be indicative of cash available to fund our future cash requirements. Further, our computation of FFO and AFFO may not be comparable to FFO and AFFO reported by other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the current Nareit definition or that interpret the current Nareit definition or define AFFO differently than we do.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $980.0 million in liquidity, consisting of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $60.5 million, available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility of $893.4 million and $26.1 million 
43
related to shares outstanding under forward sale agreements under our ATM Program. The Credit Agreement also contains an accordion feature that can increase the total available borrowings to $2.75 billion (from U.S. $1.4 billion plus CAD $150.0 million), subject to terms and conditions.
We have filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that expires in November 2025, which allows us to offer and sell shares of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, rights, units, and certain of our subsidiaries to offer and sell debt securities, through underwriters, dealers or agents or directly to purchasers, on a continuous or delayed basis, in amounts, at prices and on terms we determine at the time of the offering, subject to market conditions.
On February 23, 2023, we established an at-the-market equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) pursuant to which shares of our common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $500.0 million may be sold from time to time (i) by us through a consortium of banks acting as sales agents or directly to the banks acting as principals or (ii) by a consortium of banks acting as forward sellers on behalf of any forward purchasers pursuant to a forward sale agreement.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we utilized the forward feature of the ATM Program to allow for the sale of up to 7.5 million shares of our common stock at an initial weighted average price of $15.47 per share, net of commissions, and we settled 6.0 million shares at a weighted average net price of $14.90 per share, after commissions and fees, resulting in net proceeds of $89.2 million.
As of December 31, 2024, 1.5 million shares remained outstanding under the forward sale agreements, with an initial weighted average price of $17.33 per share, net of commissions.
No other shares were sold under the ATM Program during the year ended December 31, 2024.
As of December 31, 2024, we had $382.8 million available under the ATM Program. Subject to market conditions, we expect to use proceeds from our ATM Program to finance future investments in properties.
Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of operating expenses, including our planned capital expenditures and funding commitments, interest expense, scheduled debt service payments under our loan agreements, dividend requirements, general and administrative expenses and other requirements described under “Material Cash Requirements” below. Based on our current assessment, we believe that our available cash, operating cash flows and borrowings available to us under our Revolving Credit Facility provide sufficient funds for such requirements for the next twelve months. In addition, we do not believe that the restrictions under our Senior Notes Indentures (as defined below) or Credit Agreement significantly limit our ability to use our available liquidity for these purposes.
Our long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of future investments in properties, including any improvements or renovations of current or newly-acquired properties, as well as scheduled debt maturities. We expect to meet these liquidity needs using the sources above as well as the proceeds from issuances of common stock, preferred stock, debt or other securities, additional borrowings, including mortgage debt or a new or refinanced credit facility, and proceeds from the sale of properties. In addition, we may seek financing from U.S. government agencies, including through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and HUD, in appropriate circumstances in connection with acquisitions.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities was $310.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Operating cash inflows were derived primarily from the rental payments received under our lease agreements, resident fees and services net of the corresponding operating expenses, and interest payments from borrowers under our loan and preferred equity investments. Operating cash outflows consisted primarily of interest payments on borrowings and payment of general and administrative expenses, including corporate overhead. Increases to operating cash flows primarily relate to completed investment activity, and decreases to operating cash flows primarily relate to disposition activity and interest expense from increased borrowing activity and higher interest rates. In addition, the change in operating cash flows was impacted by the timing of collections from our tenants and borrowers and fluctuations in the operating results of our Senior Housing - Managed communities. We expect our annualized cash flows provided by operating activities to fluctuate as a result of such activity.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $109.0 million and included $136.4 million used for the acquisition of four facilities, $54.7 million used for additions to real estate, $21.6 million used to provide funding for loans receivable, $2.8 million used to provide funding for a preferred equity investment and $1.3 million used for the investment in an unconsolidated joint venture, partially offset by $96.0 million of net proceeds from the sales of real estate, $5.9 million in repayments of preferred equity investments, $3.6 million in repayments of loans receivable and $2.4 million in insurance proceeds.
44
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $181.6 million and included $280.2 million of dividends paid to stockholders, $2.0 million of principal repayments on secured debt and $0.1 million of payments of deferred financing costs related to the Credit Agreement, partially offset by $86.1 million of proceeds from shares sold through our ATM Program, net of related costs and payroll costs related to the issuance of common stock pursuant to equity compensation arrangements, and $14.6 million of net proceeds from our Revolving Credit Facility.
Please see the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for details of our operating, investing and financing cash activities.
Material Cash Requirements
Our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.

Further, up to $350.0 million of the Revolving Credit Facility may be used for borrowings in certain foreign currencies. The Credit Agreement also contains an accordion feature that can increase the total available borrowings to $2.75 billion, subject to terms and conditions
The Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of January 4, 2027, and includes two six-month extension options. The Term Loans have a maturity date of January 4, 2028.
The obligations of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries.
See Note 9, “Debt,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning the Credit Agreement, including information regarding covenants contained in the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the Credit Agreement.

45
Capital and Other Expenditures and Funding Commitments. 
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, our aggregate capital expenditures were $54.7 million, $84.9 million and $54.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, our aggregate commitment for future capital and other expenditures related to facilities leased under triple-net operating leases was approximately $16 million, of which $13 million will directly result in incremental rental income, and approximately $6 million will be spent over the next 12 months. We also expect to fund capital expenditures related to our Senior Housing - Managed communities.
In addition, as of December 31, 2024, we have committed to provide up to $1.4 million of future funding related to two loan receivable investments.
Dividends. 
To maintain REIT status, we are required each year to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income after certain adjustments. All distributions will be made by us at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements, debt covenants (which include limits on distributions by us), applicable law, and other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.
We paid dividends of $280.2 million on our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024. On February 3, 2025, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of common stock. The dividend will be paid on February 28, 2025 to common stockholders of record as of February 14, 2025.

 In connection with the Operating Partnership’s assumption of the 2026 Notes, we have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the 2026 Notes. The 2029 Notes and 2031 Notes are issued by the Operating Partnership and guaranteed, fully and unconditionally, by us.
These guarantees are subordinated to all existing and future senior debt and senior guarantees of us, as guarantor, and are unsecured. We conduct all of our business through and derive virtually all of our income from our subsidiaries. Therefore, our ability to make required payments with respect to our indebtedness (including the Senior Notes) and other obligations depends on the financial results and condition of our subsidiaries and our ability to receive funds from our subsidiaries.
In accordance with Regulation S-X, the following aggregate summarized financial information is provided for Sabra and the Operating Partnership. This aggregate summarized financial information has been prepared from the books and records maintained by us and the Operating Partnership. The aggregate summarized financial information does not include the investments in, nor the earnings from, subsidiaries other than the Operating Partnership and therefore is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations or financial position had the Operating Partnership operated as an independent entity. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The aggregate summarized balance sheet information as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and aggregate summarized statement of loss information for the year ended December 31, 2024 is as follows (in thousands):

Concentration of Credit Risk
Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of tenants or obligors related to our investments are engaged in similar business activities, or activities in the same geographic region, or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations, including those to us, to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions. We regularly monitor our portfolio to assess potential concentrations of risks. 
Management believes our current portfolio is reasonably diversified across healthcare related real estate and geographical location and does not contain any other significant concentration of credit risks. Our portfolio of 364 real estate properties held for investment as of December 31, 2024 is diversified by location across the U.S. and Canada. 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, no tenant relationship represented 10% or more of our total revenues.

Skilled Nursing Facility Reimbursement Rates
For the year ended December 31, 2024, 39.2% of our revenues was derived directly or indirectly from skilled nursing/transitional care facilities. Medicare reimburses skilled nursing facilities for Medicare Part A services under the Prospective Payment System (“PPS”), as implemented pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and modified pursuant to subsequent laws, most recently the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. PPS regulations predetermine a payment amount per patient, per day, based on a market basket index calculated for all covered costs.
On October 1, 2019, a case-mix classification system called the skilled nursing facility Patient-Driven Payment Model (“PDPM”) became effective pursuant to a CMS final rule. PDPM focuses on clinically relevant factors, rather than volume-based service, for determining Medicare payment. PDPM adjusts Medicare payments based on each aspect of a resident’s care, most notably for non-therapy ancillaries, which are items and services not related to the provision of therapy such as drugs and medical supplies, thereby more accurately addressing costs associated with medically complex patients. It further adjusts the skilled nursing facility per diem payments to reflect varying costs throughout the stay and incorporates safeguards against potential financial incentives to ensure that beneficiaries receive care consistent with their unique needs and goals.
On July 31, 2023, CMS issued a final rule regarding fiscal year 2024 Medicare rates for skilled nursing facilities providing an estimated net increase of 4.0% compared to fiscal year 2023 comprised of an increase as a result of an update to the payment rates of 6.4% (which is based on (i) a market basket increase of 3.0% plus (ii) a market basket forecast error adjustment of 3.6% and less (iii) a productivity adjustment of 0.2%), partially offset by the second phase of the recalibrated PDPM parity adjustment of 2.3%. These figures do not incorporate any of the estimated value-based purchasing reductions for skilled nursing facilities. The new payment rates became effective on October 1, 2023.
On April 22, 2024, CMS issued a final rule that establishes minimum nurse staffing requirements for long-term care facilities (the “Minimum Staffing Standards”). The Minimum Staffing Standards will require a total nurse staffing standard of 3.48 hours per resident day (“HPRD”), which must include at least 0.55 HPRD of direct registered nurse care and 2.45 HPRD of direct nurse aide care. Facilities may use any combination of nurse staff (registered nurse, licensed practical nurse and licensed vocational nurse, or nurse aide) to account for the additional 0.48 HPRD needed to comply with the total nurse staffing standard. Additionally, the Minimum Staffing Standards will require facilities to meet new facility assessment requirements and have a registered nurse onsite 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to provide skilled nursing care. The Minimum Staffing Standards became effective on June 21, 2024, with a compliance deadline for the new facility assessment requirements of August 8, 2024 and a phase-in period consisting of three phases over three years for non-rural facilities and over five years for rural facilities for the staffing requirements. We believe the Minimum Staffing Standards, as implemented in its current form, will exacerbate the staffing challenges already faced by our tenants. The Minimum Staffing Standards are currently being challenged in federal court, however there can be no assurance that the outcome of such challenges will be favorable to us.
On July 31, 2024, CMS issued a final rule regarding fiscal year 2025 Medicare rates for skilled nursing facilities providing an estimated net increase of 4.2% compared to fiscal year 2024 (comprised of (i) a market basket increase of 3.0% plus (ii) a market basket forecast error adjustment of 1.7% and less (iii) a productivity adjustment of 0.5%). These figures do not incorporate any of the estimated value-based purchasing reductions for skilled nursing facilities. The new payment rates became effective on October 1, 2024. Additionally, the proposed rule expands the civil monetary penalties (“CMP”) that can be imposed for noncompliance to allow for more CMPs per instance and per day.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to various market risks, primarily related to adverse changes in interest rates and the exchange rate for Canadian dollars. We use derivative instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate and foreign currency risk. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. See Note 10, “Derivative and Hedging Instruments,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our derivative instruments. 
Interest rate risk. 
As of December 31, 2024, our indebtedness included $1.8 billion aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding, $534.4 million in Term Loans, $106.6 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and $46.1 million of secured indebtedness to third parties on certain of the properties that our subsidiaries own. As of December 31, 2024, we had $640.9 million of outstanding variable rate indebtedness and $893.4 million available for borrowing under our Revolving Credit Facility.
We expect to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rates for our indebtedness. We also may manage, or hedge, interest rate risks related to our borrowings through interest rate swap and collar agreements. As of December 31, 2024, we had interest rate swaps that fix the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) portion of the interest rate for $430.0 million of SOFR-based borrowings under the U.S. dollar Term Loan at a weighted 
47
average rate of 2.93% and interest rate swaps that fix the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate (“CORRA”) portion of the interest rate for CAD $150.0 million of CORRA-based borrowings under the Canadian dollar Term Loan at 2.59%.
From time to time, we may borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility to finance future investments in properties, including any improvements or renovations of current or newly acquired properties, or for other purposes. Because borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to a ratings-based applicable interest margin plus, Daily Simple CORRA plus the CORRA Adjustment, each as defined in the Credit Agreement, for Canadian dollar borrowings, or at the Operating Partnership’s option for U.S. dollar borrowings, either (a) Daily Simple SOFR, as defined in the Credit Agreement, or (b) a base rate determined as the greater of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%, (ii) the prime rate, (iii) Term SOFR, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus 1.0%, and (iv) 1.00%, the interest rate we will be required to pay on any such borrowings will depend on then applicable rates and may vary. An increase in interest rates could make the financing of any investment by us more costly. Rising interest rates could also limit our ability to refinance our debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness.
Assuming a 100 basis point increase or decrease in the index underlying our variable rate debt, and after giving effect to the impact of interest rate derivative instruments, interest expense would increase or decrease by $1.1 million, for the twelve months following December 31, 2024. 
For a discussion of the interest rate risks related to the current capital and credit markets, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Foreign currency risk.
 We are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates as a result of our investments in Canadian real estate. Our foreign currency exposure is partially mitigated through the use of Canadian dollar denominated debt totaling CAD $189.6 million as of December 31, 2024 and cross currency swap instruments. Based on our operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2024, if the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar were to increase or decrease by 10% compared to the average exchange rate during the three months ended December 31, 2024, our cash flows would have decreased or increased, as applicable, by $0.5 million.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f).

Based on our evaluation using 
48
the criteria described in Internal Control—Integrated Framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this Form 10-K, as stated in their attestation report which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income (loss), of comprehensive income (loss), of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
F-2
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Impairment Assessments of Real Estate Investments
As described in Notes 2, 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s real estate investments net carrying value was $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2024. Management regularly monitors events and changes in circumstances, including investment operating performance and general market conditions, that could indicate that the carrying amounts of its real estate investments may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate investments may not be recoverable, the Company assesses the recoverability by estimating whether the Company will recover the carrying value of its real estate investments through the undiscounted future cash flows and the eventual disposition of the investment. The undiscounted future cash flows used to assess recoverability are based on several assumptions and are probability-weighted based on the Company’s best estimates as of the date of evaluation. These assumptions include, among others, market rent, revenue and expense growth rates, absorption period, stabilized occupancy, holding period, market capitalization rates, and estimated market values based on analysis of letters of intent, purchase and sale agreements and comparable sales and other local and national industry market data. If, based on this analysis, the Company does not believe that it will be able to recover the carrying value of its real estate investments, the Company would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of its real estate investments.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impairment assessments of real estate investments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in (a) identifying events and changes in circumstances that are indicators of impairment related to the performance of the investment and market conditions and (b) developing the undiscounted future cash flows utilized in the recoverability assessment of real estate investments with potential impairment and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to (a) management’s identification of events or changes in circumstances related to the performance of the investment and market conditions and (b) management’s probability weightings and assumptions used in the undiscounted future cash flows related to market rent, revenue and expense growth rates, absorption period, stabilized occupancy, holding period and market capitalization rates (collectively referred to as the “significant assumptions”).
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s impairment assessments of investments in real estate properties, including controls over management’s (a) identification of events and changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amounts of the real estate investments may not be recoverable and (b) recoverability assessment of real estate investments with potential impairment. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management's process for (a) identifying events and changes in circumstances that are indicators of impairment and (b) assessing the recoverability of the real estate investments with potential impairments, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the undiscounted cash flow models and probability weightings used in the recoverability assessment process, (iii) testing the completeness, accuracy, relevance and reliability of the underlying data used in the undiscounted cash flow models, (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment of events and changes in circumstances that are indicators of impairment related to performance of the investment and general market conditions indicating that the carrying amounts of its real estate investments may not be recoverable by considering the consistency with the current and past performance of the real estate investment and the consistency with external market and industry data, and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used in the undiscounted future cash flows of real estate investments with potential impairment by considering the consistency of the significant assumptions with the current and past performance of the real estate investments, the consistency with external market and industry data, and whether these significant assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

(“Sun”) and commenced operations on November 15, 2010 following Sabra’s separation from Sun. Sabra elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) with the filing of its United States (“U.S.”) federal income tax return for the taxable year beginning January 1, 2011. Sabra believes that it has been organized and operated, and it intends to continue to operate, in a manner to qualify as a REIT. Sabra’s primary business consists of acquiring, financing and owning real estate property to be leased to third-party tenants in the healthcare sector. Sabra primarily generates revenues by leasing properties to tenants throughout the U.S. and Canada. Sabra owns substantially all of its assets and properties and conducts its operations through Sabra Health Care Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), of which Sabra is the sole general partner and a wholly owned subsidiary of Sabra is currently the only limited partner, or by subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership. The Company’s investment portfolio is primarily comprised of skilled nursing/transitional care facilities, senior housing communities (“Senior Housing - Leased”), behavioral health facilities and specialty hospitals and other facilities, in each case leased to tenants who are responsible for the operations of these facilities; senior housing communities operated by third-party property managers pursuant to property management agreements (“Senior Housing - Managed”); investments in joint ventures; investments in loans receivable; and preferred equity investments.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Sabra and its wholly owned subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).

GAAP requires the Company to identify entities for which control is achieved through voting rights or other means and to determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities (“VIEs”). A VIE is broadly defined as an entity with one or more of the following characteristics: (a) the total equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support; (b) as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack (i) the ability to make decisions about the entity’s activities through voting or similar rights, (ii) the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity, or (iii) the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity; or (c) the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests, and substantially all of the entity’s activities either involve, or are conducted on behalf of, an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights. If the Company were determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the Company would consolidate investments in the VIE. The Company may change its original assessment of a VIE due to events such as modifications of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity’s equity investments at risk and the disposal of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary.
The Company identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both: (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could be significant to the entity. The Company performs this analysis on an ongoing basis. As of December 31, 2024, the Company determined that it was 
no
t the primary beneficiary of any VIEs.
As it relates to investments in loans, in addition to the Company’s assessment of VIEs and whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of those VIEs, the Company evaluates the loan terms and other pertinent facts to determine whether the loan investment should be accounted for as a loan or as a real estate joint venture. If an investment has the characteristics of a real estate joint venture, including if the Company participates in the majority of the borrower’s expected residual profit, the Company would account for the investment as an investment in a real estate joint venture and not as a loan investment. Expected residual profit is defined as the amount of profit, whether called interest or another name, such as an equity kicker, above a reasonable amount of interest and fees expected to be earned by a lender. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
none
 of the Company’s investments in loans were accounted for as real estate joint ventures.
F-10
As it relates to investments in joint ventures, the Company assesses any partners’ rights and their impact on the presumption of control of the partnership by any single partner. The Company also applies this guidance to managing member interests in limited liability companies. The Company reassesses its determination of which entity controls the joint venture if: there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of any partners or members, the general partner or managing member increases or decreases its ownership interests, or there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding ownership interests. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s determination of which entity controls its investments in joint ventures has not changed as a result of any reassessment.
Use of Estimates 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.

Real Estate Investments and Rental Revenue Recognition
Real Estate Acquisition Valuation
All assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition of real estate accounted for as a business combination are measured at their acquisition date fair values. For acquisitions of real estate accounted for as an asset acquisition, the fair value of consideration transferred by the Company (including transaction costs) is allocated to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis. The acquisition value of land, building and improvements are included in real estate investments on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The acquisition value of above market lease, tenant origination and absorption costs and tenant relationship intangible assets is included in lease intangible assets, net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The acquisition value of below market lease intangible liabilities is included in lease intangible liabilities, net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Acquisition costs associated with real estate acquisitions deemed asset acquisitions are capitalized, and costs associated with real estate acquisitions deemed business combinations are expensed as incurred. Restructuring costs that do not meet the definition of a liability at the acquisition date are expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date.
Estimates of the fair values of the tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities require the Company to make significant assumptions to estimate market lease rates, property operating expenses, carrying costs during lease-up periods, discount rates, market absorption periods, and the number of years the property will be held for investment. The Company makes its best estimate based on the Company’s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease. The use of inappropriate assumptions would result in an incorrect valuation of the Company’s acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities, which would impact the amount of the Company’s net income.
Depreciation and Amortization 
Real estate costs related to the acquisition and improvement of properties are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the expected useful life of the asset and the remaining lease term of any property subject to a ground lease. Tenant improvements are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the expected useful life of the asset and the remaining lease term. Depreciation is discontinued when a property is identified as held for sale. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred and significant replacements and betterments are capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of the real estate asset. The Company considers the period of future benefit of an asset to determine its appropriate useful life. Depreciation of real estate assets and amortization of tenant origination and absorption costs and tenant relationship lease intangibles are included in depreciation and amortization on the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss). Amortization of above and below market lease intangibles is included in rental income on the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss). The Company anticipates the estimated useful lives of its assets by class to be generally as follows: land improvements, 
15
 to 
20
 years; buildings and building improvements, 
five
 to 
40
 years; and furniture and equipment, 
three
 to 
10
 years. Intangibles are generally amortized over the remaining noncancellable lease terms, with tenant relationship intangible amortization periods including extension periods.
Impairment of Real Estate Investments 
The Company regularly monitors events and changes in circumstances, including investment operating performance and general market conditions, that could indicate that the carrying amounts of its real estate investments may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate investments may not be recoverable, the Company assesses the recoverability by estimating whether the Company will recover the carrying value of its real estate investments through the undiscounted future cash flows and the eventual disposition of the investment. In some instances, there may be various potential outcomes for an investment and its potential undiscounted future cash flows. In these instances, the 
F-11
undiscounted future cash flows models used to assess recoverability are based on several assumptions and are probability-weighted based on the Company’s best estimates as of the date of evaluation. These assumptions include, among others, market rent, revenue and expense growth rates, absorption period, stabilized occupancy, holding period, market capitalization rates, and estimated market values based on analysis of letters of intent, purchase and sale agreements, and comparable sales and other local and national industry market data. When discounted cash flow is used to determine fair value, a discount rate assumption is also used. The assumptions are generally based on management’s experience in its local real estate markets, and the effects of current market conditions, which are subject to economic and market uncertainties. If, based on this analysis, the Company does not believe that it will be able to recover the carrying value of its real estate investments, the Company would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of its real estate investments. The Company determines estimated fair value based primarily upon (i) estimated sale prices from signed contracts or letters of intent from third-party offers, (ii) discounted cash flow models of the investment over its remaining hold period, (iii) third-party appraisals and (iv) comparable sales and other local and national industry market data.
Revenue Recognition 
The Company recognizes rental revenue from tenants, including rental abatements, lease incentives and contractual fixed increases attributable to operating leases, on a straight-line basis over the term of the related leases when it is probable that substantially all rents over the life of a lease are collectible. Certain of the Company’s leases provide for contingent rents equal to a percentage of the facility’s revenue in excess of specified base amounts or other thresholds. Such revenue is recognized when actual results reported by the tenant, or estimates of tenant results, exceed the applicable base amount or other threshold.
The Company assesses the collectability of rents on a lease-by-lease basis, and in doing so, considers such things as historical bad debts, tenant creditworthiness, current economic trends, facility operating performance, lease structure, credit enhancements (including guarantees), current developments relevant to a tenant’s business specifically and to its business category generally, and changes in tenants’ payment patterns. The Company’s assessment includes an estimation of a tenant’s ability to fulfill all of its rental obligations over the remaining lease term. In addition, with respect to tenants in bankruptcy, management makes estimates of the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims in assessing the estimated collectability of the related receivable. If at any time the Company cannot determine that it is probable that substantially all rents over the life of a lease are collectible, rental revenue will be recognized only to the extent of payments received, and all receivables associated with the lease will be written off irrespective of amounts expected to be collectible. Any recoveries of these amounts will be recorded in future periods upon receipt of payment. Write-offs of receivables and any recoveries of previously written-off receivables are recorded as adjustments to rental revenue.
Revenue from resident fees and services is recorded monthly as services are provided and includes resident room and care charges, ancillary services charges and other resident charges.

Government Grants
By analogy to International Accounting Standards 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, government assistance provided to the Company in the form of an income grant, which is not related to long-lived assets and is not required to be repaid, is recognized as grant income when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Company will comply with any conditions associated with the grant. Additionally, grants are recognized over the periods in which the Company recognizes the qualifying expenses and/or lost income for which the grants are intended to compensate.
 As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the amount of qualifying expenditures exceeded amounts recognized under The Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act and other programs, and the Company had complied with all grant conditions. Accordingly, during each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $
0.1
 million of 
grants in resident fees and services
, and during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $
3.6
 million of 
grants in loss from unconsolidated joint ventures
 in the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss). 
No
 grants were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Casualty Gains and Losses
Income resulting from insurance recoveries of property damage or business interruption losses is recognized when proceeds are received or contingencies related to the insurance recoveries are resolved.
Assets Held for Sale, Dispositions and Discontinued Operations
The Company generally considers real estate to be “held for sale” when the following criteria are met: (i) management commits to a plan to sell the property, (ii) the property is available for sale immediately, (iii) the property is actively being marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, (iv) the sale of the property within one year is considered probable and (v) significant changes to the plan to sell are not expected. Real estate that is held for sale and its 
F-12
related assets are classified as assets held for sale and are included in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Secured indebtedness and other liabilities related to real estate held for sale are classified as liabilities related to assets held for sale and are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Real estate classified as held for sale is no longer depreciated and is reported at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did 
no
t have any assets held for sale.
For sales of real estate where the Company has collected the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for transferring the real estate, the related assets and liabilities are removed from the balance sheet and the resultant gain or loss is recorded in the period in which the transaction closes. Any post-sale involvement is accounted for as separate performance obligations, and when the separate performance obligations are satisfied, the portion of the sales price allocated to each such obligation is recognized.
Additionally, the Company records the operating results related to real estate that has been disposed of or classified as held for sale as discontinued operations for all periods presented if it represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results.

Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
The Company reports investments in unconsolidated entities over whose operating and financial policies it has the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, the Company’s share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income (loss). The initial carrying value of the investment is based on the amount paid to purchase the joint venture interest. Differences between the Company’s cost basis and the basis reflected at the joint venture level are generally amortized over the lives of the related assets and liabilities, and such amortization is included in the Company’s share of earnings of the joint venture. In addition, distributions received from unconsolidated entities are classified based on the nature of the activity or activities that generated the distribution.
The Company regularly monitors events and changes in circumstances, including investment operating performance, changes in anticipated holding period and general market conditions, that could indicate that the carrying amounts of its equity method investments may be impaired. An equity method investment's value is impaired when the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value and the Company determines the decline in value is other-than-temporary. The fair value is estimated based on discounted cash flows models that include all estimated cash inflows and outflows and any estimated debt premiums or discounts. The discounted cash flows are based on several assumptions, including management fee, absorption period, terminal capitalization rates, revenue and expense per bed, revenue and expense growth percentage, replacement reserve per unit, stabilized occupancy, stabilized operating margin, price per bed and discount rates. The assumptions are generally based on management’s experience in its local real estate markets, and the effects of current market conditions, which are subject to economic and market uncertainties. If the Company believes that there is an other-than-temporary decline in the value of an equity method investment, the Company would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of such equity method investment.
Loans Receivable and Credit Losses
Loans Receivable 
The Company’s loans receivable are reflected at amortized cost on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The amortized cost of a loan receivable is the outstanding unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized discounts, costs and fees directly associated with the origination of the loan. 
Loans acquired in connection with a business combination are recorded at their acquisition date fair value. The Company determines the fair value of loans receivable based on estimates of expected discounted cash flows, collateral, credit risk and other factors. The Company does not establish a valuation allowance at the acquisition date, as the amount of estimated future cash flows reflects its judgment regarding their uncertainty. The Company recognizes the difference between the acquisition date fair value and the total expected cash flows as interest income using the effective interest method over the life of the applicable loan. The Company immediately recognizes in income any unamortized balances if the loan is repaid before its contractual maturity.
Interest income on the Company’s loans receivable is recognized on an accrual basis over the life of the investment using the interest method. Direct loan origination costs are amortized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to interest income. When concerns exist as to the ultimate collection of principal or interest due under a loan, the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, and the Company will not recognize interest income until the cash is received, or the loan returns to accrual status. If the 
F-13
Company determines that the collection of interest according to the contractual terms of the loan or through the receipts of assets in satisfaction of contractual amounts due is probable, the Company will resume the accrual of interest. In instances where borrowers are in default under the terms of their loans, the Company may continue recognizing interest income provided that all amounts owed under the contractual terms of the loan, including accrued and unpaid interest, do not exceed the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell.
On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates the collectability of its interest income receivable and establishes a reserve for amounts not expected to be collected. The Company’s evaluation includes reviewing credit quality indicators such as payment status, changes affecting the operations of the facilities securing the loans, and national and regional economic factors. The reserve is a valuation allowance that reflects management’s estimate of losses inherent in the interest income receivable balance as of the balance sheet date. The reserve is adjusted through provision for loan losses and other reserves on the Company’s consolidated statements of income (loss) and is decreased by charge-offs to specific receivables.
Credit Losses
On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates the collectability of its loan portfolio, including the portion of unfunded loan commitments expected to be funded, and establishes an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is calculated using the related amortization schedules, payment histories and loan-to-value ratios. The following rates are applied to determine the aggregate expected losses, which is recorded as the allowance for credit losses: (i) a default rate, (ii) a liquidation cost rate and (iii) a distressed property reduction rate. If no loan-to-value ratio is available, a loss severity rate is applied in place of the liquidation cost rate and the distressed property reduction rate. The default rate is based on average charge-off and delinquency rates from the Federal Reserve, and the other rates are based on industry research and historical performance of a similar portfolio of financial assets. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance that reflects management’s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The reserve is adjusted through provision for loan losses and other reserves on the Company’s consolidated statements of income (loss) and is decreased by charge-offs to specific loans.
Preferred Equity Investments and Preferred Return
Preferred equity investments are accounted for at unreturned capital contributions, plus accrued and unpaid preferred returns. The Company recognizes preferred return income on a monthly basis based on the outstanding investment including any previously accrued and unpaid return. As a preferred member of the preferred equity joint ventures in which the Company participates, the Company is not entitled to share in the joint venture’s earnings or losses. Rather, the Company is entitled to receive a preferred return, which is deferred if the cash flow of the joint venture is insufficient to currently pay the accrued preferred return. 
The Company regularly monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of its preferred equity investments may not be recoverable or realized. On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates its preferred equity investments for impairment based on a comparison of the fair value of the investment to its carrying value. The fair value is estimated based on discounted cash flows that include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specified holding period. If, based on this analysis, the Company does not believe that it will be able to recover the carrying value of its preferred equity investment, the Company would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of its preferred equity investment.
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers all short-term (with an original maturity of three months or less), highly-liquid investments utilized as part of the Company’s cash-management activities to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents may include cash and short-term investments. Short-term investments are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. 
The Company’s cash and cash equivalents balance exceeded federally insurable limits as of December 31, 2024. To date, the Company has experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in its operating accounts. The Company has a corporate banking relationship with Bank of America, N.A. in which it deposits the majority of its cash.

Restricted Cash 
Restricted cash primarily consists of amounts held by an exchange accommodation titleholder or by secured debt lenders to provide for future real estate tax expenditures, tenant improvements and capital expenditures. Pursuant to the terms of the Company’s leases with certain tenants, the Company has assigned its interests in certain of these restricted cash accounts with secured debt lenders to the tenants, and this amount is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Company’s 
F-14
consolidated balance sheets.
 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, restricted cash totaled $
5.9
 million and $
5.4
 million, respectively, and restricted cash obligations totaled $
5.5
 million and $
1.4
 million, respectively.
Stock-Based Compensation 
Stock-based compensation expense for stock-based awards granted to Sabra’s employees (teammates) and its non-employee directors is recognized in the statements of income (loss) based on the estimated grant date fair value, as adjusted. Compensation expense for awards with graded vesting schedules is generally recognized ratably over the period from the grant date to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the recipient providing additional services. Compensation expense for awards with performance-based vesting conditions is recognized based on the Company’s estimate of the ultimate value of such award after considering the Company’s expectations of future performance. Forfeitures of stock-based awards are recognized as they occur.
Deferred Financing Costs 
Deferred financing costs representing fees paid to third parties are amortized over the terms of the respective financing agreements using the interest method. Deferred financing costs related to secured debt, term loans and senior unsecured notes are recorded as a reduction of the related debt liability, and deferred financing costs related to the revolving credit facility are recorded in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, net. Unamortized deferred financing costs are generally expensed when the associated debt is refinanced or repaid before maturity. Costs incurred in seeking financings that do not close are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not close.
Income Taxes
The Company elected to be treated as a REIT with the filing of its U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year beginning January 1, 2011. The Company believes that it has been organized and operated, and it intends to continue to operate, in a manner to qualify as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of the Company’s annual REIT taxable income to stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction or net capital gains and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that it distributes as dividends to its stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants the Company relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially and adversely affect the Company’s net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, the Company believes that it is organized and operates in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT. 
As a result of certain investments, the Company now records income tax expense or benefit with respect to certain of its entities that are taxed as taxable REIT subsidiaries under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations and not under the REIT provisions.
The Company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method and recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Company’s financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, the Company determines deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Any increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes a change in the Company’s judgment about expected future tax consequences of events, is included in the tax provision when such changes occur. Deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided if the Company believes it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes a change in the Company’s judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset, is included in the tax provision when such changes occur.  
The Company evaluates its tax positions using a two-step approach: step one (recognition) occurs when the Company concludes that a tax position, based solely on its technical merits, is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, and step two (measurement) is only addressed if step one has been satisfied (i.e., the position is more likely than not to be sustained). Under step two, the tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit (determined on a cumulative probability basis) that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company will recognize tax penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits as additional tax expense.

F-15
Foreign Currency
Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries’ functional currencies are the local currencies of their respective foreign jurisdictions. The Company translates the results of operations of its foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using average rates of exchange in effect during the period presented, and it translates balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period presented. The Company records resulting currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders’ equity, on its consolidated balance sheets, and it records foreign currency transaction gains and losses as a component of other (expense) income on its consolidated statements of income (loss).
Derivative Instruments
The Company uses certain types of derivative instruments for the purpose of managing interest rate and currency risk. To qualify for hedge accounting, derivative instruments used for risk management purposes must effectively reduce the risk exposure that they are designed to hedge. In addition, at inception, the Company must make an assessment that the transaction that the Company intends to hedge is probable of occurring, and this assessment must be updated each reporting period.
The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at their fair value. For derivatives designated and qualified as a hedge, the change in fair value of the effective portion of the derivatives is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated in hedging relationships or that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting would be recognized in earnings. In addition, the Company classifies cash flows from qualifying cash flow hedging relationships in the same category as the cash flows from the hedged items. 
The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes designating all derivatives that are part of a hedging relationship to specific transactions, as well as recognizing obligations or assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company also assesses and documents, both at inception of the hedging relationship and on a quarterly basis thereafter, whether the derivatives are highly effective in offsetting the designated risks associated with the respective hedged items. If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be highly effective as a hedge, or that it is probable the underlying transaction will not occur, the Company would discontinue hedge accounting prospectively and record the appropriate adjustment to earnings based on the then-current fair value of the derivative.
Fair Value Measurements
Under GAAP, the Company is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, the Company is required to measure other financial instruments and balances at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired loans receivable and long-lived assets). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 
•
Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities; 
•
Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and 
•
Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 
When available, the Company utilizes quoted market prices from an independent third-party source to determine fair value and classifies such items as Level 1 or Level 2. In instances where the market for a financial instrument is not active, regardless of the availability of a nonbinding quoted market price, observable inputs might not be relevant and could require the Company to make a significant adjustment to derive a fair value measurement. Additionally, in an inactive market, a market price quoted from an independent third party may rely more on models with inputs based on information available only to that independent third party. When the Company determines the market for a financial instrument owned by the Company to be illiquid or when market transactions for similar instruments do not appear orderly, the Company may use several valuation sources (including internal valuations, discounted cash flow analysis and quoted market prices) to establish a fair value. If more than one valuation source is used, the Company will assign weights to the various valuation sources. Additionally, when determining the fair value of liabilities in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available, the Company measures fair value using (i) a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities when traded as assets or (ii) another 
F-16
valuation technique that is consistent with the principles of fair value measurement, such as the income approach or the market approach. 
Changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values. In this regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument. 
The Company considers the following factors to be indicators of an inactive market: (i) there are few recent transactions, (ii) price quotations are not based on current information, (iii) price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers (for example, some brokered markets), (iv) indexes that previously were highly correlated with the fair values of the asset or liability are demonstrably uncorrelated with recent indications of fair value for that asset or liability, (v) there is a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums, yields, or performance indicators (such as delinquency rates or loss severities) for observed transactions or quoted prices when compared with the Company’s estimate of expected cash flows, considering all available market data about credit and other nonperformance risk for the asset or liability, (vi) there is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the bid-ask spread, (vii) there is a significant decline or absence of a market for new issuances (that is, a primary market) for the asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities, and (viii) little information is released publicly (for example, a principal-to-principal market). 
The Company considers the following factors to be indicators of non-orderly transactions: (i) there was not adequate exposure to the market for a period before the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets or liabilities under current market conditions, (ii) there was a usual and customary marketing period, but the seller marketed the asset or liability to a single market participant, (iii) the seller is in or near bankruptcy or receivership (that is, distressed), or the seller was required to sell to meet regulatory or legal requirements (that is, forced), and (iv) the transaction price is an outlier when compared with other recent transactions for the same or similar assets or liabilities.

Per Share Data 
Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common equivalents outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by including the effect of dilutive securities, such as the impact of forward equity sales agreements using the treasury stock method and common shares issuable from certain performance restricted stock units and unvested restricted stock units.
 See Note 15, “Earnings Per Common Share.”
Segment
The Company conducts and manages its business of investing in the healthcare sector as 
one
 reportable segment for internal reporting and internal decision-making purposes. The presentation of financial results as 
one
 reportable segment is consistent with the manner in which the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), Sabra’s Chief Executive Officer, evaluates performance and makes resource allocation and operating decisions for the Company. The CODM evaluates performance and makes resource allocation and operating decisions based on net income (loss). Expenses that are significant are the same as shown on the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss).
Beds, Units and Other Measures 
The number of beds, units and other measures used to describe the Company’s real estate investments included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are presented on an unaudited basis. 
Recently Issued Accounting Standards Updates
Adopted
In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (“ASU 2020-04”). ASU 2020-04 provides temporary optional guidance that provides transition relief for reference rate reform, including optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or a reference rate that is expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. ASU 2020-04 is effective upon issuance, and the provisions generally can be applied prospectively as of January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2024. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company elected to apply the hedge accounting expedients related to probability and the assessments of effectiveness for future LIBOR-indexed cash flows to assume that the index upon which future hedged transactions will be based matches the index on the corresponding derivatives. As of July 1, 2023, the Company had converted all of its LIBOR-indexed debt and derivatives to Secured Overnight Financing 
F-17
Rate (“SOFR”)-based indexes (effective with the respective instrument’s next reset date for certain instruments). For all derivatives in hedge accounting relationships, the Company utilized the effective relief in Topic 848 that allows for the continuation of hedge accounting throughout the transition process. Application of these expedients preserves the presentation of derivatives consistent with past presentation. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope, which refines the scope of Topic 848 and clarifies some of its guidance. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, which defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (“ASU 2023-07”). ASU 2023-07 is intended to improve reportable segment disclosures, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses, as well as disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing performance. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company has included additional disclosures related to ASU 2023-07 in this Form 10-K (see “Segment”) and will include additional disclosures related to ASU 2023-07 in its future quarterly and annual reports.
Issued but Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 is intended to improve income tax disclosures, primarily through enhanced rate reconciliation disclosures, including specified categories, and enhanced income taxes paid disclosures, including disaggregation by federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company expects to include additional disclosures related to ASU 2023-09 beginning with its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40), and in January 2025, the FASB issued ASU 2025-01 to clarify the effective date (together, herein referred to as “ASU 2024-03”). ASU 2024-03 is intended to improve expense disclosures, primarily through disaggregated disclosures of specified information about certain costs and expenses included in relevant expense captions on the statement of income (loss). ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements when adopted.

These investments are not consolidated because the Company does not control, through voting rights or other means, the joint ventures.
During 2022, the Company concluded that the estimated fair value of its investment in its joint venture with affiliates of TPG Real Estate, the real estate platform of TPG (the “Enlivant Joint Venture”) had declined to 
zero
. This decline was deemed to be other-than-temporary, and the Company recorded an impairment charge totaling $
57.8
 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 which is included in loss from unconsolidated joint ventures on the accompanying consolidated statements of income (loss). Effective January 1, 2023, the Company discontinued applying the equity method of accounting to the Enlivant Joint Venture, in which it had a 
49
% equity interest. Effective May 1, 2023, the Company withdrew and resigned its membership in the Enlivant Joint Venture and accordingly, no longer has an equity interest in the Enlivant Joint Venture as of such date.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, for the Enlivant Joint Venture (i) certain amounts in the financial information have been reclassified to conform to Sabra’s presentation, (ii) except for basis adjustments, other-than-temporary impairment and loss from unconsolidated joint venture, the financial information reflects the historical cost basis of the assets which predated the Company’s investment in the joint venture and (iii) the Company’s share of net loss excludes certain equity-like compensation expense and the related income tax impact as such expense is not the responsibility of the Company under the terms of the joint venture agreement. Additionally, TPG caused the Enlivant Joint Venture to fund $
25.0
 million of payments to Enlivant beyond amounts contractually required under the management agreement. These payments were to support the operations of Enlivant and are reflected as operating expenses. Funding for the support payments did not require capital contributions from Sabra but rather were funded with proceeds received by the Enlivant Joint Venture from TPG for the issuance of senior preferred interests or with cash on hand at the Enlivant Joint Venture.

IMPAIRMENT OF REAL ESTATE AND DISPOSITIONS
Impairment of Real Estate
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized real estate impairments of $
18.5
 million, $
14.3
 million and $
94.0
 million, respectively, related to 
six
, 
three
 and 
10
 facilities, respectively. These facilities have either been sold or are non-operational.
To estimate the fair value of the impaired facilities, the Company utilized a market approach which considered binding sale agreements, non-binding offers from unrelated third parties or model-derived valuations with significant unobservable inputs, including comparable sales and other local and national industry market data (Level 3 measurements), as applicable. The Company utilized sales price per square foot values ranging from $
4
 to $
73
 in its fair value calculations for 
two
 non-operational facilities impaired during the year ended December 31, 2024.
The Company continues to evaluate additional assets for sale as part of its initiative to recycle capital and further improve its portfolio quality. This could lead to a shorter hold period and could result in the determination that the full amount of the Company’s investment is not recoverable, resulting in an impairment charge or loss on sale which could be material.
F-21

Related to these facilities, the Company recognized net loss of $
2.9
 million, $
84.1
 million and $
89.1
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which includes (i) impairment of $
9.6
 million, $
14.3
 million and $
94.0
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and (ii) net gain (loss) on sale.
The sale of the disposition facilities does not represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results, and therefore the results of operations attributable to these facilities have remained in continuing operations.
6.
OPERATING LEASES
Lessor Accounting
As of December 31, 2024, the substantial majority of the Company’s real estate properties (excluding 
69
 Senior Housing - Managed communities) were leased under triple-net operating leases with expirations ranging from less than 
one year
 to 
19
 years. As of December 31, 2024, the leases had a weighted-average remaining term of 
seven years
. The leases generally include provisions to extend the lease terms and other negotiated terms and conditions. The Company, through its subsidiaries, retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the real estate assets leased to the tenants. The Company may receive additional security under these operating leases in the form of letters of credit and security deposits from the lessee or guarantees from the parent of the lessee. Security deposits received in cash related to tenant leases are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and totaled $
9.0
 million and $
16.4
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and letters of credit deposited with the Company totaled approximately $
64
 million and $
56
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, the Company’s tenants have deposited with the Company $
10.8
 million and $
12.4
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for future real estate taxes, insurance expenditures and tenant improvements related to the Company’s properties and their operations, and these amounts are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
Lessor costs that are paid by the lessor and reimbursed by the lessee are included in the measurement of variable lease revenue and the associated expense. As a result, the Company recognized variable lease revenue and the associated expense of $
14.5
 million, $
15.3
 million and $
17.7
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its tenants by evaluating the ability of the tenants to meet their lease obligations to the Company based on the tenants’ financial performance, including, as applicable and appropriate, the evaluation of any parent guarantees (or the guarantees of other related parties) of such lease obligations. The primary basis for the Company’s evaluation of the credit quality of its tenants (and more specifically the tenant’s ability to pay their rent obligations to the Company) is the tenant’s lease coverage ratio as supplemented by the parent’s fixed charge coverage ratio for those entities with a parent guarantee. These coverage ratios include earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (“EBITDAR”) to rent and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and management fees (“EBITDARM”) to rent at the lease level and consolidated EBITDAR to total fixed charges at the parent guarantor level when such a guarantee exists. The Company obtains various financial and operational information from the majority of its tenants each month and reviews this information in conjunction with the above-described coverage metrics to identify financial and operational trends, evaluate the impact of the industry’s operational and financial environment (including the impact of government reimbursement), and evaluate the management of the tenant’s operations. These metrics help the Company identify potential areas of concern relative to its tenants’ credit quality and ultimately the tenant’s ability to generate sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations, including its obligation to continue to pay the rent due to the Company.
In 2022, the Company concluded that its leases with North American Health Care, Inc. should no longer be accounted for on an accrual basis and wrote off $
15.6
 million of straight-line rent receivable balances related to these leases. The facilities were transitioned to the Ensign Group or Avamere Family of Companies, as applicable, effective February 1, 2023.
F-22
For the year ended December 31, 2024, no tenant relationship represented 10% or more of the Company’s total revenues.
As of December 31, 2024, the future minimum rental payments from the Company’s properties held for investment under non-cancelable operating leases were as follows and may materially differ from actual future rental payments received (in thousands):

Lessee Accounting
For operating leases greater than 12 months for which the Company is the lessee, such as corporate office leases and ground leases, the Company recognizes a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and related lease liability on its consolidated balance sheets at inception of the lease. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use underlying assets for the lease term, and lease liabilities are determined based on the estimated present value of the Company’s minimum lease payments under the agreements. The discount rate used to determine the lease liabilities is based on the estimated incremental borrowing rate on a lease-by-lease basis. Certain of the Company’s lease agreements have options to extend or terminate the contract terms upon meeting certain criteria. The lease term utilized in the calculation of the lease liability includes these options if exercise is considered reasonably certain. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $
7.0
 million and $
11.6
 million of ROU assets included in 
accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, net
, and $
8.3
 million and $
12.5
 million of lease liabilities included in 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities
, respectively, on its consolidated balance sheets.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred lease expense of $
1.3
 million, $
1.4
 million and $
1.2
 million, respectively. 
As of December 31, 2024, the weighted average remaining lease term and discount rate were

DERIVATIVE AND HEDGING INSTRUMENTS
The Company is exposed to various market risks, including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company’s investments and borrowings.  
Certain of the Company’s foreign operations expose the Company to fluctuations of foreign interest rates and exchange rates. These fluctuations may impact the value in the Company’s functional currency, the U.S. dollar, of the Company’s investment in foreign operations, the cash receipts and payments related to these foreign operations and payments of interest and principal under Canadian dollar denominated debt. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to protect the value of its foreign investments and fix a portion of the interest payments for certain debt obligations. The Company does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.
Cash Flow Hedges
The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $
4.3
 million of gains, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months.
Net Investment Hedges
The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on investments it holds in Canada. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates on these foreign investments.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company 
F-31
had 
no
 derivatives in a net liability position related to these agreements. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has not posted any collateral related to these agreements.

FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES
Financial Instruments
The fair value for certain financial instruments is derived using a combination of market quotes, pricing models and other valuation techniques that involve significant management judgment. The price transparency of financial instruments is a key determinant of the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments.
Financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available and whose markets contain orderly transactions will generally have a higher degree of price transparency than financial instruments whose markets are inactive or consist of non-orderly trades. The Company evaluates several factors when determining if a market is inactive or when market transactions are not orderly. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and the Credit Agreement are reasonable estimates of fair value because of the short-term maturities of these instruments. Fair values for other financial instruments are derived as follows:
Loans receivable
: These instruments are presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at their amortized cost and not at fair value. The fair values of the loans receivable were estimated using an internal valuation model that considered the expected cash flows for the loans receivable, as well as the underlying collateral value and other credit enhancements as applicable. The Company utilized discount rates ranging from 
6
% to 
12
% with a weighted average rate of 
6
% in its fair value calculation. As such, the Company classifies these instruments as Level 3.
Preferred equity investments
: These instruments are presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at their cost and not at fair value. The fair values of the preferred equity investments were estimated using an internal valuation model that considered the expected future cash flows for the preferred equity investments, the underlying collateral value and other credit enhancements. The Company utilized discount rates ranging from 
10
% to 
15
% with a weighted average rate of 
11
% in its fair value calculation. As such, the Company classifies these instruments as Level 3.
Derivative instruments
: The Company’s derivative instruments are presented at fair value on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company estimates the fair value of derivative instruments, including its interest rate swaps, interest rate collars and cross currency swaps, using the assistance of a third party using inputs that are observable in the market, which include forward yield curves and other relevant information. Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivative financial instruments fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivative financial instruments utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. The Company has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivative financial instruments. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative financial instruments valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Senior Notes
: These instruments are presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at their outstanding principal balance, net of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums/discounts and not at fair value. The fair values of the Senior Notes were determined using third-party market quotes derived from orderly trades. As such, the Company classifies these instruments as Level 2.
Secured indebtedness
: These instruments are presented on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at their outstanding principal balance, net of unamortized deferred financing costs and premiums/discounts and not at fair value. The fair values of the Company’s secured debt were estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management’s estimates of current market interest rates for instruments with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-value ratio, type of collateral and other credit enhancements. The Company utilized a rate of 
7
% in its fair value calculation. As such, the Company classifies these instruments as Level 3.

Disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments is based on pertinent information available to the Company at the applicable dates and requires a significant amount of judgment. Transaction volume for certain of the Company’s financial instruments remains relatively low, which has made the estimation of fair values difficult. Therefore, both the actual results and the Company’s estimate of fair value at a future date could be materially different.

EQUITY
Common Stock
On February 23, 2023, the Company established an at-the-market equity offering program (the “ATM Program”) pursuant to which shares of its common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $
500.0
 million may be sold from time to time (i) by the Company through a consortium of banks acting as sales agents or directly to the banks acting as principals or (ii) by a consortium of banks acting as forward sellers on behalf of any forward purchasers pursuant to a forward 
F-33
sale agreement. The use of a forward sale agreement would allow the Company to lock in a share price on the sale of shares at the time the agreement is effective, but defer receiving the proceeds from the sale of the shares until a later date. The Company may also elect to cash settle or net share settle all or a portion of its obligations under any forward sale agreement. The forward sale agreements have a 
one year
 term during which time the Company may settle the forward sales by delivery of physical shares of common stock to the forward purchasers or, at the Company’s election, in cash or net shares. The forward sale price that the Company expects to receive upon settlement will be the initial forward price established upon the effective date, subject to adjustments for (i) the forward purchasers’ stock borrowing costs and (ii) certain fixed price reductions during the term of the agreement.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company utilized the forward feature of the ATM Program to allow for the sale of up to 
7.5
 million shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial weighted average price of $
15.47
 per share, net of commissions, and the Company settled 
6.0
 million shares at a weighted average net price of $
14.90
 per share, after commissions and fees, resulting in net proceeds of $
89.2
 million.
As of December 31, 2024, 
1.5
 million shares remained outstanding under the forward sale agreements, with an initial weighted average price of $
17.33
 per share, net of commissions.
No
 other shares were sold under the ATM Program during the year ended December 31, 2024.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
382.8
 million available under the ATM Program.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company issued 
0.3
 million, 
0.3
 million and 
0.6
 million shares, respectively, of common stock as a result of restricted stock unit vestings.
Upon any payment of shares to teammates as a result of restricted stock unit vestings, the teammates’ related tax withholding obligation will generally be satisfied by the Company, reducing the number of shares to be delivered by a number of shares necessary to satisfy the related applicable tax withholding obligation. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred $
2.6
 million, $
1.8
 million and $
3.3
 million, respectively, in tax withholding obligations on behalf of its teammates that were satisfied through a reduction in the number of shares delivered to those participants.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
All stock-based awards are subject to the terms of the 2009 Performance Incentive Plan, which was assumed by the Company effective as of November 15, 2010 in connection with the Company’s separation from Sun and was most recently amended and restated in April 2017. The 2009 Performance Incentive Plan provides for the granting of stock-based compensation, including stock options, time-based stock units, funds from operations-based stock units (“FFO Units”), relative total stockholder return-based stock units (“TSR Units”) and performance-based restricted stock units to directors, officers and other teammates in connection with their employment with or services provided to the Company.  
Restricted Stock Units and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units 
Under the 2009 Performance Incentive Plan, restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units generally have a contractual life or vest over a 
three
- to 
five-year
 period. The vesting of certain restricted stock units may accelerate, as defined in the grant, upon retirement, a change in control and other events. When vested (and subject to any applicable deferral or holdback period), each performance-based restricted stock unit is convertible into 
one
 share of common stock, subject to any deferrals in issuance pursuant to the grant. The restricted stock units are valued on the grant date based on the market price of the Company’s common stock on that date. Generally, the Company recognizes the fair value of the awards over the applicable vesting period as compensation expense. In addition, since the shares to be issued may vary based on the performance of the Company, the Company must make assumptions regarding the projected performance criteria and the shares that will ultimately be issued. The amount of FFO Units that will ultimately vest is dependent on the amount by which the Company’s funds from 
F-34
operations as adjusted (“FFO”) differs from a target FFO amount for a period specified in each grant and will range from 
0
% to 
200
% of the FFO Units initially granted. Similarly, the amount of TSR Units that will ultimately vest is dependent on the amount by which the total shareholder return (“TSR”) of the Company’s common stock differs from a predefined peer group for a period specified in each grant and will range from 
0
% to 
200
% of the TSR Units initially granted. Upon any payment of shares as a result of restricted stock unit vestings, the related tax withholding obligation will generally be satisfied by the Company, reducing the number of shares to be delivered by a number of shares necessary to satisfy the related applicable tax withholding obligation. The value of the shares withheld is dependent on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date the relevant transaction occurs.
The following table summarizes additional information concerning restricted stock units at December 31, 2024:

As of December 31, 2024, the weighted average remaining vesting period of restricted stock units was 
2.7
 years. The weighted average fair value per share at the date of grant for restricted stock units for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
17.49
, $
14.73
 and $
12.78
, respectively. The total fair value of units vested during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
13.2
 million, $
9.1
 million and $
5.7
 million, respectively.
The fair value of the TSR Units is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the grant date for the expected performance period. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility for the most recent 
3
-year period ending on the grant date for the Company and the selected peer companies, and is calculated on a daily basis.

INCOME TAXES
The Company elected to be treated as a REIT with the filing of its U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year beginning January 1, 2011. To qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of its taxable ordinary income. In addition, the Company is required to meet certain asset and income tests. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income that it distributes to its stockholders. The Company also elected to treat certain of its consolidated 
F-35
subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, which are subject to federal, state and foreign income taxes.  In addition, as a result of our investments in Canada, the Company is subject to income taxes under the laws of Canada.
