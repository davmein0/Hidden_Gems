Occupancy percentage represents the facilities’ average operating occupancy for the period indicated and is calculated by dividing the actual census from the period presented by the available beds/units for the same period. Occupancy percentage includes only facilities owned by Sabra as of the end of the respective period for the duration that such facilities were classified as stabilized facilities and excludes facilities for which data is not available or meaningful. Occupancy is only included in periods subsequent to our acquisition and is presented for the trailing twelve month period and one quarter in arrears, except for Senior Housing - Managed, which is presented for the period indicated on a trailing three month basis. All facility financial performance information was provided by, or derived solely from information provided by, our tenants and operators without independent verification by us.
You should not rely upon occupancy percentages, either individually or in the aggregate, to determine the performance of a facility. Other factors that may impact the performance of a facility include the sources of payment, terms of reimbursement and the acuity level of the patients (i.e., the condition of patients that determines the level of skilled nursing and rehabilitation therapy services required). 
 See “Business—Portfolio of Healthcare Investments” in Part I, Item 1 for further discussion regarding the ownership of our properties and the types of healthcare facilities that comprise our properties.
