ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 We operate as a self-administered, self-managed REIT that, through our subsidiaries, owns and invests in real estate serving the healthcare industry.
Our primary business consists of acquiring, financing and owning real estate property to be leased to third-party tenants in the healthcare sector. We primarily generate revenues by leasing properties to tenants and owning properties operated by third-party property managers throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada. 
Our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of skilled nursing/transitional care facilities, senior housing communities (“Senior Housing - Leased”), behavioral health facilities, and specialty hospitals and other facilities, in each case leased to third-party operators; senior housing communities operated by third-party property managers pursuant to property management agreements (“Senior Housing - Managed”); investments in joint ventures; loans receivable; and preferred equity investments.
We expect to grow our investment portfolio while diversifying our portfolio by tenant, facility type and geography within the healthcare sector. We plan to achieve these objectives primarily through making investments directly or indirectly in healthcare real estate, including the development of purpose-built healthcare facilities with select developers. We also intend to achieve our objective of diversifying our portfolio by tenant and facility type through select asset sales and other arrangements with our tenants.
 We employ a disciplined approach in our healthcare real estate investment strategy by investing in assets that provide attractive opportunities for dividend growth and appreciation of asset values, while maintaining balance sheet strength and liquidity, thereby creating long-term stockholder value.
We elected to be treated as a REIT with the filing of our U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year beginning January 1, 2011. We believe that we have been organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, in a manner to qualify as a REIT. We operate through an umbrella partnership, commonly referred to as an UPREIT structure, in which substantially all of our properties and assets are held by Sabra Health Care Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), of which we are the sole general partner and a wholly owned subsidiary of ours is currently the only limited partner, or by subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership.
We maintain a website at 
www.sabrahealth.com
. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) are made available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after such information has been filed or furnished with the SEC. 
Our Industry
We operate as a REIT that holds investments in income-producing healthcare facilities located in the U.S. and Canada. We invest primarily in the U.S. nursing home industry, including skilled nursing and transitional care facilities, the U.S. and Canadian senior housing industry, which includes independent living, assisted living, memory care and continuing care retirement communities, select behavioral health and addiction treatment centers, and acute care and other hospitals. The primary growth drivers of the nursing home and senior housing industries – an aging population and longer life expectancies – present attractive investment opportunities for us. According to the 2023 National Population Projections published by the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of Americans age 75 and older is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 10.1% between 2022 and 2035. Further, according to the Congressional Budget Office, life expectancy is expected to increase to 82.2 years in 2054 from 78.7 years in 2024. In addition, the highly-fragmented nature of the skilled nursing and senior housing industries presents additional investment opportunities.
Demand for senior housing is expected to increase as a result of an aging population and an increase in acuity across the post-acute landscape. Cost containment measures adopted by the federal government have encouraged patient treatment in more cost-effective settings, such as skilled nursing facilities. As a result, high acuity patients that previously would have been treated in acute care hospitals, long-term acute care hospitals and inpatient rehabilitation facilities are increasingly being treated in skilled nursing facilities. According to the National Health Expenditure Projections for 2023-2032 published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), nursing home expenditures are projected to grow from approximately $209 billion in 2023 to approximately $337 billion in 2032, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 5.4%. This focus on high acuity 
4
patients in skilled nursing facilities has resulted in the typical senior housing resident requiring more assistance with activities for daily living, such as assistance with bathing, grooming, dressing, eating, and medication management; however, many older senior housing communities were not built to accommodate a resident who has more needs as well as increased mobility and cognitive issues than in the past. We believe that these trends will create an emphasis on operators who can effectively adapt their operating model to accommodate the changing nursing home patient and senior housing resident and will result in increased demand for purpose-built properties that are complementary to this new system of healthcare delivery.
The hospital industry is broadly defined to include addiction treatment centers and acute care, long-term acute care, rehabilitation and behavioral hospitals. Hospital services comprise one of the largest categories of healthcare expenditures. According to the CMS National Health Expenditure Projections for 2023-2032, hospital care expenditures are projected to grow from approximately $1.5 trillion in 2023 to approximately $2.4 trillion in 2032, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 5.3%. According to the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, addiction and mental illness are ongoing public health crises in the U.S. with approximately 54 million people classified as needing substance abuse treatment but more than 76% not receiving such treatment and approximately 15 million people identified with serious mental illness but almost 30% not receiving treatment, including inpatient or outpatient mental health services, prescription medication for a mental health issue or virtual (i.e., telehealth) services. Hospitals offer a wide range of services, both inpatient and outpatient, in a variety of settings. We believe that demand will increase for innovative means of delivering those services and present additional investment opportunities.
While the factors described above indicate projected growth for our industry, increases in interest rates, labor shortages, inflation and volatility in public equity and fixed income markets have led to increased costs and, at times, limited the availability of capital. These factors, together with the impact of COVID-19, have resulted in decreased occupancy and increased operating costs for our tenants and borrowers, which have negatively impacted their operating results.
We compete for real property investments with other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, healthcare operators, lenders and other investors. Some of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. Increased competition makes it more challenging to identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives. Our ability to compete is also impacted by national and local economic trends, availability of investment alternatives, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, existing laws and regulations, new legislation and population trends. 
In addition, revenues from our properties are dependent on the ability of our tenants and Senior Housing - Managed communities to compete with other healthcare operators. These operators compete on a local and regional basis for residents and patients, and the operators’ ability to successfully attract and retain residents and patients depends on key factors such as the number of facilities in the local market, the types of services available, the quality of care, reputation, age and appearance of each facility, and the cost of care in each locality. Private, federal and state payment programs and the effect of other laws and regulations may also have a significant impact on the ability of our tenants and Senior Housing - Managed communities to compete successfully for residents and patients at the properties.
Portfolio of Healthcare Investments
We have a geographically diverse portfolio of healthcare investments across the U.S. and Canada that offer a range of services including skilled nursing/transitional care, assisted and independent living, memory care and select behavioral health and addiction treatment centers and hospitals. As of December 31, 2024, our investment portfolio consisted of 364 real estate properties held for investment, 14 investments in loans receivable, five preferred equity investments and two investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. Of our 364 properties held for investment as of December 31, 2024, we owned fee title to 360 properties and title under ground leases for four properties.  
Our portfolio consisted of the following types of healthcare facilities as of December 31, 2024: 
•
Skilled Nursing/Transitional Care Facilities

Skilled nursing facilities.
 Skilled nursing facilities provide services that include daily nursing, therapeutic rehabilitation, social services, activities, housekeeping, nutrition, medication management and administrative services for individuals requiring certain assistance for activities in daily living. A typical skilled nursing facility includes mostly one and two bed units, each equipped with a private or shared bathroom, therapy space, activity rooms and community dining facilities. 
Transitional care facilities/units.
 Transitional care facilities/units are licensed nursing facilities or distinct units within a licensed nursing facility that provide short term, intensive, high acuity nursing and medical services. These facilities tend to focus on delivering specialized treatment to patients with cardiac, neurological, pulmonary, orthopedic, and renal conditions. Length of service is typically 30 days or less with the majority of 
5
patients returning to prior living arrangements and functional abilities. Generally, transitional care facilities/units provide services to Medicare, managed care and commercial insurance patients.
•
Senior Housing Communities

Independent living communities.
 Independent living communities are age-restricted multi-family properties with central dining facilities that provide services that include security, housekeeping, activities, nutrition and limited laundry services. Our independent living communities are designed specifically for independent seniors who are able to live on their own, but desire the security and conveniences of community living. Independent living communities typically offer several services covered under a regular monthly fee.
Assisted living communities.
 Assisted living communities provide services that include assistance for activities in daily living and permit residents to maintain some of their privacy and independence as they do not require constant supervision and assistance. Services bundled within one regular monthly fee usually include three meals per day in a central dining room, daily housekeeping, laundry, medical reminders and 24-hour availability of assistance with the activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing and bathing. Professional nursing and healthcare services are usually available at the community on call or at regularly scheduled times. Assisted living communities typically are comprised of studios and one- and two-bedroom suites equipped with private bathrooms and efficiency kitchens.
Memory care communities.
 Memory care communities offer specialized options, services and clinical programs for individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. Purpose-built memory care communities offer a more residential environment than offered in a secured unit of a nursing facility. These communities offer dedicated care and specialized programming from specially trained staff for various conditions relating to memory loss in a secured environment that is typically smaller in scale and more residential in nature than traditional assisted living communities. Residents require a higher level of care, a secure environment, customized therapeutic recreation programs and more assistance with activities of daily living than in assisted living communities. Therefore, these communities have staff available 24 hours a day to respond to the unique needs of their residents.
Continuing care retirement communities.
 Continuing care retirement communities, or CCRCs, provide, as a continuum of care, the services described above for independent living communities, assisted living communities, memory care communities and skilled nursing facilities in an integrated campus.
•
Behavioral Health Facilities
Addiction treatment centers.
 Addiction treatment centers provide treatment services for chemical dependence and substance addictions, which may include inpatient care, outpatient care, medical detoxification, therapy and counseling.
Behavioral hospitals.
 Behavioral hospitals provide inpatient and outpatient care for patients with mental health conditions, chemical dependence or substance addictions.
•
Specialty Hospitals and Other Facilities
Acute care hospitals.
 Acute care hospitals provide emergency room, inpatient and outpatient medical care and other related services for surgery, acute medical conditions or injuries (usually for a short-term illness or condition).
Long-term acute care hospitals.
 Long-term acute care hospitals provide care for patients with complex medical conditions that require longer stays and more intensive care, monitoring or emergency back-up than that available in most skilled nursing facilities.
Rehabilitation hospitals.
 Rehabilitation hospitals provide inpatient and outpatient care for patients who have sustained traumatic injuries or illnesses, such as spinal cord injuries, strokes, head injuries, orthopedic problems, work-related disabilities and neurological diseases.
Residential services facilities.
 Residential services facilities provide services in home and community-based settings, which may include assistance with activities of daily living.
Other facilities.
 Other facilities include facilities other than those described above that are not classified as skilled nursing/transitional care, senior housing or behavioral health.

Significant Credit Concentrations
For the year ended December 31, 2024, no tenant relationship represented 10% or more of our total revenues.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Concentration of Credit Risk” in Part II, Item 7 for additional information, including risks and uncertainties, regarding tenant concentration.

Investment Financing Strategy 
We expect that future investments in properties, including any improvements or renovations of current or newly-acquired properties, will depend on and will be financed, in whole or in part, by our existing cash, borrowings available to us under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) and proceeds from issuances of common stock, preferred stock, debt or other securities. In addition, we may seek financing from U.S. government agencies, including through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”), in appropriate circumstances in connection with acquisitions. We also use derivative instruments in the normal course of business to mitigate interest rate and foreign currency risk. 
Competitive Strengths 
We believe the following competitive strengths contribute significantly to our success: 
Diverse Property Portfolio 
Our portfolio of 364 properties held for investment as of December 31, 2024 is broadly diversified by location across the U.S. and Canada. Our properties in any one state or province did not account for more than 16% of our total beds/units as of December 31, 2024. Our geographic diversification will limit the effect of a decline in any one regional market on our overall performance. We have also been able to diversify, through acquisitions and dispositions, the extent to which our revenues are dependent on our tenants’, borrowers’ and equity investees’ revenues from federal, state and local government reimbursement programs.
Long-Term, Triple-Net Lease Structure 
As of December 31, 2024, the substantial majority of our real estate properties held for investment (excluding 69 Senior Housing - Managed communities) were leased under triple-net operating leases with expirations ranging from less than one year to 19 years, pursuant to which the tenants are responsible for all facility maintenance, code compliance, insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties and all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. As of December 31, 2024, the leases had a weighted-average remaining term of seven years. The leases generally include provisions to extend the lease terms and other negotiated terms and conditions. We, through our subsidiaries, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the real estate assets leased to tenants. We may receive additional security under these operating leases in the form of letters of credit and security deposits from the lessee or guarantees from the parent of the lessee. In addition, certain of our tenants have deposited amounts with us for future real estate taxes, insurance expenditures and tenant improvements related to our properties and their operations.
Senior Housing - Managed Structure
As of December 31, 2024, our real estate properties held for investment included 69 Senior Housing - Managed communities operated by 11 third-party property managers pursuant to property management agreements. The Senior Housing - Managed structure gives us direct exposure to the risks and benefits of the operations of the communities. We generally utilize the Senior Housing - Managed structure when properties present growth opportunities that may be achievable through capital investment and/or property managers providing scale, operating efficiencies and/or ancillary services. The third-party property managers manage our communities in exchange for the receipt of a management fee, and as such, we are not directly exposed to the credit risk of the property managers in the same manner or to the same extent as we are to our triple-net tenants. However, we rely on the property managers’ personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our communities efficiently and effectively. We also rely on the property managers to set appropriate resident fees and otherwise operate our communities in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations.
Strong Relationships with Operators 
The members of our management team have developed an extensive network of relationships with qualified local, regional and national operators of skilled nursing/transitional care facilities and senior housing communities across the U.S. and Canada. This extensive network has been built by our management team through more than 100 years of combined operating experience, involvement in industry trade organizations and the development of banking relationships and investor relations within the skilled nursing and senior housing industries. We believe these strong relationships with operators help us to source investment opportunities.
9
Our relationships with operators include pipeline agreements that we have entered into with certain operators that provide for the acquisition of, and interim capital commitments for, various healthcare facilities. These pipeline agreements, together with repeat transactions with other operators, help support our future growth potential by providing additional investment opportunities with lower acquisition costs than would be required for investments with new operators.
Ability to Identify Talented Operators 
As a result of our management team’s operating experience, network of relationships and industry insight, we have been able and expect to continue to be able to identify qualified local, regional and national operators. We seek operators who possess local market knowledge, demonstrate hands-on management, have proven track records, and focus on quality care and clinical outcomes. These operators are often located in secondary markets, which generally have lower costs to build and favorable demographics as demonstrated by the fact that the percentage of the population over the age of 65 is greater in the markets where we have invested than in the U.S. as a whole. We believe our management team’s experience gives us a key competitive advantage in objectively evaluating an operator’s financial position, focus on care and operating efficiency.
Significant Experience in Proactive Asset Management 
The members of our management team have significant experience developing systems to collect and evaluate data relating to the underlying operational and financial success of healthcare companies and healthcare-related real estate assets. We are able to utilize this experience and expertise to provide our tenants, when requested, with assistance in the areas of marketing, development, facility expansion and strategic planning. We also use information technology that allows us to efficiently and effectively collect tenant, financial, asset management and acquisitions information. Leveraging this allows us to be lean in our operations and proactive in sharing information with our tenants where we can be helpful to them. We actively monitor the operating results of our tenants, and, when requested, we offer support to our operators to identify and capitalize on opportunities to improve the operations of our facilities and the overall financial and operating strength of our operators.
Business Strategies 
We pursue business strategies focused on opportunistic acquisitions and property diversification where such acquisitions meet our investing and financing strategy. We also intend to continue to curate our portfolio to optimize diversification and financial performance, and to maintain a mix of assets well-positioned for the future of healthcare delivery.
The key components of our business strategies include: 
Diversify Asset Portfolio 
We expect to grow our investment portfolio while diversifying our portfolio by tenant, facility type and geography within the healthcare sector. We plan to achieve these objectives primarily through making investments directly or indirectly in healthcare real estate, including the development of purpose-built healthcare facilities with select developers. We also intend to achieve our objective of diversifying our portfolio by tenant and facility type through select asset sales and other arrangements with our tenants.
We expect to grow our portfolio primarily through the acquisition of assisted living, independent living and memory care communities in the U.S. and Canada and through the acquisition of skilled nursing/transitional care facilities in the U.S. We have and expect to continue to opportunistically acquire other types of healthcare real estate, originate financing secured directly or indirectly by healthcare facilities and invest in the development of senior housing communities and skilled nursing/transitional care facilities. We also expect to expand our portfolio through the development of purpose-built healthcare facilities through pipeline agreements and other arrangements with select developers. We further expect to work with existing operators to identify strategic development opportunities. These opportunities may involve replacing, renovating or expanding facilities in our portfolio that may have become less competitive and new development opportunities that present attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition to pursuing acquisitions with triple-net leases, we expect to continue to pursue other forms of investment, including investments in Senior Housing - Managed communities, mezzanine and secured debt investments, and joint ventures for senior housing communities and skilled nursing/transitional care facilities. We also expect to continue to enhance the strength of our investment portfolio by selectively disposing of or repositioning underperforming facilities or working with new or existing operators to transfer underperforming but promising properties to new or other existing operators.
With respect to our debt and preferred equity investments, in general, we originate loans and make preferred equity investments when an attractive investment opportunity is presented and (a) the property is in or near the development phase, (b) the development of the property is completed but the operations of the facility are not yet stabilized or (c) the loan investment will provide capital to existing relationships. A key component of our development strategy related to loan originations and preferred equity investments is having the option to purchase the underlying real estate that is owned by our borrowers (and that

directly or indirectly secures our loan investments) or by the entity in which we have an investment. These options become exercisable upon the occurrence of various criteria, such as the passage of time or the achievement of certain operating goals, and the method to determine the purchase price upon exercise of the option is set in advance based on the same valuation methods we use to value our investments in healthcare real estate. This proprietary development pipeline strategy allows us to diversify our revenue streams and build relationships with operators and developers, and provides us with the option to add new properties to our existing real estate portfolio if we determine that those properties enhance our investment portfolio and stockholder value at the time the options are exercisable.
Maintain Balance Sheet Strength and Liquidity 
We seek to maintain a capital structure that provides the resources and flexibility to support the growth of our business. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $980.0 million in liquidity, consisting of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $60.5 million, available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) of $893.4 million and $26.1 million related to shares outstanding under forward sale agreements under our ATM Program (as defined below). The Credit Agreement (as defined below) also contains an accordion feature that can increase the total available borrowings to $2.75 billion (from U.S. $1.4 billion plus CAD $150.0 million), subject to terms and conditions.
We have filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that expires in November 2025, which allows us to offer and sell shares of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, rights, units, and certain of our subsidiaries to offer and sell debt securities, through underwriters, dealers or agents or directly to purchasers, on a continuous or delayed basis, in amounts, at prices and on terms we determine at the time of the offering, subject to market conditions.
We intend to maintain a mix of Revolving Credit Facility debt, term loan debt, secured debt and unsecured term debt, which, together with our anticipated asset sales as well as our anticipated ability to complete future equity financings, we expect will fund the growth of our operations. Further, we may opportunistically seek access to U.S. government agency financing, including through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and HUD, in appropriate circumstances in connection with acquisitions. 
Develop New Investment Relationships 
We seek to cultivate our relationships with tenants and healthcare providers in order to expand the mix of tenants operating our properties and, in doing so, to reduce our dependence on any single tenant or operator. As of December 31, 2024, we had 60 relationships. We expect to continue to develop new investment relationships as part of our overall strategy to acquire new properties and further diversify our overall portfolio of healthcare properties.  
Capital Source to Underserved Operators 
We believe that there is a significant opportunity to be a capital source to healthcare operators through the acquisition of healthcare properties that are consistent with our investment and financing strategy, but that, due to size and other considerations, are not a focus for other healthcare REITs. We utilize our management team’s operating experience, network of relationships and industry insight to identify financially strong and growing operators in need of capital funding for future growth. In appropriate circumstances, we may negotiate with operators to acquire individual healthcare properties from those operators and then lease those properties back to the operators pursuant to long-term triple-net leases or refinance new projects.
Strategic Capital Improvements 
We intend to continue to support our tenants by providing capital to them for a variety of purposes, including for capital expenditures and facility modernization. We expect to structure the majority of these investments as either lease amendments that produce additional rents or as loans that are repaid by our tenants during the applicable lease term.
Pursue Strategic Development Opportunities 
We expect to work with existing operators to identify strategic development opportunities. These opportunities may involve replacing, renovating or expanding facilities in our portfolio that may have become less competitive and new development opportunities that present attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition to pursuing acquisitions with triple-net leases, we expect to continue to pursue other forms of investment, including investments in Senior Housing - Managed communities, mezzanine and secured debt investments, and joint ventures for senior housing and skilled nursing/transitional care facilities.

Human Capital Matters
Experienced Management Team 
Our management team has extensive healthcare and real estate experience. Richard K. Matros, Chief Executive Officer, President and Chair of Sabra, has more than 40 years of experience in the acquisition, development and disposition of healthcare assets, including nine years at Sun Healthcare Group, Inc. Michael Costa, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Executive Vice President of Sabra, is a finance professional with more than 20 years of experience in commercial real estate finance and accounting. Talya Nevo-Hacohen, Chief Investment Officer, Treasurer and Executive Vice President of Sabra, is a real estate finance executive with more than 25 years of experience in real estate finance, acquisition and development, including three years of experience managing and implementing the capital markets strategy of an S&P 500 healthcare REIT. Through years of public company experience, our management team also has extensive experience accessing both debt and equity capital markets to fund growth and maintain a flexible capital structure.
Teammates and Equal Opportunity
As of December 31, 2024, we employed 50 full-time employees (our teammates), including our executive officers, none of whom is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. As of December 31, 2024, women comprised 56% of our workforce and 64% of our management level/leadership roles. As of December 31, 2024, 34% of our teammates self-identified as being members of one or more ethnic minorities. We believe our ethnic diversity is higher than this reported percentage as another 14% of our teammates chose not to self-identify. We believe that an inclusive and diverse workforce is essential to our continued success. We continuously aim to provide a fair, transparent and safe work environment, fostering a culture that promotes engagement and inclusion for all teammates.
We recognize that attracting and retaining talent at all levels is vital to our continued success. We create a competitive advantage as an employer of choice by reinforcing our value of work-life balance, resulting in increased engagement and retention. All teammates receive competitive salaries and attractive benefits. We take a holistic approach and are focused on empowering teammates by providing a positive and supportive work environment. We invest in our teammates’ well-being through high-quality benefits. Furthermore, we offer a hybrid work model supported by a cybersecurity-focused information technology (“IT”) team to enable our flexible and productive working arrangements.
We foster a collaborative culture and workplace that motivate and drive engagement. It is important to us that teammates feel valued and are committed to achieving goals. By focusing on the team’s output and deliverables, we establish a clear direction with purpose-driven motivation while building autonomy and trust through output-focused expectations. We create added value and engagement by providing the support and tools our teammates need to be successful in their roles. We also provide opportunities and team activities that create a sense of belonging and emotional well-being, which we know positively impact retention and engagement. Company-wide internal surveys are used to gauge levels of engagement and satisfaction, and 98% of participants in our most recent survey would recommend Sabra as a great place to work.
To plan for the future, our performance management strategy proactively reviews evolving roles to address the current and future needs of our business as part of our talent pipeline development strategy. We invest in our teammates’ development so that we have the right people with the right skills at the right time. We provide leadership coaching and training opportunities for management-level teammates to achieve professional goals and for ongoing development for future needs. In addition, our teammates’ development efforts are focused and aligned with our business goals. We also connect our teammates with our accomplished board of directors through quarterly board of directors dinner events.
We support volunteerism and organize opportunities for our teammates as a group to volunteer within the community. Various company events, including life event celebrations, dinners and other social outings, are held regularly throughout the year, as well as an annual all-teammate retreat. We believe that all of these activities increase job satisfaction and support collaboration and team bonding.
Government Regulation
Our tenants are subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local healthcare laws and regulations, including anti-kickback, anti-fraud and abuse provisions codified under the Social Security Act. These provisions prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare and Medicaid. Sanctions for violating these anti-kickback, anti-fraud and abuse provisions include criminal penalties, civil sanctions, fines and possible exclusion from government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. If a facility is decertified as a Medicare or Medicaid provider by CMS or a state, the facility will not thereafter be reimbursed for caring for residents that are covered by Medicare and Medicaid, and the facility would be forced to care for such residents without being reimbursed or to transfer such residents.

Most of our tenants’ skilled nursing/transitional care, assisted living and mental health facilities are licensed under applicable state law. Most of our skilled nursing/transitional care facilities and mental health facilities are certified or approved as providers under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Some of our assisted living facilities are certified or approved as providers under various state Medicaid and/or Medicaid waiver programs. Similarly, the operators of our specialty hospitals must meet the applicable conditions of participation established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and comply with state and local laws and regulations in order to receive Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. State and local agencies survey all skilled nursing/transitional care facilities and some assisted living facilities on a regular basis to determine whether such facilities are in compliance with governmental operating and health standards and conditions for participation in government sponsored third-party payor programs. Under certain circumstances, the federal and state agencies have the authority to take adverse actions against a facility or service provider, including the imposition of a monitor, the imposition of monetary penalties and the decertification of a facility or provider from participation in the Medicare and/or Medicaid/Medicaid waiver programs or licensure revocation. Challenging and appealing notices or allegations of noncompliance can require significant legal expenses and management attention.
CMS and various states in which our tenants operate our facilities have established minimum staffing requirements or may establish minimum staffing requirements in the future. Failure to comply with such minimum staffing requirements may result in the imposition of fines or other sanctions. Most states in which our tenants operate have statutes requiring that prior to the addition or construction of new nursing home beds, to the addition of new services or to certain capital expenditures in excess of defined levels, the tenant first must obtain a certificate of need, which certifies that the state has made a determination that a need exists for such new or additional beds, new services or capital expenditures. The certification process is intended to promote quality healthcare at the lowest possible cost and to avoid the unnecessary duplication of services, equipment and centers. This certification process can restrict or prohibit the undertaking of a project or lengthen the period of time required to enlarge or renovate a facility or replace a tenant.
In addition to the above, those of our tenants who provide services that are paid for by Medicare and Medicaid are subject to federal and state budgetary cuts and constraints that limit the reimbursement levels available from these government programs. Changes to reimbursement or methods of payment from Medicare and Medicaid could result in a substantial reduction in our tenants’ revenues. Various healthcare reform measures became law upon the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “Affordable Care Act”) and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”), which amends certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Further, effective January 16, 2024, Medicare and Medicaid nursing facilities are required to comply with new disclosure requirements relating to the facility’s ownership, management, and the owners of real property lessors upon initial enrollment and revalidation with CMS. This new disclosure requirement involves reporting extensive information and may complicate our tenants’ and operators’ efforts to comply with Medicare and Medicaid requirements. Future Presidential and Congressional elections in the U.S. could result in further changes. Amendments to, repeal of or legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act and regulatory changes could impose further limitations on government payments to our tenants. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Skilled Nursing Facility Reimbursement Rates” in Part II, Item 7 for additional information.
As of December 31, 2024, our subsidiaries owned eight healthcare facilities (five senior housing communities and three skilled nursing/transitional care facilities) with mortgage loans that are guaranteed by HUD. Those facilities are subject to the rules and regulations of HUD, including periodic inspections by HUD, although the tenants of those facilities have the primary responsibility for maintaining the facilities in compliance with HUD’s rules and regulations. The regulatory agreements entered into by each owner and each operator of the property restrict, among other things, any sale or other transfer of the property, modification of the lease between the owner and the operator, use of surplus cash from the property except upon certain conditions and renovations of the property, all without prior HUD approval.
In addition, as an owner of real property, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations address various matters, including asbestos, fuel oil management, wastewater discharges, air emissions, medical wastes and hazardous wastes. The costs of complying with these laws and regulations and the penalties for non-compliance can be substantial. For example, although we do not generally operate or actively manage our properties, we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and cleanup of any property from which there has been a release or threatened release of a regulated material as well as other affected properties, regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release. In addition to these costs, which are typically not limited by law or regulation and could exceed the property’s value, we could be liable for certain other costs, including governmental fines and injuries to persons, property or natural resources. See “Risk Factors—Regulatory Risks—Environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with real estate properties owned by us may materially impair the value of those investments.” in Part I, Item 1A.
