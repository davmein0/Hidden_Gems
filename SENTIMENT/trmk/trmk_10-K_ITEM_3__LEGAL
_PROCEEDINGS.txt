ITEM 3.  LEGAL
 PROCEEDINGS

Information required in this section is set forth under the heading “Legal Proceedings” of Note 17 – Commitments and Contingencies in Part II. Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

In accordance FASB ASC Subtopic 450-20, “Loss Contingencies,” Trustmark will establish an accrued liability for litigation matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable.  At the present time, Trustmark believes, based on its evaluation and the advice of legal counsel, that a loss in any currently pending legal proceeding is not probable and reasonably estimable.  All matters will continue to be monitored for further developments that would make such loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable.  In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, Trustmark cannot predict the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters or the timing of their ultimate resolution.  Management currently believes,

29

however, based upon the advice of legal counsel and Management’s evaluation and after taking into account its current insurance coverage, that the legal proceedings currently pending should not have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s consolidated financial condition.

F FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following provides a narrative discussion and analysis of Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.  This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the supplemental financial data included in Part II. Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.  Discussion and analysis of Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are included in the respective sections within Part II. Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Trustmark’s Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Executive Overview

Trustmark has been committed to meeting the banking and financial needs of its customers and communities for over 130 years and remains focused on providing support, advice and solutions to its customers' unique needs. Trustmark completed the following significant non-routine transactions during the second quarter of 2024:

•
On May 31, 2024, TNB closed the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, FBBI, to Marsh & McLennan Agency LLC, consistent with the terms as previously announced on April 23, 2024.  Trustmark recognized a net gain on the sale of $228.3 million ($171.2 million, net of taxes) in income from discontinued operations.  The operations of FBBI prior to the sale are included in income from discontinued operations for the current and prior periods.

•
Trustmark restructured its investment securities portfolio by selling $1.561 billion of available for sale securities with an average yield of 1.36%, which generated a loss of $182.8 million ($137.1 million, net of taxes) and was recorded to noninterest income (loss) in securities gains (losses), net.  Trustmark also purchased $1.378 billion of available for sale securities with an average yield of 4.85%.

•
Trustmark sold a portfolio of 1-4 family mortgage loans that were at least three payments delinquent and/or nonaccrual at the time of selection totaling $56.2 million, which resulted in a loss of $13.4 million ($10.1 million, net of taxes).  The portion of the loss related to credit totaled $8.6 million ($6.5 million, net of taxes) and was recorded as adjustments to charge-offs and the PCL, LHFI.  The noncredit-related portion of the loss totaled $4.8 million ($3.6 million, net of taxes) and was recorded to noninterest income (loss) in other, net.

•
On April 8, 2024, Visa commenced an initial exchange offer expiring on May 3, 2024, for any and all outstanding shares of Visa Class B-1 common stock (Visa B-1 shares).  Holders participating in the exchange offer would receive a combination of Visa Class B-2 common stock (Visa B-2 shares) and Visa Class C common stock (Visa C shares) in exchange for Visa B-1 shares that were validly tendered and accepted for exchange by Visa.  TNB tendered its 38.7 thousand Visa B-1 shares, 

33

which were accepted by Visa.  In exchange for each Visa B-1 share that was validly tendered and accepted for exchange by Visa, TNB received 50.0% of a newly issued Visa B-2 share and newly issued Visa C shares equivalent in value to 50.0% of a Visa B-1 share.  The Visa C shares that were received by TNB were recognized at fair value, which resulted in a gain of $8.1 million ($6.0 million, net of taxes) and was recorded to noninterest income (loss) in other, net during the second quarter of 2024.  During the third quarter of 2024, TNB sold all of the Visa C shares for approximately the same carrying value as of June 30, 2024.  The Visa B-2 shares were recorded at their nominal carrying value.

In addition to these significant non-routine transactions, Trustmark's financial results for 2024 reflected continued growth in LHFI, an increase in noninterest income and disciplined expense management.  Please see the section captioned "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for additional information regarding the significant non-routine transactions.  Trustmark’s capital position remained solid, reflecting the consistent profitability of its diversified financial services businesses.

These accomplishments are the result of focused efforts to enhance Trustmark's long-term performance and competitiveness.  Trustmark continues to implement technology and streamline processes to enhance its ability to grow and serve customers.  Trustmark is well-positioned to compete in changing economic conditions and create long-term value for its shareholders.  The Board of Directors of Trustmark announced a 4.3% increase in its regular quarterly cash dividend to $0.24 per share from $0.23 per share.  The dividend is payable March 15, 2025, to shareholders of record on March 1, 2025.

Financial Highlights

Trustmark reported net income of $56.3 million, or basic and diluted EPS of $0.92, for the fourth quarter of 2024, compared to a net income of $36.1 million, or basic and diluted EPS of $0.59, in the fourth quarter of 2023.  Trustmark’s reported performance during the quarter ended December 31, 2024, produced a return on average tangible equity of 13.68%, a return on average assets of 1.23%, an average equity to average assets ratio of 10.82% and a dividend payout ratio of 25.00%, compared to a  return on average tangible equity of 11.92%, a return on average assets of 0.77%, an average equity to average assets ratio of 8.51% and a dividend payout ratio of 38.98% during the quarter ended December 31, 2023.

The increase in net income when the fourth quarter of 2024 is compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 was principally due to an increase in revenue.  Revenue, which is defined as net interest income plus noninterest income (loss), totaled $196.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2024 compared to $173.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $23.5 million, or 13.5%.  The increase in total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the same time period in 2023 resulted from an increase in net interest income, principally due to declines in total interest expense as well as an increase in interest on securities-taxable partially offset by a decline in other interest income, and an increase in noninterest income (loss), principally due to increases in mortgage banking, net and other, net.

Net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2024 totaled $155.8 million, an increase of $19.1 million, or 14.0%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.  Interest income totaled $239.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of $6.9 million, or 2.9%, when compared to the same time period in 2023, principally due to an increase in interest on securities-taxable primarily due to the restructuring of the available for sale securities portfolio during the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by a decline in other interest income primarily due to declines in both the balance held at the FRBA and the rate paid by the FRBA on reserves.  Interest expense totaled $83.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of $12.2 million, or 12.7%, when compared to the same time period in 2023, reflecting declines in interest on deposits, interest on federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements (repurchase agreements) and other interest expense.  Interest expense on deposits totaled $75.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, a decline of $4.9 million, or 6.1%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to declines in interest expense on all categories of interest checking accounts and money market demand deposit accounts (MMDA) as well as a decline in interest expense on brokered certificates of deposits (CDs), partially offset by an increase in interest expense on personal CDs.  Interest expense on federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements totaled $4.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of $1.3 million, or 24.5%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to a decline in interest expense on federal funds purchased, reflecting a decline in the amount of upstream federal funds purchased and declines by the FRB in the target federal funds rate.  Other interest expense totaled $3.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of $6.0 million, or 60.6%, when compared to the same time period in 2023 primarily due to a decline in interest expense on FHLB advances as a result of a decline in the amount of outstanding short-term FHLB advances with the FHLB of Dallas.

Noninterest income (loss) for the fourth quarter of 2024 totaled $41.0 million, an increase of $4.3 million, or 11.9%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, principally due to increases in mortgage banking, net and other, net.  Mortgage banking, net totaled $7.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.9 million, or 33.9%, when compared to the same time period in 2023, principally due to a decline in the net negative hedge ineffectiveness and an increase in the gain on sales of loans, net.  Other, net totaled $4.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of $1.7 million, or 66.8%, when compared to the same time period in 2023, principally due to an increase in other miscellaneous income.

34

Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2024 totaled $124.4 million, a decrease of $1.8 million, or 1.4%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, principally due to declines in services and fees and other expense.  Services and fees totaled $26.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of $786 thousand, or 2.9%, when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 primarily due to declines in outside services and fees partially offset by increase in data processing expenses related to software and business process outsourcing expenses.  Other expense totaled $15.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of $678 thousand, or 4.3%, when compared to the same time period in 2023, principally due to declines in other miscellaneous expenses.

Trustmark’s PCL, LHFI for the three months ended December 31, 2024 totaled $7.0 million compared to $7.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $625 thousand, or 8.2%.  The PCL, LHFI for the fourth quarter of 2024 primarily reflected an increase in required reserves as a result of net adjustments to the qualitative reserve factors and changes to the macroeconomic forecasts, partially offset by a decline in specific reserves for individually analyzed LHFI.  The PCL, off-balance sheet credit exposures totaled $502 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2024 compared to a negative $888 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $1.4 million.  The PCL, off-balance sheet credit exposures for the fourth quarter of 2024 primarily reflected increases in required reserves as a result of credit migration and implementation of the External Factor - Credit Quality Review qualitative factor as well as an increase in unfunded commitments, partially offset by a decline in required reserves as a result of changes in the total reserve rate.  Please see the section captioned “Provision for Credit Losses,” for additional information regarding the PCL on LHFI and off-balance sheet credit exposures.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, Trustmark reported net income of $223.0 million, or basic and diluted EPS of $3.65 and $3.63, respectively, compared to $165.5 million, or basic and diluted EPS of $2.71 and $2.70, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023 and $71.9 million, or basic and diluted EPS of $1.17, for the year ended December 31, 2022.  Trustmark’s reported performance for the year ended December 31, 2024, produced a return on average tangible equity of 15.20%, a return on average assets of 1.20% and a dividend payout ratio of 25.21%, compared to a return on average tangible equity of 14.04%, a return on average assets of 0.89% and a dividend payout ratio of 33.95% for the year ended December 31, 2023 and a return on average tangible equity of 6.00%, a return on average assets of 0.41% and a dividend payout ratio of 78.63% for the year ended December 31, 2022.  Trustmark’s average equity to average assets ratio was 9.84%, 8.41% and 9.18% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Trustmark completed the sale of FBBI during the second quarter of 2024.  As such, financial results for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, consist of both continuing and discontinued operations.  The discontinued operations include the financial results of FBBI prior to the sale as well as the net gain on the sale.  Trustmark reported net income from continuing operations of $45.2 million, $153.3 million and $60.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Trustmark's reported performance from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 produced a return on average tangible equity of 3.04%, a return on average assets of 0.24% and a dividend payout ratio of 124.32%, compared to a return on average tangible equity of 12.43%, a return on average assets of 0.82% and a dividend payout ratio of 36.65% for the year ended December 31, 2023, and a return on average tangible equity of 4.86%, a return on average assets of 0.35% and a dividend payout ratio of 92.93%, for the year ended December 31, 2022.  The decrease in net income from continuing operations when 2024 is compared to 2023 was principally due to a decline in total revenue partially offset by a decrease in income taxes from continuing operations.  The increase in net income from continuing operations when 2023 is compared to 2022 was principally due to an increase in total revenue and a decline in noninterest expense.

Revenue totaled $561.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $701.3 million and $646.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of $140.3 million, or 20.0%, and an increase of $55.2 million, or 8.5%, respectively.  The decrease in total revenue for 2024 compared to 2023 was principally due to decline in noninterest income (loss), primarily as a result of the loss on the sale of available for sale securities partially offset by increases in other, net and wealth management, and an increase in net interest income, primarily resulting from increases in interest and fees from LHFS and LHFI and interest on securities as well as a decline in other interest expense, partially offset by an increase in interest expense on deposits and a decrease in other interest income.

Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $584.4 million, an increase of $31.5 million, or 5.7%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.  Interest income totaled $960.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $81.5 million, or 9.3%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, principally due to increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI, primarily as a result of the higher interest rate environment and loan growth, and interest on securities, primarily as a result of restructuring the securities portfolio during the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by a decline in other interest income, primarily due to a decline in the balance held at the FRBA as well as a decline in dividend income from FHLB stock.  Interest expense totaled $375.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $50.0 million, or 15.3%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.  The increase in interest expense when 2024 is compared to 2023 was principally due to an increase in interest on deposits primarily due to rising interest rates, increased competition for deposits and higher average balances, partially offset by a decrease in other interest expense primarily due to a decrease in the amount of short-term FHLB advances held throughout 2024.

35

Noninterest income (loss) for 2024 totaled a negative $23.4 million, a decrease of $171.9 million when compared to 2023, principally due to the $182.8 million loss on the sale of the available for sale securities during the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by increases in other, net and wealth management.  Other, net totaled $17.8 million for 2024, an increase of $7.6 million, or 74.1%, when compared to 2023, principally due to the $8.1 million Visa C shares fair value adjustment during the second quarter of 2024 as well as an increase in cash management service fees and other miscellaneous income, partially offset by the $4.8 million noncredit-related loss on the sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans recorded during the second quarter of 2024.  Wealth management totaled $37.3 million for 2024, an increase of $2.2 million, or 6.2%, when compared to 2023, principally due to increases in brokerage asset management fees and commissions as well as income from annuity services.

Noninterest expense totaled $485.7 million for 2024, a decrease of $10.0 million, or 2.0%, when compared to 2023, principally due to the $6.5 million of litigation settlement expense recorded during 2023 as well as declines in services and fees and salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by an increase in other expense.  Services and fees totaled $101.6 million for 2024, a decrease of $6.2 million, or 5.8%, when compared to 2023, principally due to declines in outside services and fees, telephone expense and advertising expense, partially offset by increases in data processing charges related to software and business process outsourcing fees.  Salaries and employee benefits totaled $266.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 0.8%, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, principally due to decreases in commission expense due to the decline in mortgage originations, severance expense and medical insurance expense, partially offset by increases in salaries expense, primarily due to general merit increases, accrued management performance incentives and stock compensation expense related to performance awards.  Other expense totaled $63.8 million for 2024, an increase of $5.0 million, or 8.6%, when compared to 2023, principally due to increases in FDIC assessment expense, primarily due to an increase in the assessment rate, and other real estate write-downs, partially offset by declines in stationary and supplies and other miscellaneous expenses.

The PCL, LHFI for 2024 totaled $45.9 million and included an $8.6 million PCL, LHFI sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans for the credit-related portion of the loss on the sale of the 1-4 family mortgage loans.  The PCL, LHFI, excluding the PCL, LHFI sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans, for 2024 totaled $37.3 million compared to $27.4 million for 2023, an increase of $9.9 million, or 36.3%.  The PCL, LHFI, excluding the PCL, LHFI sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans, for 2024 primarily reflected an increase in required reserves as a result of credit migrations and other net changes in the qualitative reserve factors, loan growth, changes in the macroeconomic forecast and an increase in specific reserves for individually analyzed credits.  The PCL, off-balance sheet credit exposures totaled a negative $4.7 million for 2024 compared to a negative $2.8 million for 2023, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 67.7%.  The release in PCL, off-balance sheet credit exposures for 2024 primarily reflected a decrease in required reserves as a result of changes in the total reserve rate coupled with a decrease in unfunded commitments which was partially offset by an increase in required reserves as a result of implementing the Performance Trend and the External Factor-Credit Quality Review qualitative reserve factors.  Please see the section captioned “Provision for Credit Losses” for additional information regarding the PCL on LHFI and off-balance sheet credit exposures.

LHFI totaled $13.090 billion at December 31, 2024, an increase of $139.4 million, or 1.1%, compared to December 31, 2023.  The increase in LHFI during 2024 was primarily due to net growth in LHFI secured by real estate and other commercial loans and leases partially offset by net declines in commercial and industrial LHFI and state and other political subdivision LHFI.  For additional information regarding changes in LHFI and comparative balances by loan category, see the section captioned “LHFI.”

At December 31, 2024, nonperforming assets totaled $86.0 million, a decrease of $20.8 million, or 19.5%, compared to December 31, 2023 principally due to a decrease in nonaccrual LHFI.  Total nonaccrual LHFI were $80.1 million at December 31, 2024, a decrease of $19.9 million, or 19.9%, relative to December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of the sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans during the second quarter of 2024 as well as the resolution of three large nonaccrual commercial credits in the Texas and Alabama market regions, partially offset by mortgage loans placed on nonaccrual in the Mississippi market region and three large commercial credits placed on nonaccrual in the Alabama and Texas market regions.  Trustmark's mortgage loans are primarily included in the Mississippi market region because these loans are centrally analyzed and approved as part of the mortgage line of business, which is located in Jackson, Mississippi.  The percentage of total loans (LHFS and LHFI) that are 30 days or more past due and nonaccrual LHFI decreased in 2024 to 1.62% compared to 1.69% in 2023.

Management has continued its practice of maintaining excess funding capacity to provide Trustmark with adequate liquidity for its ongoing operations.  In this regard, Trustmark benefits from its strong deposit base, its investment portfolio and its access to funding from a variety of external funding sources such as upstream federal funds lines, FHLB advances and brokered deposits.  See the section captioned “Capital Resources and Liquidity” for further discussion of the components of Trustmark’s excess funding capacity.

Total deposits were $15.108 billion at December 31, 2024, a decrease of $461.6 million, or 3.0%, compared to December 31, 2023.  During 2024, noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $124.1 million, or 3.9%, primarily due to a decline in commercial demand deposit accounts.  Interest-bearing deposits decreased $337.5 million, or 2.7%, during 2024, primarily due to intentional declines in public interest checking accounts and brokered deposits as well as a decline in consumer interest checking accounts, partially offset by growth in consumer MMDAs and commercial interest checking accounts and consumer CDs.

36

Federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements totaled $324.0 million at December 31, 2024 compared to $405.7 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $81.7 million, or 20.1%, principally due to a decrease in upstream federal funds purchased. Trustmark had $285.0 million of upstream federal funds purchased at December 31, 2024, compared to $370.0 million at December 31, 2023.  Other borrowings totaled $301.5 million at December 31, 2024, a decrease of $181.7 million, or 37.6%, when compared with $483.2 million at December 31, 2023, principally due to a decline in outstanding short-term FHLB advances obtained from the FHLB of Dallas.

Critical Accounting Policies and Accounting Estimates

Trustmark’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the financial services industry.  Application of these accounting principles requires Management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current information and other factors deemed relevant as of the date of the consolidated financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, actual financial results could differ from those estimates.

Certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.  An accounting estimate is considered critical if the accounting estimate requires Management to make assumptions about matters with a significant level of uncertainty and if the accounting estimate, or changes to the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, have had or are reasonable likely to have a material impact to the consolidated financial statements.

For additional information regarding the accounting policies discussed below, please see Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies set forth in Part II. Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

Allowance for Credit Losses

LHFI

The ACL, LHFI is a valuation account, calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 326, that is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans.  The ACL, LHFI represents Management’s best estimate of current expected credit losses on Trustmark’s existing LHFI portfolio considering available information, from internal and external sources, relevant to assessing exposure to credit loss over the contractual term of the instrument.  The ACL, LHFI is adjusted through the PCL, LHFI and reduced by the charge off of loan amounts, net of recoveries.

The credit loss estimation process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of Trustmark’s LHFI portfolio segments.  These segments are further disaggregated into loan classes, the level at which credit risk is estimated.  When computing allowance levels, credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history, delinquency status and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future.  Trustmark’s overall ACL methodology incorporates various qualitative factors, including economic conditions and concentrations of credit, nature and volume of the portfolio, performance trends and external factors.  The economic conditions and concentrations of credit qualitative factor was created for the loans secured by NFNR properties and the loans secured by other real estate loan class, two of Trustmark’s largest loan classes, to address changes in the economic conditions of metropolitan areas and apply additional pool level reserves based on third-party market data and forecast trends.  The performance trend qualitative reserve factor is utilized to incorporate changes in credit quality and is based on migration analyses that allocate additional ACL to non-pass/delinquent loans within each loan pool.  The nature and volume of the portfolio qualitative factor applies to a sub-pool of the LHFI secured by 1-4 family residential properties and utilizes a weighted average remaining maturity (WARM) methodology that uses industry data for the assumptions to support the qualitative adjustment.  The external factors qualitative factor is Management’s best judgment on the loan or pool level impact of all factors that affect the portfolio that are not accounted for using any other part of the ACL methodology.  During the third quarter of 2024, Trustmark activated the External Factor – Credit Quality Review qualitative factor. This qualitative factor ensures reserve adequacy for collectively evaluated commercial loans that may not have been identified and downgraded timely for various reasons.  This qualitative factor population is all commercial loans risk rated 1-5.  These loans are then applied to the historical average of the Watch/Special Mention rated percentage.  Then the balance of these loans are applied additional reserves based on the same reserve rates utilized in the performance trends qualitative factor for Watch/Special Mention rated loans.

Evaluations of the portfolio and individual credits are inherently subjective, as they require estimates, assumptions and judgments as to the facts and circumstances of particular situations.  Determining the appropriateness of the ACL, LHFI is complex and requires judgment by Management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  While Management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of Trustmark’s ACL, LHFI is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond its controls, including the performance of the portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of regulatory authorities toward classification of assets.  In future periods, evaluations of the overall LHFI portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing,

37

may result in significant changes in the ACL and PCL for LHFI.  Given the nature of many of the factors, forecasts and assumptions in the ACL methodology for LHFI, it is not possible to provide meaningful estimates of the impact of any such potential change.

For a complete description of Trustmark’s ACL methodology for the LHFI portfolio, please see Note 5 – LHFI and ACL, LHFI included in Part II. Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures

Trustmark maintains a separate ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit, which are not unconditionally cancellable.  The ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures is a liability account calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 326 and presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Adjustments to the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures are recorded to PCL, off-balance sheet credit exposures.

Expected credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures are estimated by calculating a commitment usage factor over the contractual period for exposures that are not unconditionally cancellable by Trustmark.  Trustmark calculates a loan pool level unfunded amount for the period.  In addition to the unfunded balances, Trustmark uses a funding rate for loan pools that are considered open-ended.  In order to mitigate volatility and incorporate historical experience in the funding rate, Trustmark uses a twelve-quarter moving average.  For the closed-ended loan pools, Trustmark takes a conservative approach and uses a 100% funding rate.  The expected funding rate is applied to each pool’s unfunded commitment balances to ensure that reserves will be applied to each pool based upon balances expected to be funded based upon historical levels.  In addition to the funding rate being applied to the unfunded commitment balance, a reserve rate is applied that is loan pool specific and is applied to the unfunded amount, which includes both quantitative and a majority of the qualitative aspects of the current period's expected credit loss rate.  During 2024, Management implemented a performance trends qualitative factor for unfunded commitments and an External Factor - Credit Quality Review qualitative factor for unfunded commitments.  For both qualitative factors, the same assumptions are applied in the unfunded commitment calculation that are used in the funded balance calculation with the only difference being the unfunded commitment calculation includes the funding rates for the unfunded commitments.  The reserves for these two qualitative factors are added to the other calculated reserve to get a total reserve for off-balance sheet credit exposures.

Evaluations of the unfunded commitments are inherently subjective, as they require estimates, assumptions and judgments as to the facts and circumstances of particular situations.  Determining the appropriateness of the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures is complex and requires judgment by Management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  While Management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate adequacy of Trustmark’s ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond its control, including the performance of the portfolios, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of regulatory authorities toward classification of assets.  In future periods, evaluations of off-balance sheet credit exposures, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the ACL and PCL on off-balance sheet credit exposures.  Given the nature of many of the factors, forecasts and assumptions in the ACL methodology for off-balance sheet credit exposures, it is not possible to provide meaningful estimates of the impact of any such potential change.

For a complete description of Trustmark’s ACL methodology for off-balance sheet credit exposures, please see the section captioned “Lending Related” in Note 17 – Commitments and Contingencies included in Part II. Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

Mortgage Servicing Rights

Trustmark recognizes as assets the rights to service mortgage loans based on the estimated fair value of the MSR when loans are sold and the associated servicing rights are retained.  Trustmark has elected to account for the MSR at fair value.

The fair value of the MSR is determined using a valuation model administered by a third party that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income.  The model incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income, including estimates of prepayment speeds, discount rate, escrow account earnings and contractual servicing fee income and costs.  Management reviews all significant assumptions at least quarterly.  Mortgage loan prepayment speeds, a key assumption in the model, is the annual rate at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage loan principal.  The discount rate used to determine the present value of estimated future net servicing income, another key assumption in the model, is an estimate of the required rate of return investors in the market would require for an asset with similar risk.  Both assumptions can, and generally will, change as market conditions and interest rates change.

By way of example, an increase in either the prepayment speed or discount rate assumption may result in a decrease in the fair value of the MSR, while a decrease in either assumption may result in an increase in the fair value of the MSR.  In recent years, there have been significant market-driven fluctuations in loan prepayment speeds and discount rates.  These fluctuations can be rapid and may continue

38

to be significant.  Therefore, estimating prepayment speeds and/or discount rates within ranges that market participants would use in determining the fair value of the MSR requires significant management judgment.

At December 31, 2024, the MSR fair value was $139.3 million. The impact on the MSR fair value of either a 10% adverse change in prepayment speeds or a 100 basis point increase in discount rates at December 31, 2024, would be a decline in fair value of approximately $4.9 million and $5.6 million, respectively.  Changes of equal magnitude in the opposite direction would produce similar increases in fair value in the respective amounts.  See the section captioned “MSR” in Note 7 – Mortgage Banking included in Part II. Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for additional information regarding the valuation of the MSR.

Recent Legislative and Regulatory Developments

For information regarding legislation and regulation applicable to Trustmark, see the section captioned “Supervision and Regulation” included in Part I. Item 1. – Business of this report.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In addition to capital ratios defined by GAAP and banking regulators, Trustmark utilizes various tangible common equity measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy.  Tangible common equity, as defined by Trustmark, represents common equity less goodwill and identifiable intangible assets.  Trustmark’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital includes common stock, capital surplus and retained earnings, and is reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets, net of associated net deferred tax liabilities as well as disallowed deferred tax assets and threshold deductions as applicable.

Trustmark believes these measures are important because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions.  Additionally, presentation of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of Trustmark’s capitalization to other organizations.  These ratios differ from capital measures defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes shareholders’ equity associated with preferred securities, the nature and extent of which varies across organizations.  In Management’s experience, many stock analysts use tangible common equity measures in conjunction with more traditional bank capital ratios to compare capital adequacy of banking organizations with significant amounts of goodwill or other intangible assets, typically stemming from the use of the purchase accounting method in accounting for mergers and acquisitions.

These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by GAAP and banking regulators.  Because GAAP does not include these capital ratio measures, Trustmark believes there are no comparable GAAP financial measures to these tangible common equity ratios.  Despite the importance of these measures to Trustmark, there are no standardized definitions for them and, as a result, Trustmark’s calculations may not be comparable with other organizations.  Also, there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors.  As a result, Trustmark encourages readers to consider its audited consolidated financial statements and the notes related thereto in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.

Significant Non-routine Transactions

Trustmark discloses certain non-GAAP financial measures, including net income adjusted for significant non-routine transactions, because Management uses these measures for business planning purposes, including to manage Trustmark’s business against internal projected results of operations and to measure Trustmark’s performance.  Trustmark views net income adjusted for significant non-routine transactions as a measure of its core operating business, which excludes the impact of the items detailed below, as these items are generally not operational in nature.  This non-GAAP measure also provides another basis for comparing period-to-period results as presented in the accompanying selected financial data table and the audited consolidated financial statements by excluding potential differences caused by non-operational and unusual or non-recurring items.  Readers are cautioned that these adjustments are not permitted under GAAP.  Trustmark encourages readers to consider its audited consolidated financial statements and the notes related

40

thereto, included in Part II. Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure.

Sale of 1-4 Family Mortgage Loans

Trustmark sold a portfolio of 1-4 family mortgage loans that were at least three payments delinquent and/or nonaccrual at the time of selection totaling $56.2 million, which resulted in a loss of $13.4 million ($10.1 million, net of taxes).  The portion of the loss related to credit totaled $8.6 million ($6.5 million, net of taxes) and was recorded as adjustments to charge-offs and the PCL, LHFI.  The noncredit-related portion of the loss totaled $4.8 million ($3.6 million, net of taxes) and was recorded to noninterest income (loss) in other, net.

Visa Shares Conversion

On April 8, 2024, Visa commenced an initial exchange offer expiring on May 3, 2024, for any and all outstanding shares of Visa Class B-1 common stock (Visa B-1 shares).  Holders participating in the exchange offer would receive a combination of Visa Class B-2 common stock (Visa B-2 shares) and Visa Class C common stock (Visa C shares) in exchange for Visa B-1 shares that were validly tendered and accepted for exchange by Visa.  TNB tendered its 38.7 thousand Visa B-1 shares, which were accepted by Visa.  In exchange for each Visa B-1 share that was validly tendered and accepted for exchange by Visa, TNB received 50.0% of a newly issued Visa B-2 share and newly issued Visa C shares equivalent in value to 50.0% of a Visa B-1 share.  The Visa C shares that were received by TNB were recognized at fair value, which resulted in a gain of $8.1 million ($6.0 million, net of taxes) and was recorded to noninterest income (loss) in other, net during the second quarter of 2024.  During the third quarter of 2024, TNB sold all of the Visa C shares for approximately the same carrying value as of June 30, 2024.  The Visa B-2 shares were recorded at their nominal carrying value.

Securities Portfolio Restructuring

Trustmark restructured its investment securities portfolio by selling $1.561 billion of available for sale securities with an average yield of 1.36%, which generated a loss of $182.8 million ($137.1 million, net of taxes) and was recorded to noninterest income (loss) in securities gains (losses), net.  Trustmark also purchased $1.378 billion of available for sale securities with an average yield of 4.85%.

Reduction in Force Expense

During the fourth quarter 2023, Trustmark incurred reduction in force expenses of $1.4 million related to various restructuring initiatives.

Litigation Settlement Expense

On October 9, 2023, Trustmark entered into a settlement agreement that resolved all current and potential future claims relating to litigation involving Adams/Madison Timber.  As a result of this settlement, Trustmark recognized a one-time charge of $6.5 million of litigation settlement expense during the third quarter of 2023.

On January 13, 2023, TNB entered into a settlement agreement relating to the litigation involving the Stanford Financial Group.  As a result of this settlement, Trustmark recognized a one-time charge of $100.0 million of litigation settlement expense as well as an additional $750 thousand of legal fees during the fourth quarter of 2022.

Results of Operations

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is the principal component of Trustmark’s income stream and represents the difference, or spread, between interest and fee income generated from earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds.  Fluctuations in interest rates, as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, can materially impact net interest income. The net interest margin is computed by dividing fully taxable equivalent (FTE) net interest income by average interest-earning assets and measures how effectively Trustmark utilizes its interest-earning assets in relationship to the interest cost of funding them.  The accompanying Yield/Rate Analysis Table shows the average balances for all assets and liabilities of Trustmark and the interest income or expense associated with earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  The yields and rates have been computed based upon interest income and expense adjusted to a FTE basis using the federal statutory corporate tax rate in effect for each of the periods shown.  Loans on nonaccrual have been included in the average loan balances, and interest collected prior to these loans having been placed on nonaccrual has been included in interest income.  Loan fees included in interest associated with the average LHFS and LHFI balances are immaterial.

Net interest income-FTE for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $30.6 million, or 5.4%, when compared with the year ended December 31, 2023.  The increase in net interest income-FTE when 2024 is compared to 2023 was principally due to increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI-FTE and interest on securities-taxable as well as a decline in other interest expense, partially offset by an increase in total interest on deposits and a decline in other interest income.  The net interest margin-FTE for 2024 increased 19 basis points to 3.51% when compared to 2023.  The increase in the net interest margin-FTE for 2024 was principally due to increases in the yields on the LHFS and LHFI and securities portfolios reflecting the higher interest rate environment and the restructuring of the securities portfolio during 2024, partially offset by higher costs of interest-bearing liabilities.

Average interest-earning assets for 2024 were $17.010 billion compared to $17.082 billion for 2023, a decrease of $71.9 million, or 0.4%, reflecting declines in average securities and average other earning assets partially offset by growth in average loans (LHFS and LHFI).  Average total securities declined $372.8 million, or 10.5%, when 2024 is compared to 2023, principally due to available for sale securities sold net of available for sale securities purchased as part of the restructuring of the available for sale securities portfolio during the second quarter of 2024 as well as calls, maturities and pay-downs of the loans underlying GSE guaranteed securities.  Average other earning assets decreased $181.3 million, or 24.9%, when 2024 is compared to 2023, primarily due to decreases in reserves held at the FRBA and investments in FHLB stock.  Average loans (LHFS and LHFI) increased $482.3 million, or 3.8%, when 2024 is compared to 2023, primarily attributable to an increase in the average balance of the LHFI portfolio of $458.5 million, or 3.6%.  The increase in the average LHFI portfolio when the balances at December 31, 2024 are compared to December 31, 2023 was principally due to net growth in average LHFI secured by real estate and average other commercial loans and leases partially offset by declines in average state and other political subdivision loans.  See the sections captioned "LHFS" and "LHFI" for additional information regarding changes in the LHFS and LHFI portfolios.

Interest income-FTE totaled $972.9 million for 2024, an increase of $80.6 million, or 9.0%, while the yield on total earning assets increased 50 basis points to 5.72% when compared to 2023.  The increase in interest income-FTE in 2024 primarily reflects increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI-FTE and interest on securities-taxable partially offset by a decline in other interest income.  During 2024, interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI-FTE increased $68.6 million, or 8.7%, when compared to 2023, while the yield on loans (LHFS and LHFI) increased to 6.45% compared to 6.16% reflecting the higher interest rate environment and the increase in the average balance of the LHFI portfolio.  During 2024, interest on securities-taxable increased $19.8 million, or 30.0%, when compared to 2023, while the yield on taxable securities increased to 2.70% compared to 1.86% principally due to the restructuring of the securities portfolio.  During 2024, other interest income decreased $7.5 million, or 20.3%, when compared to 2023, while the yield on other

42

earning assets increased to 5.41% compared to 5.10%, primarily due to declines in the balance held at the FRBA and dividend income from FHLB stock.

Average interest-bearing liabilities for 2024 totaled $13.159 billion compared to $12.983 billion for 2023, an increase of $176.1 million, or 1.4%.  The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was primarily the result of increases in average interest-bearing deposits partially offset by a decline in average other borrowings.  Average interest-bearing deposits for 2024 increased $784.0 million, or 6.9%, when compared to 2023, reflecting growth in average time deposits and average interest-bearing demand deposits partially offset by declines in average savings deposits.  Average other borrowings for 2024 decreased $596.0 million, or 60.6%, when compared to 2023, principally due to the decrease in short-term FHLB advances outstanding during the year.

Interest expense for 2024 totaled $375.9 million, an increase of $50.0 million, or 15.3%, when compared with 2023, while the rate on total interest-bearing liabilities increased to 2.86% compared to 2.51%.  The increase in interest expense for 2024 was principally due to the increase in interest on deposits partially offset by a decline in other interest expense.  Interest on deposits increased $83.4 million, or 33.9%, while the rate on interest-bearing deposits increased to 2.70% compared to 2.16% when 2024 is compared to 2023, primarily due to increases in interest on commercial interest checking accounts and all categories of CDs and MMDAs, primarily due to rising interest rates, increased competition for deposits and higher average balances.  Other interest expense decreased $33.2 million, or 55.7%, while the rate on other borrowings decreased to 4.60% compared to 5.09%, when 2024 is compared to 2023, principally due to a decrease in the amount of short-term FHLB advances obtained from the FHLB of Dallas during the year.

The change in interest due to both volume and yield or rate has been allocated to change due to volume and change due to yield or rate in proportion to the absolute value of the change in each.  Tax-exempt income has been adjusted to a tax equivalent basis using the federal statutory corporate tax rate in effect for each of the three years presented.  The balances of nonaccrual loans and the related income recognized have been included for purposes of these computations.

Provision for Credit Losses

The PCL, LHFI is the amount necessary to maintain the ACL, LHFI at the amount of expected credit losses inherent within the LHFI portfolio.  The amount of PCL and the related ACL for LHFI are based on Trustmark’s ACL methodology.  The PCL, LHFI, excluding the PCL, LHFI sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans, totaled $37.3 million for 2024, compared to a PCL, LHFI of $27.4 million for 2023 and $21.7 million for 2022.  The PCL, LHFI, excluding the PCL, LHFI sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans, for 2024 primarily reflected an increase in required reserves as a result of credit migrations and other net changes in the qualitative reserve factors, loan growth, changes in the macroeconomic forecast and an increase in specific reserves for individually analyzed credits.

FASB ASC Topic 326 requires Trustmark to estimate expected credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures which are not unconditionally cancellable by Trustmark.  Trustmark maintains a separate ACL for off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded commitments and letters of credit.  Adjustments to the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures are recorded to the PCL, off-balance sheet credit exposures.  The PCL, off-balance sheet credit exposures totaled a negative $4.7 million for 2024 compared to a negative $2.8 million for 2023, and $1.2 million for 2022.  The release in PCL on off-balance sheet credit exposures for 2024 primarily reflected a decrease in required reserves as a result of changes in the total reserve rate coupled with a decrease in unfunded commitments which was partially offset by an increase in required reserves as a result of implementing the Performance Trend and the External Factor-Credit Quality Review qualitative reserve factors.

See the section captioned “Allowance for Credit Losses” for information regarding Trustmark’s ACL methodology as well as further analysis of the PCL.

The increase in mortgage banking, net when 2024 is compared to 2023 was principally due to an increase in the gain on sales of loans, net partially offset by an increase in the net negative hedge ineffectiveness.  Mortgage loan production totaled $1.418 billion for 2024, a decrease of $36.4 million, or 2.5%, when compared to 2023.  Loans serviced for others totaled $8.763 billion at December 31, 2024, compared with $8.477 billion at December 31, 2023, and $8.116 billion at December 31, 2022.

Representing a significant component of mortgage banking income is gain on sales of loans, net.  The increase in the gain on sales of loans, net when 2024 is compared to 2023 was primarily the result of higher profit margins in secondary marketing activities partially offset by a decrease in the mortgage valuation adjustment.  Loan sales increased $5.3 million, or 0.5%, during 2024 to total $1.141 billion compared to a decrease of $107.0 million, or 8.6%, during 2023 to total $1.136 billion.

The increase in other, net when 2024 is compared to 2023 was principally due to the $8.1 million Visa C shares fair value adjustment during the second quarter of 2024 as well as an increase in other miscellaneous income, partially offset by the $4.8 million noncredit-related loss on the sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans recorded during the second quarter of 2024.  The increase in other miscellaneous income when 2024 is compared with 2023 was principally due to increases in cash management service charges and other partnership investments.

During 2023, Trustmark reclassified its debit card transaction fees from other expense to services and fees.  Prior periods have been reclassified accordingly.

Changes in the various components of noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 are discussed in further detail below.  Management considers disciplined expense management a key area of focus in the support of improving shareholder value.

Salaries and Employee Benefits

The decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense when 2024 is compared to 2023 was principally due to decreases in commission expense due to the decline in mortgage originations, severance expense and medical insurance expense, partially offset by increases in salaries expense, primarily due to general merit increases, accrued management performance incentives and stock compensation expense related to performance awards.

Services and Fees

The decrease in services and fees when 2024 is compared to 2023 was principally due to declines in outside services and fees, telephone expense and advertising expense, partially offset by increases in data processing charges related to software and business process outsourcing fees.

During 2023, Trustmark reclassified its debit card transaction fees from other expense to services and fees.  Prior periods have been reclassified accordingly.

The increase in other expense when 2024 is compared to 2023 was principally due to increases in FDIC assessment expense, primarily due to an increase in the assessment rate, and other real estate write-downs, partially offset by declines in stationary and supplies and other miscellaneous expenses.

For additional analysis of other real estate and foreclosure expenses, please see the section captioned “Nonperforming Assets.”

General Banking

Net interest income for the General Banking Segment for 2024 increased $31.5 million, or 5.8%, when compared with 2023, primarily resulting from increases in interest and fees from LHFS and LHFI and interest on securities as well as a decline in other interest expense, partially offset by an increase in interest expense on deposits and a decrease in other interest income.  Net interest income for the General Banking Segment for 2023 increased $57.6 million, or 11.8%, when compared with 2022, principally due to increases in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI, other interest income and interest on securities, partially offset by an increase in total interest expense.  The PCL (LHFI and off-balance sheet credit exposures) for the General Banking Segment for 2024 totaled $41.1 million compared to a PCL of $26.7 million during 2023 and a PCL of $22.9 million during 2022.  For more information on these net interest income items, please see the sections captioned “Financial Highlights” and “Results of Operations.”

Noninterest income (loss) for the General Banking Segment decreased $174.2 million during 2024 compared to a decrease of $2.9 million, or 2.5%, during 2023.  The decrease in noninterest income (loss) for the General Banking Segment during 2024 was primarily due to the net loss on the sale of available for sale securities, the noncredit-related loss on the sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans and a decrease in mortgage banking, net, partially offset by the gain on the conversion of Visa Class B-1 shares to Visa Class C shares and increases in cash management service fees and other miscellaneous income.  The decrease in noninterest income (loss) for the General Banking Segment during 2023 was primarily due to the decreases in bank card and other fees and mortgage banking, net, partially offset by increases in service charges on deposit accounts and other, net.  Noninterest income (loss) for the General Banking Segment

48

represented a negative 11.7% of total revenue for 2024, 17.2% for 2023 and 19.2% for 2022.  Noninterest income (loss) for the General Banking Segment includes service charges on deposit accounts; wealth management; bank card and other fees; mortgage banking, net; other, net and securities gains (losses), net.  For more information on these noninterest income (loss) items, please see the analysis included in the section captioned “Noninterest Income (Loss).”

Noninterest expense for the General Banking Segment decreased $10.4 million, or 2.2%, during 2024 compared to a decrease of $67.9 million, or 12.8%, during 2023.  The decrease in noninterest expense for the General Banking Segment for 2024 was principally due to the $6.5 million of litigation settlement expense recorded during 2023 as well as declines in services and fees and salaries and employee benefits, partially offset by an increase in other expense.  The decrease in noninterest expense for the General Banking Segment for 2023 was principally due to decreases in litigation settlement expense, outside services and fees and loan expenses, partially offset by increases in salaries and employee benefits, data processing expenses related to software and FDIC assessment expense.  During 2023, Trustmark recognized litigation settlement expense of $6.5 million as a result of the settlement relating to the litigation involving Adams/Madison timber compared to litigation settlement expense of $100.0 million and legal fees of $750 thousand recognized in 2022 as a result of the settlement relating to the litigation involving the Stanford Financial Group.  For more information on these noninterest expense items, please see the analysis included in the section captioned “Noninterest Expense.”

Wealth Management

During 2024, net income for the Wealth Management Segment decreased $157 thousand, or 2.0%, compared to an increase of $2.3 million, or 40.3%, during 2023.  The decrease in net income for the Wealth Management Segment during 2024 was principally due to increases in the PCL and noninterest expense largely offset by an increase in noninterest income.  The increase in net income for the Wealth Management Segment during 2023 was principally due to an increase in the negative PCL.

Net interest income for the Wealth Management Segment increased $80 thousand, or 1.4%, during 2024 compared to an increase of $558 thousand, or 10.5%, during 2023.  The slight increase in net interest income for the Wealth Management Segment during 2024 was principally due to an increase in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI largely offset by an increase in interest expense on deposits.  The increase in net interest income for the Wealth Management Segment during 2023 was principally due to an increase in interest and fees on loans partially offset by an increase in interest on deposits generated by the Private Banking Group.  The PCL for the Wealth Management Segment for 2024 totaled $154 thousand compared to a negative PCL of $2.1 million during 2023 and a negative PCL of $21 thousand during 2022.

Noninterest income for the Wealth Management Segment, which includes income related to investment management, trust and brokerage services, increased $2.4 million, or 6.8%, during 2024, principally due to increases in brokerage asset management fees and commissions as well as income from annuity services.  Noninterest income for the Wealth Management Segment decreased $136 thousand, or 0.4%, during 2023, principally due to declines in income from brokerage services and other miscellaneous income partially offset by increases in income from trust management and annuity services and indirect income allocated to the Wealth Management Segment.

Noninterest expense increased $405 thousand, or 1.3%, during 2024 compared to a decrease of $534 thousand, or 1.6%, during 2023.  The increase in noninterest expense for the Wealth Management Segment for 2024 was principally due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits, primarily related to broker commissions and annual portfolio manager incentives.  The decrease in noninterest expense for the Wealth Management Segment for 2023 was principally due to a decrease in data processing charges related to software, partially offset by an increase in business process outsourcing expenses.

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Trustmark held assets under management and administration of $9.423 billion and $8.250 billion and brokerage assets of $2.638 billion and $2.592 billion, respectively.

Income Taxes

For the year ended December 31, 2024, Trustmark’s combined effective tax rate from continuing operations was a negative 32.7% compared to 15.3% in 2023 and a negative 3.1% in 2022.  The negative effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 was principally due to the significant non-routine transactions that occurred during the second quarter of 2024.  Excluding the significant non-routine transactions, Trustmark’s combined effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2024 was 16.1%.  The negative effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2022 was principally due to the net loss recorded for 2022 as a result of the $100.8 million of litigation settlement expense.  Excluding the litigation settlement expense, Trustmark's combined effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2022 was 14.6%.  Trustmark’s effective tax rate continues to be less than the statutory rate primarily due to various tax-exempt income items and its utilization of income tax credit programs.  Trustmark invests in partnerships that provide income tax credits on a Federal and/or State basis (
i.e.
, new market tax credits, low income housing tax credits or historical

49

tax credits).  The income tax credits related to these partnerships are utilized as specifically allowed by income tax law and are recorded as a reduction in income tax expense.

Financial Condition

Earning assets serve as the primary revenue streams for Trustmark and are comprised of securities, loans, federal funds sold, securities purchased under reverse repurchase agreements and other earning assets.  Average earning assets totaled $17.010 billion, or 91.7% of total average assets, at December 31, 2024, compared with $17.082 billion, or 91.5% of total average assets, at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $71.9 million, or 0.4%.

Securities

The securities portfolio is utilized by Management to manage interest rate risk, generate interest income, provide liquidity and use as collateral for public and wholesale funding.  Risk and return can be adjusted by altering duration, composition and/or balance of the portfolio.  The weighted-average life of the portfolio at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was 4.8 and 4.5 years, respectively.  The increase in the weighted-average life of the portfolio was principally due to the restructuring of the available for sale securities portfolio during the second quarter of 2024.

When compared with December 31, 2023, total investment securities decreased by $161.2 million, or 5.1%, during 2024.  This decrease resulted primarily from available for sale securities sold net of available for sale securities purchased as part of the restructuring of the available for sale securities portfolio during the second quarter of 2024 as well as calls, maturities and pay-downs of the loans underlying GSE guaranteed securities.  Trustmark sold $1.561 billion of available for sale securities during 2024, generating a loss of $182.8 million, compared to $4.8 million of available for sale securities sold during 2023, generating a net gain of $39 thousand.

During 2022, Trustmark reclassified approximately $766.0 million of securities available for sale to securities held to maturity to mitigate the potential adverse impact of a rising interest rate environment on the fair value of the available for sale securities and the related impact on tangible common equity.  At the date of these transfers, the net unrealized holding loss on the available for sale securities totaled approximately $91.9 million ($68.9 million net of tax).  The resulting net unrealized holding losses are being amortized over the remaining life of the securities as a yield adjustment in a manner consistent with the amortization or accretion of the original purchase premium or discount on the associated security.

At December 31, 2024, the net unamortized, unrealized loss on all transferred securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets totaled $46.6 million compared to $57.6 million at December 31, 2023.

Available for sale securities are carried at their estimated fair value with unrealized gains or losses recognized, net of taxes, in AOCI, a separate component of shareholders’ equity.  At December 31, 2024, available for sale securities totaled $1.693 billion, which represented 55.9% of the securities portfolio, compared to $1.763 billion, or 55.3%, at December 31, 2023.  At December 31, 2024, unrealized losses, net on available for sale securities totaled $27.0 million compared to unrealized losses, net of $196.1 million at December 31, 2023.  At December 31, 2024, available for sale securities consisted of U.S. Treasury securities, direct obligations of government agencies and GSE guaranteed mortgage-related securities.

Held to maturity securities are carried at amortized cost and represent those securities that Trustmark both intends and has the ability to hold to maturity.  At December 31, 2024, held to maturity securities totaled $1.335 billion and represented 44.1% of the total securities portfolio, compared with $1.426 billion, or 44.7%, at December 31, 2023.

Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are included in maturity categories based on their stated maturity date.  Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations.

Management continues to focus on asset quality as one of the strategic goals of the securities portfolio, which is evidenced by the investment of 100.0% of the portfolio in U.S. Treasury securities, GSE-backed obligations and other Aaa-rated securities as determined by Moody’s Investors Services (Moody’s).  None of the securities owned by Trustmark are collateralized by assets which are considered sub-prime.  Furthermore, outside of stock ownership in the FHLB of Dallas and FRBA, Trustmark does not hold any other equity investment in a GSE.

At December 31, 2024, Trustmark did not hold securities of any one issuer with a carrying value exceeding 10% of total shareholders’ equity, other than certain GSEs which are exempt from inclusion.  Management continues to closely monitor the credit quality as well as the ratings of the debt and mortgage-backed securities issued by the GSEs and held in Trustmark’s securities portfolio.

The following tables present Trustmark’s securities portfolio by amortized cost and estimated fair value and by credit rating, as determined by Moody’s, at December 31, 2024 and 2023 ($ in thousands):

LHFI at December 31, 2024 increased $139.4 million, or 1.1%, compared to December 31, 2023.  The increase in LHFI during 2024 was primarily due to net growth in LHFI secured by real estate and other commercial loans and leases partially offset by net declines in commercial and industrial LHFI and state and other political subdivision LHFI.

LHFI secured by real estate (loans secured by real estate and other loans secured by real estate) increased $316.4 million, or 3.4%, during 2024, principally due to net growth in other real estate secured LHFI, LHFI secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties (NFNR

52

LHFI) and other LHFI secured by 1-4 family residential properties, partially offset by net declines in construction, land development and other land LHFI and other construction LHFI.  Other real estate secured LHFI increased $321.3 million, or 24.5%, during 2024, primarily due to other construction loans that moved to LHFI secured by multi-family residential properties in the Alabama, Texas and Mississippi market regions.  Excluding other construction loan reclassifications, other real estate secured LHFI declined by $269.2 million, or 20.5%, during 2024, primarily due to declines in LHFI secured by multi-family residential properties in the Alabama, Mississippi, Texas and Tennessee market regions.  NFNR LHFI increased $43.8 million, or 1.3%, during 2024, principally due to other construction loans that moved to NFNR LHFI in the Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Texas market regions.  Excluding other construction loan reclassifications, the NFNR LHFI portfolio decreased $433.4 million, or 12.4%, during 2024 primarily due to declines in nonowner-occupied loans in the Mississippi, Alabama, Texas and Florida market regions as well as declines in owner-occupied loans in the Florida, Tennessee and Texas market regions, which were partially offset by growth in owner-occupied loans in the Alabama market region.  Other LHFI secured by 1-4 family residential properties, which primarily consists of revolving home equity lines of credit, increased $28.2 million, or 4.5%, during 2024 reflecting growth in the Mississippi, Texas, Florida, Tennessee and Alabama market regions.  LHFI secured by construction, land development and other land decreased $55.6 million, or 8.7%, during 2024 principally due to declines in land development loans in Trustmark's Alabama and Mississippi market regions.  Other construction loans decreased $37.9 million, or 4.4%, during 2024 primarily due to other construction loans moved to other loan categories upon the completion of the related construction project partially offset by new construction loans across all six market regions.  During 2024, $1.081 billion loans were moved from other construction to other loan categories, including $603.6 million to multi-family residential loans, $429.9 million to nonowner-occupied loans and $47.4 million to owner-occupied loans.  Excluding all reclassifications between loan categories, growth in other construction loans across all six market regions totaled $1.020 billion during 2024.

State and other political subdivision LHFI decreased $118.6 million, or 10.9%, during 2024, primarily due to declines in the Mississippi and Texas market regions partially offset by growth in the Florida market region.  Commercial and industrial LHFI decreased $82.2 million, or 4.3%, during 2024, primarily due to declines in the Tennessee and Mississippi market regions partially offset by growth in Trustmark’s Alabama and Georgia market regions.  Other commercial loans and leases increased $33.0 million, or 5.9%, during 2024, principally due to increases in equipment finance leases in the Georgia market region and other commercial loans in the Tennessee market region, partially offset by declines in other commercial loans in the Texas, Mississippi and Alabama market regions. Trustmark's commercial leases are primarily reported in the Georgia market region because these leases are centrally analyzed and approved as part of the Equipment Finance line of business which is located in Atlanta, Georgia.  For additional information regarding the equipment finance leases, please see the sections captioned “Lessor Arrangements” included in Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies and Note 10 – Leases of Part II. Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

Due to the increased risk associated with second liens, loan terms and underwriting guidelines differ from those used for products secured by first liens.  Loan amounts and loan-to-value ratios are limited and are lower for second liens than first liens.  Also, interest rates and maximum amortization periods are adjusted accordingly.  In addition, regardless of lien position, the passing credit score for approval of all home equity lines of credit is higher than that of term loans.  The ACL on LHFI is also reflective of the increased risk related to second liens through application of a greater loss factor to this portion of the portfolio.

In the following tables, LHFI reported by region (along with related nonperforming assets and net charge-offs) are associated with location of origination except for loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties (representing traditional mortgages) credit cards and equipment finance loans and leases. Loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties and credit cards are included in the Mississippi region because they are centrally analyzed and approved as part of a specific line of business located at Trustmark’s headquarters in Jackson, Mississippi. The equipment finance loans and leases are primarily reported in the Georgia market region because they are centrally analyzed and approved as part of the Equipment Finance line of business which is located in Atlanta, Georgia.

Allowance for Credit Losses

LHFI

Trustmark’s ACL methodology for LHFI is based upon guidance within FASB ASC Subtopic 326-20, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses – Measured at Amortized Cost,” as well as regulatory guidance from its primary regulator.  The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans.  Credit quality within the LHFI portfolio is continuously monitored by Management and is reflected within the ACL for loans.  The ACL is an estimate of expected losses inherent within Trustmark’s existing LHFI portfolio.  The ACL on LHFI is adjusted through the PCL, LHFI and reduced by the charge off of loan amounts, net of recoveries.

The loan loss estimation process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of Trustmark’s LHFI portfolio segments.  These segments are further disaggregated into loan classes, the level at which credit risk is estimated.  When computing allowance levels, credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history, delinquency status and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future.  Evaluations of the portfolio and individual credits are inherently subjective, as they require estimates, assumptions and judgments as to the facts and circumstances of particular situations.

During the second quarter of 2024, Trustmark executed a sale on a portfolio of 1-4 family mortgage loans that were at least three payments delinquent and/or nonaccrual at the time of selection. As a result of this sale, a credit mark was established for a sub-pool of the loans in the sale. Due to the lack of historical experience and the use of industry data for this sub-pool, management elected to use the credit mark for reserving purposes on a go forward basis for this sub-pool that meet the same credit criteria of being three payments delinquent and/or nonaccrual. All loans of the sub-pool that meet the above credit criteria will be removed from the 1-4 family residential properties pool and placed into a separate pool with the credit mark reserve applied to the total balance.

The econometric models currently in production reflect segment or pool level sensitivities of probability of default (PD) to changes in macroeconomic variables.  By measuring the relationship between defaults and changes in the economy, the quantitative reserve incorporates reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions that will affect the value of its assets, as required by FASB ASC Topic 326.  Under stable forecasts, these linear regressions will reasonably predict a pool’s PD.  However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the macroeconomic variables used for reasonable and supportable forecasting changed rapidly.  At the macroeconomic levels experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, it was not clear that the models in production would produce reasonably representative results since the models were originally estimated using data beginning in 2004 through 2019.  During this period, a traditional, albeit severe, economic recession occurred.  Thus, econometric models are sensitive to similar future levels of PD.

In order to prevent the econometric models from extrapolating beyond reasonable boundaries of their input variables, Trustmark chose to establish an upper and lower limit process when applying the periodic forecasts.  In this way, Management will not rely upon unobserved and untested relationships in the setting of the quantitative reserve.  This approach applies to all input variables, including: Southern Unemployment, National Unemployment, National Gross Domestic Product (GDP), National Home Price Index (HPI), National Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Price Index and the BBB 7-10 Year US Corporate Bond Index.  The upper and lower limits are based on the distribution of the macroeconomic variable by selecting extreme percentiles at the upper and lower limits of the distribution, the 1st and 99th percentiles, respectively.  These upper and lower limits are then used to calculate the PD for the forecast time period in which the forecasted values are outside of the upper and lower limit range.  Additionally, for periods having a PD or loss given default (LGD) at or near zero as a result of the improving macroeconomic forecasts, Management implemented PD and LGD floors to account for the risk associated with each portfolio.  The PD and LGD floors are based on Trustmark's historical loss experience and applied at a portfolio level.

The external factors qualitative factor is Management’s best judgment on the loan or pool level impact of all factors that affect the portfolio that are not accounted for using any other part of the ACL methodology (i.e., natural disasters, changes in legislation, impacts due to technology and pandemics). During the third quarter of 2024, Trustmark activated the External Factor – Credit Quality Review qualitative factor. This qualitative factor ensures reserve adequacy for collectively evaluated commercial loans that may not have been identified and downgraded timely for various reasons. This qualitative factor population is all commercial loans risk rated 1-5. These loans are then applied to the historical average of the Watch/Special Mention rated percentage. Then the balance of these loans are applied additional reserves based on the same reserve rates utilized in the performance trends qualitative factor for Watch/Special Mention rated loans. Then the Watch/Special Mention population is applied the historical Substandard rated percentage and then subsequently applied the Substandard reserve rate utilized in the performance trends qualitative factor as well. The historical Watch/Special Mention and Substandard rated percentage averages captures the weighted-average life of the commercial loan portfolio. Thus, Trustmark will allocate additional reserves to capture the proportion of potential Watch/Special Mention and Substandard rated credits that may not have been categorized as such at any given point in time through the life of the commercial loan portfolio.

56

During 2022, Management elected to activate the nature and volume of the portfolio qualitative factor as a result of a sub-pool of the secured by 1-4 family residential properties growing to a significant size along with the underlying nature being different as well. The nature and volume of the portfolio qualitative factor utilizes a WARM methodology that uses industry data for the assumptions to support the qualitative adjustment. The industry data is used to compile a PD based on credit score ranges along with using the industry data to compile an LGD. The sub-pools of credits are then aggregated into the appropriate credit score bands in which a weighted-average loss rate is calculated based on the PD and LGD for each credit score range. This weighted-average loss rate is then applied to the expected balance for the sub-segment of credits. This total is then used as the qualitative reserve adjustment.

Trustmark's current quantitative methodologies do not completely incorporate changes in credit quality.  As a result, Trustmark utilizes the performance trends qualitative factor.  This factor is based on migration analyses, that allocates additional ACL to non-pass/delinquent loans within each pool.  In this way, Management believes the ACL will directly reflect changes in risk, based on the performance of the loans with a pool, whether declining or improving.

The performance trends qualitative factor is estimated by properly segmenting loan pools into risk levels by risk rating for commercial credits and delinquency status for consumer credits.  A migration analysis is then performed quarterly using a third-party software and the results for each risk level are compiled to calculate the historical PD average for each loan portfolio based on risk levels.  This average historical PD rate is updated annually.  For the mortgage portfolio, Trustmark uses an internal report to incorporate a roll rate method for the calculation of the PD rate.  In addition to the PD rate for each portfolio, Management incorporates the quantitative rate and the k value derived from the Frye-Jacobs method to calculate a loss estimate that includes both PD and LGD.  The quantitative rate is used to eliminate any additional reserve that the quantitative reserve already includes.  Finally, the loss estimate rate is then applied to the total balances for each risk level for each portfolio to calculate a qualitative reserve

Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by Management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  In future periods, evaluations of the overall LHFI portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense.

For a complete description of Trustmark’s ACL methodology and the quantitative and qualitative factors included in the calculation, please see Note 5 – LHFI and ACL, LHFI included in Part II. Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

At December 31, 2024, the ACL, LHFI was $160.3 million, an increase of $20.9 million, or 15.0%, when compared with December 31, 2023.  The increase in the ACL, LHFI during 2024 was principally due to credit migration and other net changes in the qualitative reserve factors, loan growth, changes in the macroeconomic forecast and an increase in specific reserves for individually analyzed credits.  Allocation of Trustmark’s ACL, LHFI represented 1.10% of commercial LHFI and 1.62% of consumer and home mortgage LHFI, resulting in an ACL to total LHFI of 1.22% at December 31, 2024.  This compares with an ACL to total LHFI of 1.08% at December 31, 2023, which was allocated to commercial LHFI at 0.85% and to consumer and home mortgage LHFI at 1.81%.

Charge-offs exceeded recoveries for 2024 resulting in net charge-offs of $25.0 million, or 0.19% of average loans (LHFS and LHFI), compared to net charge-offs of $8.2 million, or 0.06% of average loans (LHFS and LHFI), in 2023, and net charge-offs of $920 thousand, or 0.01% of average loans (LHFS and LHFI), in 2022.  The increase in net charge-offs during 2024 was principally due to the charge-offs related to the sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans during the second quarter of 2024 and an increase in gross charge-offs in the Alabama and Texas market regions, primarily related to four large nonaccrual commercial credits, as well as a decline in gross recoveries in the Tennessee market region, partially offset by an increase in gross recoveries in the Texas market region.  Excluding the charge-offs related to the sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans, net charge-offs totaled $16.4 million, or 0.12% of average loans (LHFS and LHFI), in 2024.

The PCL, LHFI, excluding the PCL, LHFI 1-4 family mortgage loans, for 2024 totaled 0.28% of average loans (LHFS and LHFI), compared to 0.21% of average loans (LHFS and LHFI) in 2023 and 0.19% of average loans (LHFS and LHFI) in 2022.  The PCL, LHFI, excluding the PCL, LHFI sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans, for 2024 primarily reflected an increase in required reserves as a result of credit migration and other net changes in the qualitative reserve factors, loan growth, changes in the macroeconomic forecast and an increase in specific reserves for individually analyzed credits.

59

Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures

Trustmark maintains a separate ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit, which is included on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Expected credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures are estimated by calculating a commitment usage factor over the contractual period for exposures that are not unconditionally cancellable by Trustmark. Trustmark calculates a loan pool level unfunded amount for the period. Trustmark calculates an expected funding rate each period which is applied to each pool’s unfunded commitment balances to ensure that reserves will be applied to each pool based upon balances expected to be funded based upon historical levels. Additionally, a reserve rate is applied to the unfunded commitment balance, which includes both quantitative and a majority of the qualitative aspects of the current period's expected credit loss rate.  During 2024, Management implemented a performance trends qualitative factor for unfunded commitments and an External Factor - Credit Quality Review qualitative factor for unfunded commitments.  For both qualitative factors, the same assumptions are applied in the unfunded commitment calculation that are used in the funded balance calculation with the only difference being the unfunded commitment calculation includes the funding rates for the unfunded commitments.  The reserves for these two qualitative factors are added to the other calculated reserve to get a total reserve for off-balance sheet credit exposures.  See the section captioned “Lending Related” in Note 17 – Commitments and Contingencies included in Part II. Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for complete description of Trustmark’s ACL methodology on off-balance sheet credit exposures.

Adjustments to the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures are recorded to PCL, off-balance sheet credit exposures.  At December 31, 2024, the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures totaled $29.4 million compared to $34.1 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $4.7 million, or 13.7%.  The PCL, off-balance sheet credit exposures totaled a negative $4.7 million for 2024, compared to a negative PCL, off-balance sheet credit exposures of $2.8 million for 2023 and a PCL, off-balance sheet credit exposures of $1.2 million for 2022.  The release in PCL, off-balance sheet credit exposures for 2024 primarily reflected a decrease in required reserves as a result of changes in the total reserve rate coupled with a decrease in unfunded commitments which was partially offset by an increase in required reserves as a result of implementing the Performance Trend and the External Factor-Credit Quality Review qualitative reserve factors.

Nonaccrual LHFI

At December 31, 2024, nonaccrual LHFI totaled $80.1 million, or 0.60% of total LHFS and LHFI, reflecting a decrease of $19.9 million, or 19.9%, relative to December 31, 2023, primarily as a result of the sale of 1-4 family mortgage loans during the second quarter of 2024 as well as the resolution of three large nonaccrual commercial credits in the Texas and Alabama market regions, partially offset by mortgage loans placed on nonaccrual in the Mississippi market region and three large commercial credits placed on nonaccrual in the Alabama and Texas market regions. Trustmark's mortgage loans are primarily included in the Mississippi market region because these loans are centrally analyzed and approved as part of the mortgage line of business which is located in Jackson, Mississippi.

For additional information regarding nonaccrual LHFI, see the section captioned “Nonaccrual and Past Due LHFI” in Note 5 – LHFI and ACL, LHFI included in Part II. Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

Other Real Estate

Other real estate at December 31, 2024 decreased $950 thousand, or 13.8%, when compared with December 31, 2023, principally due to properties sold in Trustmark’s Mississippi and Alabama market regions as well as a write-down on a large commercial property in the Texas market region, partially offset by properties foreclosed in the Mississippi market region.

Net write-downs of other real estate increased $1.8 million during 2024 compared to an increase in net recoveries of other real estate of $161 thousand during 2023.  The increase in net write-downs of other real estate during 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to a write-down on a large commercial foreclosed property in the Texas market region.

Deposits

Trustmark’s deposits are its primary source of funding and consist primarily of core deposits from the communities Trustmark serves.  Deposits include interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing demand accounts, savings, MMDA, CDs and individual retirement accounts.  Total deposits were $15.108 billion at December 31, 2024 compared to $15.570 billion at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $461.6 million, or 3.0%, reflecting declines in both noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposits accounts.  During 2024, noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $124.1 million, or 3.9%, primarily due to a decline in commercial demand deposit accounts.  Interest-bearing deposits decreased $337.5 million, or 2.7%, during 2024, primarily due to intentional declines in public interest checking accounts and brokered deposits as well as a decline in consumer interest checking accounts, partially offset by growth in consumer MMDAs and commercial interest checking accounts and consumer CDs.

At December 31, 2024, Trustmark's total uninsured deposits were $5.359 billion, or 35.5% of total deposits, compared to $5.601 billion, or 36.0% of total deposits, at December 31, 2023.

Borrowings

Trustmark uses short-term borrowings, such as federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and short-term FHLB advances, to fund growth of earning assets in excess of deposit growth.  See the section captioned “Liquidity” for further discussion of the components of Trustmark’s excess funding capacity.

Federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements totaled $324.0 million at December 31, 2024 compared to $405.7 million at December 31, 2023, a decrease of $81.7 million, or 20.1%, principally due to a decrease in upstream federal funds purchased.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, $39.0 million and $35.7 million, respectively, represented customer related transactions, such as commercial sweep repurchase balances.  Trustmark had $285.0 million of upstream federal funds purchased at December 31, 2024, compared to $370.0 million at December 31, 2023.

Other borrowings totaled $301.5 million at December 31, 2024, a decrease of $181.7 million, or 37.6%, when compared with $483.2 million at December 31, 2023, principally due to a decline in outstanding short-term FHLB advances obtained from the FHLB of Dallas.

Benefit Plans

Defined Benefit Plans

As disclosed in Note 15 – Defined Benefit and Other Postretirement Benefits included in Part II. Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, Trustmark maintains a noncontributory tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan titled the Trustmark Corporation Pension Plan for Certain Employees of Acquired Financial Institutions (the Continuing Plan) to satisfy commitments made by Trustmark to associates covered through plans obtained in acquisitions.

62

At December 31, 2024, the fair value of the Continuing Plan’s assets totaled $2.7 million and was exceeded by the projected benefit obligation of $5.5 million by $2.8 million.  Net periodic benefit cost equaled $177 thousand in 2024, compared to $262 thousand in 2023 and $410 thousand in 2022.

The fair value of plan assets is determined utilizing current market quotes, while the benefit obligation and periodic benefit costs are determined utilizing actuarial methodology with certain weighted-average assumptions.  For 2024, 2023 and 2022, the process used to select the discount rate assumption under FASB ASC Topic 715, 
"Compensation-Retirement Benefits,"
 takes into account the benefit cash flow and the segmented yields on high-quality corporate bonds that would be available to provide for the payment of the benefit cash flow.  Assumptions, which have been chosen to represent the estimate of a particular event as required by GAAP, have been reviewed and approved by Management based on recommendations from its actuaries.

The range of potential contributions to the Continuing Plan is determined annually by the Continuing Plan’s actuary in accordance with applicable IRS rules and regulations.  Trustmark’s policy is to fund amounts that are sufficient to satisfy the annual minimum funding requirements and do not exceed the maximum that is deductible for federal income tax purposes.  The actual amount of the contribution is determined annually based on the Continuing Plan’s funded status and return on plan assets as of the measurement date, which is December 31.  For the plan year ending December 31, 2024, Trustmark’s minimum required contribution to the Continuing Plan was $127 thousand; however, Trustmark contributed $290 thousand, $163 thousand in excess of the minimum required.  For the plan year ending December 31, 2025, Trustmark’s minimum required contribution to the Continuing Plan is expected to be $109 thousand; however, Management and the Board of Directors of Trustmark will monitor the Continuing Plan throughout 2025 to determine any additional funding requirements by the plan’s measurement date.

Supplemental Retirement Plans

As disclosed in Note 15 – Defined Benefit and Other Postretirement Benefits included in Part II. Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, Trustmark maintains a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan covering key executive officers and senior officers as well as directors who have elected to defer fees.  The plan provides for retirement and/or death benefits based on a participant’s covered salary or deferred fees.  Although plan benefits may be paid from Trustmark’s general assets, Trustmark has purchased life insurance contracts on the participants covered under the plan, which may be used to fund future benefit payments under the plan.  The annual measurement date for the plan is December 31.  As a result of mergers prior to 2014, Trustmark became the administrator of nonqualified supplemental retirement plans, for which the plan benefits were frozen prior to the merger dates.

At December 31, 2024, the accrued benefit obligation for the supplemental retirement plans equaled $38.2 million, while the net periodic benefit cost equaled $2.4 million in 2024, $2.5 million in 2023 and $2.4 million in 2022.  The net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation are determined using actuarial assumptions as of the plans’ measurement date.  The process used to select the discount rate assumption under FASB ASC Topic 715 takes into account the benefit cash flow and the segmented yields on high-quality corporate bonds that would be available to provide for the payment of the benefit cash flow.  At December 31, 2024, unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs continue to be amortized over future service periods.

Legal Environment

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Information required in this section is set forth under the heading “Lending Related” of Note 17 – Commitments and Contingencies in Part II. Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

Trustmark places a significant emphasis on the maintenance of a strong capital position, which promotes investor confidence, provides access to funding sources under favorable terms and enhances Trustmark’s ability to capitalize on business growth and acquisition opportunities. Higher levels of liquidity, however, bear corresponding costs, measured in terms of lower yields on short-term, more liquid earning assets and higher expenses for extended liability maturities. Trustmark manages capital based upon risks and growth opportunities as well as regulatory requirements. Trustmark utilizes a capital model in order to provide Management with a monthly tool for analyzing changes in its strategic capital ratios. This allows Management to hold sufficient capital to provide for growth opportunities and protect the balance sheet against sudden adverse market conditions, while maintaining an attractive return on equity to shareholders.

63

At December 31, 2024, Trustmark’s total shareholders’ equity was $1.962 billion, an increase of $300.5 million, or 18.1%, when compared to December 31, 2023.  The increase in shareholders’ equity during 2024 was primarily as a result of net income of $223.0 million as well as an increase in the fair market value of available for sale securities, net of tax, of $126.8 million and a decrease in the unrealized net holding losses on securities transferred from available for sale to held to maturity, net of tax, of $10.9 million, partially offset by common stock dividends of $56.8 million.

Regulatory Capital

Trustmark and TNB are subject to minimum risk-based capital and leverage capital requirements, as described in the section captioned “Capital Adequacy” included in Part I. Item 1. – Business of this report, which are administered by the federal bank regulatory agencies.  These capital requirements, as defined by federal regulations, involve quantitative and qualitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet instruments.  Trustmark’s and TNB’s minimum risk-based capital requirements include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%.  AOCI is not included in computing regulatory capital.  Trustmark elected the five-year phase-in transition period (through December 31, 2024) related to adopting FASB ASU 2016-13 for regulatory capital purposes.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the financial statements of Trustmark and TNB and limit Trustmark’s and TNB’s ability to pay dividends.  At December 31, 2024, Trustmark and TNB exceeded all applicable minimum capital standards.  In addition, Trustmark and TNB met applicable regulatory guidelines to be considered well-capitalized at December 31, 2024.  To be categorized in this manner, Trustmark and TNB maintained minimum common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios, and were not subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by their primary federal regulators to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measures.  There are no significant conditions or events that have occurred since December 31, 2024, which Management believes have affected Trustmark’s or TNB’s present classification.

In 2020, Trustmark enhanced its capital structure with the issuance of $125.0 million of subordinated notes.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023,

the carrying amount of the subordinated notes was $123.7 million and $123.5 million, respectively.  The subordinated notes mature December 1, 2030 and are redeemable at Trustmark’s option under certain circumstances.  For regulatory capital purposes, the subordinated notes qualified as Tier 2 capital for Trustmark at December 31, 2024 and 2023.  Trustmark may utilize the full carrying value of the subordinated notes as Tier 2 capital until December 1, 2025 (five years prior to maturity).  Beginning December 1, 2025, the subordinated notes will phase out of Tier 2 capital 20.0% each year until maturity.

In 2006, Trustmark enhanced its capital structure with the issuance of trust preferred securities.  For regulatory capital purposes, the trust preferred securities qualified as Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2024 and 2023.  Trustmark intends to continue to utilize $60.0 million in trust preferred securities issued by the Trust as Tier 1 capital up to the regulatory limit, as permitted by the grandfather provision in the Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel III Final Rule.

Refer to the section captioned “Regulatory Capital” included in Note 18 – Shareholders’ Equity in Part II. Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for an illustration of Trustmark’s and TNB’s actual regulatory capital amounts and ratios under regulatory capital standards in effect at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Dividends on Common Stock

Dividends per common share for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $0.92.  Trustmark’s dividend payout ratio for 2024, 2023 and 2022 was 25.21%, 33.95%, and 78.63%, respectively.  The increase in the dividend payout ratio for 2022 was principally due to the $100.8 million of litigation settlement expense recorded during the fourth quarter of 2022.  Since Trustmark is a holding company and does not conduct operations, its primary source of liquidity are dividends paid from TNB and borrowings from outside sources.  Approval by TNB’s regulators is required if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net income for that year combined with its retained net income of the preceding two years.  In 2025, TNB will have available approximately $255.3 million plus its net income for that year to pay as dividends to Trustmark.  The actual amount of any dividends declared in 2025 by Trustmark will be determined by Trustmark’s Board of Directors.  Trustmark’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share payable of March 15, 2025, to shareholders of record on March 1, 2025.

Stock Repurchase Plan

From time to time, Trustmark’s Board of Directors has authorized stock repurchase plans.  In general, stock repurchase plans allow Trustmark to proactively manage its capital position and return excess capital to shareholders.  Shares purchased also provide Trustmark with shares of common stock necessary to satisfy obligations related to stock compensation awards.  Under the stock repurchase plan effective January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022, Trustmark repurchased approximately 789 thousand shares of its common stock valued at $24.6 million.  Under the stock repurchase plan effective January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023, Trustmark did not

64

repurchase any of its outstanding common stock.  Under the stock repurchase plan effective January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024, Trustmark repurchased approximately 203 thousand shares of its common stock valued at $7.5 million.  On December 3, 2024, Trustmark’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program effective January 1, 2025, under which $100.0 million of Trustmark’s outstanding shares may be acquired through December 31, 2025. The repurchase program, which is subject to market conditions and management discretion, will be implemented through open market repurchases or privately negotiated transactions. Under this authority, Trustmark repurchased approximately 243 thousand shares of its common stock valued at $8.5 million during January 2025.

Liquidity

Liquidity is the ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demand for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs and other corporate purposes.  Consistent cash flows from operations and adequate capital provide internally generated liquidity.  Furthermore, Management maintains funding capacity from a variety of external sources to meet daily funding needs, such as those required to meet deposit withdrawals, loan disbursements and security settlements.  Liquidity strategy also includes the use of wholesale funding sources to provide for the seasonal fluctuations of deposit and loan demand and the cyclical fluctuations of the economy that impact the availability of funds.  Management keeps excess funding capacity available to meet potential demands associated with adverse circumstances.

The asset side of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through maturities and cash flows from loans and securities as well as the ability to pledge or sell certain loans and securities.  The liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through noninterest and interest-bearing deposits.  Trustmark utilizes federal funds purchased, FHLB advances, securities sold under repurchase agreements, the Discount Window and brokered deposits to provide additional liquidity.  Access to these additional sources represents Trustmark’s incremental borrowing capacity.

Trustmark’s liquidity position is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to manage the balance as deemed appropriate.  Liquidity risk management is an important element to Trustmark’s asset/liability management process.  Trustmark regularly models liquidity stress scenarios to assess potential liquidity outflows or funding problems resulting from economic disruptions or other significant occurrences as deemed appropriate by Management.  These scenarios are incorporated into Trustmark’s contingency funding plan, which provides the basis for the identification of its liquidity needs.

Deposit accounts represent Trustmark’s largest funding source.  Average deposits totaled to $15.366 billion for 2024 and represented approximately 82.8% of average liabilities and shareholders’ equity, compared to average deposits of $14.935 billion, which represented 80.0% of average liabilities and shareholders’ equity for 2023.

Trustmark had $297.3 million held in an interest-bearing account at the FRBA at December 31, 2024, compared to $712.0 million at December 31, 2023.  Trustmark efficiently managed its FRBA balance to lower levels during 2024.

Trustmark utilizes brokered deposits to supplement other wholesale funding sources.  At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, brokered sweep MMDA deposits totaled $10.6 million.  In addition, Trustmark had $250.0 million of brokered CDs at December 31, 2024 compared to $578.8 million at December 31, 2023.  Trustmark lowered its brokered deposits during 2024 as it managed its balance sheet and controlled deposit costs.

At December 31, 2024, Trustmark had $285.0 million of upstream federal funds purchased compared to $370.0 million of upstream federal funds purchased at December 31, 2023.  Trustmark maintains adequate federal funds lines to provide sufficient short-term liquidity.

Trustmark maintains a relationship with the FHLB of Dallas, which provided $200.0 million of outstanding short-term advances and no long-term advances at December 31, 2024, compared to $400.0 million of short-term and no long-term FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2023.  Under the existing borrowing agreement, Trustmark had sufficient qualifying collateral to increase FHLB advances with the FHLB of Dallas by $4.292 billion at December 31, 2024.

In addition, at December 31, 2024, Trustmark had no short-term and no long-term FHLB advances outstanding with the FHLB of Atlanta, compared to no short-term and $58 thousand in long-term FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2023, which were acquired in the BancTrust merger in 2013.  Trustmark had non-member status and thus no additional borrowing capacity with the FHLB of Atlanta.

Additionally, Trustmark has the ability to leverage its unencumbered investment securities as collateral.  At December 31, 2024, Trustmark had approximately $1.107 billion available in unencumbered Treasury and agency securities compared to $842.0 million at December 31, 2023.

65

Another borrowing source is the Discount Window.  At December 31, 2024, Trustmark had approximately $1.187 billion available in collateral capacity at the Discount Window primarily from pledges of commercial and industrial LHFI, compared with $1.374 billion at December 31, 2023.

During 2020, Trustmark issued $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.625% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023,

the carrying amount of the subordinated notes was $123.7 million and $123.5 million, respectively.  The subordinated notes mature December 1, 2030 and are redeemable at Trustmark’s option under certain circumstances.  The subordinated notes are unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to all of Trustmark’s existing and future senior indebtedness, whether secured or unsecured.  The subordinated notes are obligations of Trustmark only and are not obligations of, and are not guaranteed by, any of its subsidiaries, including TNB.

During 2006, Trustmark completed a private placement of $60.0 million of trust preferred securities through a newly formed Delaware trust affiliate, the Trust.  The trust preferred securities mature September 30, 2036 and are redeemable at Trustmark’s option.  The proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities were used by the Trust to purchase $61.9 million in aggregate principal amount of Trustmark’s junior subordinated debentures.

The Board of Directors of Trustmark currently has the authority to issue up to 20.0 million preferred shares with no par value.  The ability to issue preferred shares in the future will provide Trustmark with additional financial and management flexibility for general corporate and acquisition purposes.  At December 31, 2024, Trustmark had no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding.

Management believes that Trustmark has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet presently known cash flow requirements arising from ongoing business transactions.  As of December 31, 2024, Management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources or operations. In addition, Management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity that would have a material adverse effect on Trustmark.

In the ordinary course of business, Trustmark has entered into contractual obligations and has made other commitments to make future payments.  Please refer to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II. Item 8. – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report for the expected timing of such payments as of December 31, 2024.  These include payments related to (i) short-term and long-term borrowings (Note 12 – Borrowings), (ii) operating and finance leases (Note 10 – Leases), (iii) time deposits with stated maturity dates (Note 11 – Deposits) and (iv) commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit (Note 17 – Commitments and Contingencies).

Asset/Liability Management

Overview

Market risk reflects the potential risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and market prices.  Trustmark has risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk.  Trustmark’s primary market risk is interest rate risk created by core banking activities.  Interest rate risk is the potential variability of the income generated by Trustmark’s financial products or services, which results from changes in various market interest rates.  Market rate changes may take the form of absolute shifts, variances in the relationships between different rates and changes in the shape or slope of the interest rate term structure.

Following the LIBOR cessation date of June 30, 2023, the nationwide process for replacing LIBOR in financial contracts that mature thereafter and that do not provide for an effective means to replace LIBOR upon its cessation took effect pursuant to the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act.  For contracts in which a party has the discretion to identify a replacement rate, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act also provides a safe harbor to parties if they choose the SOFR-based benchmark replacement rate to be identified by the FRB.  Trustmark had a significant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that were either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR.  As December 31, 2024, all of Trustmark’s LIBOR exposure was remediated.  The transition from LIBOR could create costs and additional risk.  Trustmark cannot predict what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be; however, Trustmark has implemented various measures to manage the transition and mitigate risks.  For additional information regarding the transition from LIBOR and Trustmark’s management of this transition, please see the respective risk factor included in Part I. Item 1A. – Risk Factors of this report.

Management continually develops and applies cost-effective strategies to manage these risks.  Management’s Asset/Liability Committee sets the day-to-day operating guidelines, approves strategies affecting net interest income and coordinates activities within policy limits established by the Board of Directors of Trustmark.  A key objective of the asset/liability management program is to quantify, monitor and manage interest rate risk and to assist Management in maintaining stability in the net interest margin under varying interest rate environments.

66

Derivatives

Trustmark uses financial derivatives for management of interest rate risk.  Management’s Asset/Liability Committee, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate risk, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies.  The most common derivatives employed by Trustmark are interest rate lock commitments, forward contracts (both futures contracts and options on futures contracts), interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and interest rate floors.  As a general matter, the values of these instruments are designed to be inversely related to the values of the assets that they hedge (
i.e
., if the value of the hedged asset falls, the value of the related hedge rises).  In addition, Trustmark has entered into derivatives contracts as counterparty to one or more customers in connection with loans extended to those customers.  These transactions are designed to hedge interest rate, currency or other exposures of the customers and are not entered into by Trustmark for speculative purposes.  Increased federal regulation of the derivatives markets may increase the cost to Trustmark to administer derivatives programs.

Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments

Trustmark engages in a cash flow hedging program to add stability to interest income and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for Trustmark making variable-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount.  Interest rate floor spreads designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts if interest rates fall below the purchased floor strike rate on the contract and payments of variable rate amounts if interest rates fall below the sold floor strike rate on the contract.  Trustmark uses such derivatives to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing and anticipated variable-rate loan assets.  At December 31, 2024, the aggregate notional value of Trustmark's interest rate swaps and floor spreads designated as cash flow hedges totaled $1.500 billion compared to $1.125 billion at December 31, 2023.

Trustmark records any gains or losses on these cash flow hedges in AOCI.  Gains and losses on derivatives representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized over the life of the hedge on a systematic and rational basis, as documented at hedge inception in accordance with Trustmark’s accounting policy election.  The earnings recognition of excluded components totaled $474 thousand of amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $57 thousand of amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2023, and is included in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI.  As interest payments are received on Trustmark's variable-rate assets, amounts reported in AOCI are reclassified into interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI in the accompanying consolidated statements of income during the same period.  For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, Trustmark reclassified a loss, net of tax, of $13.6 million and $12.3 million, respectively, into interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI.  During the next twelve months, Trustmark estimates that $8.1 million will be reclassified as a reduction to interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI.  This amount could differ due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations or the addition of other hedges.

Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments

As part of Trustmark’s risk management strategy in the mortgage banking business, various derivative instruments such as interest rate lock commitments and forward sales contracts are utilized.  Rate lock commitments are residential mortgage loan commitments with customers, which guarantee a specified interest rate for a specified period of time.  Trustmark’s obligations under forward contracts consist of commitments to deliver mortgage loans, originated and/or purchased, in the secondary market at a future date.  The gross notional amount of Trustmark’s off-balance sheet obligations under these derivative instruments totaled $162.1 million at December 31, 2024, with a positive valuation adjustment of $908 thousand, compared to $171.4 million, with a negative valuation adjustment of $150 thousand at December 31, 2023.

Trustmark utilizes a portfolio of exchange-traded derivative instruments, such as Treasury note futures contracts and option contracts, to achieve a fair value return that economically hedges changes in the fair value of the MSR attributable to interest rates.  These transactions are considered freestanding derivatives that do not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP.  The total notional amount of these derivative instruments was $311.5 million at December 31, 2024 compared to $285.0 million at December 31, 2023.  These exchange-traded derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as noninterest income in mortgage banking, net and are offset by the changes in the fair value of the MSR.  The MSR fair value represents the present value of future cash flows, which among other things includes decay and the effect of changes in interest rates.  Ineffectiveness of hedging the MSR fair value is measured by comparing the change in value of hedge instruments to the change in the fair value of the MSR asset attributable to changes in interest rates and other market driven changes in valuation inputs and assumptions.  The impact of this strategy resulted in a net negative ineffectiveness of $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a net negative ineffectiveness of $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and a net negative ineffectiveness of $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Trustmark offers certain interest rate derivatives products directly to qualified commercial lending clients seeking to manage their interest rate risk under loans they have entered into with TNB.  Trustmark economically hedges interest rate swap transactions executed

67

with commercial lending clients by entering into offsetting interest rate swap transactions with institutional derivatives market participants.  Derivatives transactions executed as part of this program are not designated as qualifying hedging relationships under GAAP and are, therefore, carried on Trustmark’s financial statements at fair value with the change in fair value recorded as noninterest income in bank card and other fees.  Because these derivatives have mirror-image contractual terms, in addition to collateral provisions which mitigate the impact of non-performance risk, the changes in fair value are expected to substantially offset.  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange rules legally characterize variation margin collateral payments made or received for centrally cleared interest rate swaps as settlements rather than collateral.  As a result, centrally cleared interest rate swaps included in other assets and other liabilities are presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  At December 31, 2024, Trustmark had interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $1.819 billion related to this program, compared to $1.500 billion at December 31, 2023.

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features

Trustmark has agreements with its financial institution counterparties that contain provisions where if Trustmark defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then Trustmark could also be deemed to be in default on its derivatives obligations.

At December 31, 2024, the termination value of interest rate swaps in a liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements was $568 thousand compared to $1.4 million at December 31, 2023.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Trustmark had posted collateral of $1.5 million and $2.0 million, respectively, against its obligations because of negotiated thresholds and minimum transfer amounts under these agreements.  If Trustmark had breached any of these triggering provisions at December 31, 2024, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value (which is expected to approximate fair market value).

Credit risk participation agreements arise when Trustmark contracts with other financial institutions, as a guarantor or beneficiary, to share credit risk associated with certain interest rate swaps.  These agreements provide for reimbursement of losses resulting from a third-party default on the underlying swap.  At December 31, 2024, Trustmark had entered into eleven risk participation agreements as a beneficiary with and aggregate notional amount of $83.9 million compared to six risk participation agreements as a beneficiary with an aggregate notional amount of $40.1 million at December 31, 2023.  At December 31, 2024, Trustmark had entered into twenty-eight risk participation agreements as a guarantor with an aggregate notional amount of $229.1 million, compared to thirty-five risk participation agreements as a guarantor with an aggregate notional amount of $304.7 million at December 31, 2023.  The aggregate fair values of these risk participation agreements were immaterial at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Trustmark’s participation in the derivatives markets is subject to increased federal regulation of these markets.  Trustmark believes that it may continue to use financial derivatives to manage interest rate risk and also to offer derivatives products to certain qualified commercial lending clients in compliance with the Volcker Rule.  However, the increased federal regulation of the derivatives markets has increased the cost to Trustmark of administering its derivatives programs.  Some of these costs (particularly compliance costs related to the Volcker Rule and other federal regulations) are expected to recur in the future.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT
IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market/Interest Rate Risk Management

The primary purpose in managing interest rate risk is to invest capital effectively and preserve the value created by the core banking business.  This is accomplished through the development and implementation of lending, funding, pricing and hedging strategies designed to maximize net interest income performance under varying interest rate environments subject to specific liquidity and interest rate risk guidelines.

Financial simulation models are the primary tools used by Management’s Asset/Liability Committee to measure interest rate exposure.  The significant increase in short-term market interest rates and the overall interest rate environment is likely to affect the balance sheet composition and rates.  The simulation incorporates assumptions regarding the effects of such changes based on a combination of historical analysis and expected behavior.  Using a wide range of scenarios, Management is provided with extensive information on the potential impact on net interest income caused by changes in interest rates.  Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Trustmark’s balance sheet.  Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of Trustmark’s balance sheet, resulting from both strategic plans and customer behavior.  In addition, the model incorporates Management’s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth, pricing, prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates.

68

Based on the results of the simulation models using static balances, the table below summarizes the effect various one-year interest rate shift scenarios would have on net interest income compared to a base case, flat scenario at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Management cannot provide any assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on net interest income.  The estimates provided do not include the effects of possible strategic changes in the balances of various assets and liabilities throughout 2025 or additional actions Trustmark could undertake in response to changes in interest rates.  Management will continue to prudently manage the balance sheet in an effort to control interest rate risk and maintain profitability over the long term.

Another component of interest rate risk management is measuring the economic value-at-risk for a given change in market interest rates.  The economic value-at-risk may indicate risks associated with longer-term balance sheet items that may not affect net interest income at risk over shorter time periods.  Trustmark uses computer-modeling techniques to determine the present value of all asset and liability cash flows (both on- and off-balance sheet), adjusted for prepayment expectations, using a market discount rate.  The economic value of equity (EVE), also known as net portfolio value, is defined as the difference between the present value of asset cash flows and the present value of liability cash flows.  The resulting change in EVE in different market rate environments, from the base case scenario, is the amount of EVE at risk from those rate environments.

The following table summarizes the effect that various interest rate shifts would have on net portfolio value at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Trustmark determines the fair value of the MSR using a valuation model administered by a third party that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income.  The model incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income, including estimates of prepayment speeds, discount rate, default rates, cost to service (including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income and other ancillary income such as late fees.  Management reviews all significant assumptions quarterly. Mortgage loan prepayment speeds, a key assumption in the model, is the annual rate at which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage loan principal.  The discount rate used to determine the present value of estimated future net servicing income, another key assumption in the model, is an estimate of the required rate of return investors in the market would require for an asset with similar risk.  Both assumptions can, and generally will, change as market conditions and interest rates change.

By way of example, an increase in either the prepayment speed or discount rate assumption will result in a decrease in the fair value of the MSR, while a decrease in either assumption will result in an increase in the fair value of the MSR.  In recent years, there have been significant market-driven fluctuations in loan prepayment speeds and discount rates.  These fluctuations can be rapid and may continue to be significant.  Therefore, estimating prepayment speed and/or discount rates within ranges that market participants would use in determining the fair value of the MSR requires significant management judgment.

At December 31, 2024, the MSR fair value was $139.3 million, compared to $131.9 million at December 31, 2023.  The impact on the MSR fair value of a 10% adverse change in prepayment speeds or a 100-basis point increase in discount rates at December 31, 2024 would be a decline in fair value of approximately $4.9 million and $5.6 million, respectively, compared to a decline in fair value of approximately $4.8 million and $5.4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023.  Changes of equal magnitude in the opposite direction would produce similar increases in fair value in the respective amounts.

ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMEN
TS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Trustmark Corporation

Jackson, Mississippi

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Trustmark Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework: (2013) issued by COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.   Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.  Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.  The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Allowance for Credit Losses, LHFI Reasonable and Supportable Forecasts

As described in Note 1 - Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 – LHFI and ACL, LFHI to the consolidated financial statements, the Company uses a third-party software application to calculate the quantitative portion of the allowance for credit losses, which employs a discounted cash flow (DCF) or weighted average remaining maturity (WARM) method by loan pool. A reasonable and supportable forecast is developed through a Loss Driver Analysis (LDA) by loan class. The LDA uses charge off data from Trustmark National Bank’s Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) reports to construct a periodic default rate (PDR).  The PDR is decomposed into a probability of default (PD).  Regressions are run using the data for various macroeconomic variables in order to determine which correlate to the Company’s losses. These variables are then incorporated into the application to calculate a quarterly PD using a third-party baseline forecast. Loss given default (LGD) is derived from a method that traces the relationship between LGD and PD over a period of time and projects LGD based on the PD forecast.  This model approach is applicable to all pools within the construction, land development and other land, other secured by 1-4 family residential properties, secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties and other real estate secured loan classes, as well as all other consumer and other loans pools.  For commercial and industrial loan pools, the Company uses its own PD and LGD data. The Company utilizes a third-party bond default study to derive the PD and LGD for the obligations of state and political subdivisions pool.

The Company determined that reasonable and supportable forecasts could be made for a twelve-month period for all of its loan pools in which models were developed through the LDA. To the extent the lives of the loans in the LHFI portfolio extend beyond this forecast period, Trustmark uses a reversion period of four quarters and reverts to the historical mean on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the loans.

Estimating reasonable and supportable forecasts requires significant judgment and could have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements. Management leverages economic projections from an independent third party for its forecasts over the forecast period. We identified auditing the reasonableness of forecasts, including the LDA, as a critical audit matter as it involves especially subjective auditor judgment and increased audit effort, including the involvement of specialists.

The primary audit procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following:

Tested the effectiveness of controls over the LDA and reasonable and supportable forecast including:

•
Relevance and reliability of the underlying data including FFIEC data.

•
Model validation performed by a third-party specialist.

•
Reasonableness of significant assumptions and judgments applied in the forecast and results of the calculation.

Performed substantive testing over the LDA and reasonable and supportable forecast including:

•
Tested relevance and reliability of underlying data including FFIEC data.

•
Utilized the work of internal specialists to assist in evaluating the appropriateness and mathematical accuracy of the LDA, methodologies applied, and the relevance and reliability of data used in the development of the forecast models.

•
Evaluated the reasonableness of significant assumptions and judgments.

We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2015, which is the year the engagement letter was signed for the audit of the 2016 financial statements.

Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies
Business
Trustmark Corporation (Trustmark) is a bank holding company headquartered in Jackson, Mississippi.  Through its subsidiaries, Trustmark operates as a financial services organization providing banking and financial solutions to corporate institutions and individual customers through offices in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas.
Basis of Financial Statement Presentation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Trustmark and all other entities in which Trustmark has a controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and income and expense during the reporting periods and the related disclosures.  Although Management’s estimates contemplate current conditions and how they are expected to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that in 2025 actual conditions could vary from those anticipated, which could affect Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Securities
Securities are classified as either held to maturity or available for sale.  Securities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost when Management has the positive intent and the ability to hold them until maturity.  Securities to be held for indefinite periods of time are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value, with the unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.  Securities available for sale are used as part of Trustmark’s interest rate risk management strategy and may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, changes in prepayment rates and other factors.  Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase.
The amortized cost of debt securities classified as securities held to maturity or securities available for sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity of the security using the interest method.  Such amortization or accretion is included in interest on securities.  Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included in noninterest income as securities gains (losses), net.
Securities transferred from the available for sale category to the held to maturity category are recorded at fair value at the date of transfer.  Unrealized holding gains or losses associated with the transfer of securities from available for sale to held to maturity are included in the balance of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, in the consolidated balance sheets.  These unrealized holding gains or losses are amortized over the remaining life of the security as a yield adjustment in a manner consistent with the amortization or accretion of the original purchase premium or discount on the associated security.
Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 326 requires a current expected credit losses methodology for estimating allowances for credit losses and applies to all financial instruments carried at amortized cost, including securities held to maturity, and makes targeted improvements to the accounting for credit losses on securities available for sale.

Under FASB ASC Topic 326, the ACL is an estimate measured using relevant information about past events, including historical credit loss experience on financial assets with similar risk characteristics, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the remaining cash flows over the contractual term of the financial assets.
Trustmark adopted a zero-credit loss assumption for certain classes of securities.  This zero-credit loss assumption applies to debt issuances of the U.S. Treasury and agencies and instrumentalities of the United States government.  The reasons behind the adoption of the zero-credit loss assumption were as follows:
•
High credit rating
•
Long history with no credit losses
•
Guaranteed by a sovereign entity
•
Widely recognized as “risk-free rate”

77

•
Ability and authority to print its own currency
•
Currency is routinely held by central banks, used in international commerce, and commonly viewed as reserve currency
•
Currently under the U.S. Government conservatorship or receivership
Trustmark continuously monitors any changes in economic conditions, credit downgrades, changes to explicit or implicit guarantees granted to certain debt issuers, and any other relevant information that would indicate potential credit deterioration and prompt Trustmark to reconsider its zero-credit loss assumption.
Securities Available for Sale
FASB ASC Subtopic 326-30, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses-Available-for-Sale Debt Securities,” replaced the concept of other-than-temporarily impaired with the ACL.  Unlike securities held to maturity, securities available for sale are evaluated on an individual level and pooling of securities is not allowed.

Quarterly, Trustmark evaluates if any security has a fair value less than its amortized cost.  Once these securities are identified, in order to determine whether a decline in fair value resulted from a credit loss or other factors, Trustmark performs further analysis as outlined below:

•
Review the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost and observe the security’s lowest credit rating as reported by third-party credit ratings companies.
•
The securities that violate the credit loss triggers above would be subjected to additional analysis that may include, but is not limited to: changes in market interest rates, changes in securities credit ratings, security type, service area economic factors, financial performance of the issuer/or obligor of the underlying issue and third-party guarantee. 
•
If Trustmark determines that a credit loss exists, the credit portion of the allowance will be measured using a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis using the effective interest rate as of the security’s purchase date. The amount of credit loss Trustmark records will be limited to the amount by which the amortized cost exceeds the fair value.
The DCF analysis utilizes contractual maturities, as well as third-party credit ratings and cumulative default rates published annually by Moody’s Investor Service (Moody’s).
Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses for securities available for sale and reported in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
Securities Held to Maturity
FASB ASC Subtopic 326-20, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses-Measured at Amortized Cost,” requires institutions to measure expected credit losses on financial assets carried at amortized cost on a collective or pool basis when similar risks exist.  Trustmark uses several levels of segmentation to measure expected credit losses for its held to maturity securities:

•
The portfolio is segmented into agency and non-agency securities. 
•
The non-agency securities are separated into municipal, mortgage, and corporate securities. 
•
Each individual segment is categorized by third-party credit ratings.  
As discussed above, Trustmark has determined that for certain classes of securities it would be appropriate to assume the expected credit loss to be 
zero
, which include debt issuances of the U.S. Treasury and agencies and instrumentalities of the United States government.  This assumption is reviewed and attested to quarterly.  Trustmark uses an internally built model to verify the accuracy of third-party provided calculations.
Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses for securities held to maturity and included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
Trustmark monitors the credit quality of securities held to maturity on a monthly basis through credit ratings.

LHFS
Trustmark's LHFS portfolio consists of mortgage loans purchased from wholesale customers or originated in Trustmark’s General Banking Segment.  Trustmark has elected to account for its LHFS under the fair value option permitted by FASB ASC Topic 825, “Financial Instruments,” with interest income on the LHFS reported in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI.  Trustmark reports unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of the LHFS accounted for under the fair value option as noninterest income in mortgage banking, net.  LHFS are actively managed and monitored and certain market risks of the loans may be mitigated through the use of derivatives.  These derivative instruments are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value reported as noninterest income in mortgage banking, net.  Changes in the fair value of the LHFS are largely offset by changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments.  Election of the fair value option allows Trustmark to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for its LHFS at the lower of cost or fair value and the derivative instruments at fair value.  Realized gains and losses upon ultimate sale of the loans are reported as noninterest income in mortgage banking, net.
Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) optional repurchase programs allow financial institutions to buy back individual delinquent mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the institution provides servicing.  At the servicer’s option and without GNMA’s prior authorization, the servicer may repurchase such a delinquent loan for an amount equal to 
100
 percent of the remaining principal balance of the loan.  Under FASB ASC Topic 860, “Transfers and Servicing,” this buy-back option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met, at which time the option becomes unconditional.  When Trustmark is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans under the unconditional buy-back option, the loans can no longer be reported as sold and must be brought back onto the balance sheet as LHFS, regardless of whether Trustmark intends to exercise the buy-back option.  These loans are reported as LHFS with the offsetting liability being reported as short-term borrowings.  The fair value option election does not apply to the GNMA optional repurchase loans which do not meet the requirements under FASB ASC Topic 825 to be accounted for under the fair value option.
Trustmark defers the upfront loan fees and costs related to the LHFS.  In general, the LHFS are only retained on Trustmark’s balance sheet for 
30
 to 
45 days
 before they are pooled and sold in the secondary market.  The difference between deferring these loan fees and costs until the loans are sold and recognizing them in earnings as incurred as required by FASB ASC Subtopic 825-10 is considered immaterial.  Deferred loan fees and costs are reflected in the basis of the LHFS and, as such, impact the resulting gain or loss when the loans are sold.
LHFI
LHFI are loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off and are reported at amortized cost net of the ACL.  Amortized cost is the amount of unpaid principal, adjusted for the net amount of direct costs and nonrefundable loan fees associated with lending.  The net amount of nonrefundable loan origination fees and direct costs associated with the lending process, including commitment fees, is deferred and accreted to interest income over the lives of the loans using a method that approximates the interest method.  Interest on LHFI is accrued and recorded as interest income based on the outstanding principal balance.
Past due LHFI are loans contractually past due 
30
 days or more as to principal or interest payments.  A LHFI is classified as nonaccrual, and the accrual of interest on such loan is discontinued, when the contractual payment of principal or interest becomes 
90
 days past due on commercial credits and 
120
 days past due on non-business purpose credits.  In addition, a credit may be placed on nonaccrual at any other time Management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest according to the contractual terms, even though the loan is currently performing.  A LHFI may remain in accrual status if it is in the process of collection and well-secured.  When a LHFI is placed in nonaccrual status, interest accrued but not received is reversed against interest income.  Interest payments received on nonaccrual LHFI are applied against principal under the cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual status.  Under the cost-recovery method, interest income is not recognized until the principal balance is reduced to zero.  LHFI are restored to accrual status when the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt and the obligation has either been brought current or has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time.
Purchased Credit Deteriorated (PCD) Loans
Purchased loans which have experienced more than insignificant credit deterioration since origination are considered PCD loans.  An initial ACL for PCD loans is determined at acquisition using the same ACL methodology as the LHFI.  The initial ACL determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual loans.  PCD loans are reported at the amortized cost, which equals the loan purchased price plus the initial ACL.  The difference between the amortized cost basis of the PCD loan and the par value of the loan is the noncredit premium or discount, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan.  Subsequent changes to the ACL are recorded through the PCL, LHFI.

79

Upon adoption of FASB ASC Topic 326, Trustmark elected to maintain pools of loans that were previously accounted for under FASB ASC Subtopic 310-30, “Receivables-Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality,” and will continue to account for these pools as a unit of account.  Loans are only removed from the existing loan pools if they are written off, paid off or sold.  Upon adoption of FASB ASC Topic 326, the ACL was determined for each pool and added to the pool’s carrying value to establish a new amortized cost basis.  The difference between the unpaid principal balance of the pool and the new amortized cost basis is the noncredit premium or discount which will be amortized into interest income over the remaining life of the pool.  Changes to the ACL after adoption of FASB ASC Topic 326 are recorded through the PCL, LHFI.
ACL
LHFI
Trustmark’s ACL methodology for LHFI is based upon guidance within FASB ASC Subtopic 326-20 as well as applicable regulatory guidance.  The ACL on LHFI is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans.  Credit quality within the LHFI portfolio is continuously monitored by Management and is reflected within the ACL on LHFI.  The ACL on LHFI is an estimate of expected losses inherent within Trustmark’s existing LHFI portfolio.  The ACL on LHFI is adjusted through the PCL, LHFI and reduced by the charge off of loan amounts, net of recoveries.

The loan loss estimation process involves procedures to appropriately consider the unique characteristics of Trustmark’s LHFI portfolio segments.  These segments are further disaggregated into loan classes, the level at which credit risk is estimated.  When computing allowance levels, credit loss assumptions are estimated using a model that categorizes loan pools based on loss history, delinquency status and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future.  Evaluations of the portfolio and individual credits are inherently subjective, as they require estimates, assumptions and judgments as to the facts and circumstances of particular situations.  Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by Management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  In future periods, evaluations of the overall LHFI portfolio, in light of the factors and forecasts then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and credit loss expense.
Trustmark estimates the ACL on LHFI using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  Trustmark uses a third-party software application to calculate the quantitative portion of the ACL on LHFI using a methodology and assumptions specific to each loan pool.  The qualitative portion of the allowance is based on general economic conditions and other internal and external factors affecting Trustmark as a whole as well as specific LHFI.  Factors considered include the following:  lending policies and procedures, economic conditions and concentrations of credit, nature and volume of the portfolio, performance trends, and external factors.  The quantitative and qualitative portions of the allowance are added together to determine the total ACL on LHFI, which reflects Management’s expectations of future conditions based on reasonable and supportable forecasts.
The methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the ACL on LHFI has two basic components: a collective, or pooled, component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics, and an asset-specific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans.  In estimating the ACL for the collective component, loans are segregated into loan pools based on loan product types and similar risk characteristics.
Trustmark determined that reasonable and supportable forecasts could be made for a twelve-month period for all of its loan pools.  To the extent the lives of the loans in the LHFI portfolio extend beyond this forecast period, Trustmark uses a reversion period of four quarters and reverts to the historical mean on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the loans.
The ACL for individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans is measured as the difference between the discounted value of expected future cash flows, based on the effective interest rate at origination, and the amortized cost basis of the loan, or the net realizable value.  The ACL is the difference between the loan’s net realizable value and its amortized cost basis (net of previous charge-offs and deferred loan fees and costs), except for collateral-dependent loans.  A loan is collateral dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially through the sale of the collateral.  The expected credit loss for collateral-dependent loans is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the loan and the fair value of the collateral, adjusted for the estimated cost to sell.  Fair value estimates for collateral-dependent loans are derived from appraised values based on the current market value or the ‘as is’ value of the collateral, normally from recently received and reviewed appraisals.  Current appraisals are ordered on an annual basis based on the inspection date or more often if market conditions necessitate.  Appraisals are obtained from state-certified appraisers and are based on certain assumptions, which may include construction or development status and the highest and best use of the property.  These appraisals are reviewed by Trustmark’s Appraisal Review Department to ensure they are acceptable, and values are adjusted down for costs associated with asset disposal.  If the calculated expected credit loss is determined to be permanent or not recoverable, the amount of the expected credit loss is charged off.

80

Accrued interest receivable is not included in the amortized cost basis of Trustmark’s LHFI and, therefore, excluded from the estimate of credit losses for LHFI.
LHFI are charged off against the ACL on LHFI, with any subsequent recoveries credited back to the ACL on LHFI account.  Recoveries may not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged off.  Trustmark’s Loan Policy Manual dictates the guidelines to be followed in determining when a loan is charged off.  Commercial purpose LHFI are charged off when a determination is made that the loan is uncollectible and continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted.  Consumer LHFI secured by 1-4 family residential real estate are generally charged off or written down to the fair value of the collateral less cost to sell at no later than 
180
 days of delinquency.  Non-real estate consumer purpose LHFI, including both secured and unsecured loans, are generally charged off by 
120
 days of delinquency.  Consumer revolving lines of credit and credit card debt are generally charged off on or prior to 
180
 days of delinquency.
ACL on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures
Under FASB ASC Subtopic 326-20, Trustmark is required to estimate expected credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures which are not unconditionally cancellable.  Trustmark maintains a separate ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit.
Expected credit losses for off-balance sheet credit exposures are estimated by calculating a commitment usage factor over the contractual period for exposures that are not unconditionally cancellable by Trustmark.  Trustmark calculates a loan pool level unfunded amount for the period.  Trustmark views the loan pools as either closed-ended or open-ended.  Closed-ended loan pools are those that typically fund up to 100% such as other construction and nonowner-occupied.  Open-ended loan pools are those that behave similar to a revolver such as the commercial and industrial and home equity line of credit loan pools.  In addition to the unfunded balances, Trustmark uses a funding rate for loan pools that are considered open-ended.  Trustmark calculates the funding rate of the open-ended loan pools each period.  In order to mitigate volatility and incorporate historical experience in the funding rate, Trustmark uses a twelve-quarter moving average.  For the closed-ended loan pools, Trustmark takes a conservative approach and uses a 100% funding rate.  The expected funding rate is applied to each pool’s unfunded commitment balances to ensure that reserves will be applied to each pool based on balances expected to be funded based upon historical levels.  In addition to the funding rate being applied to the unfunded commitment balance, a reserve rate is applied, which includes both quantitative and a majority of the qualitative aspects of the current period's expected credit loss rate.  During 2024, Management implemented a performance trends qualitative factor for unfunded commitments and an External Factor - Credit Quality Review qualitative factor for unfunded commitments.  For both qualitative factors, the same assumptions are applied in the unfunded commitment calculation that are used in the funded balance calculation with the only difference being the unfunded commitment calculation includes the funding rates for the unfunded commitments.  The reserves for these two qualitative factors are added to the other calculated reserve to get a total reserve for off-balance sheet credit exposures.  Adjustments to the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures are recorded to the PCL, off-balance sheet credit exposures.
No credit loss estimate is reported for off-balance sheet credit exposures that are unconditionally cancellable by Trustmark or for undrawn amounts under such arrangements that may be drawn prior to the cancellation of the arrangement.
Premises and Equipment, Net
Premises and equipment are reported at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation is charged to expense over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are up to 
thirty-nine years
 for buildings and 
three
 to 
ten years
 for furniture and equipment.  Leasehold improvements are amortized over the terms of the respective leases or the estimated useful lives of the improvements, whichever is shorter.  In cases where Trustmark has the right to renew the lease for additional periods, the lease term for the purpose of calculating amortization of the capitalized cost of the leasehold improvements is extended when Trustmark is “reasonably assured” that it will renew the lease.  Depreciation and amortization expenses are computed using the straight-line method.  Trustmark continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate that such long-lived assets have become impaired.  Measurement of any impairment of such long-lived assets is based on the fair values of those assets.

Branch closures and purchased land held for future branch expansion for more than five years are evaluated to determine if the related land, buildings and building improvements should be transferred to assets held for sale in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 360, “Property, Plant and Equipment.”  The property is transferred to assets held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less cost to sell.  An impairment loss is recorded at the time of transfer if the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value.  Impairment losses are recorded as noninterest expense in other expense.
MSR
Trustmark recognizes as assets the rights to service mortgage loans based on the estimated fair value of the MSR when loans are sold and the associated servicing rights are retained.  Trustmark has elected to account for the MSR at fair value.

81

The fair value of the MSR is determined using a valuation model administered by a third party that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income.  Estimates of fair value involve several assumptions, including the key valuation assumptions about market expectations of future prepayment rates, interest rates and discount rates which are provided by a third-party firm.  Prepayment rates are projected using an industry standard prepayment model.  The model considers other key factors, such as a wide range of standard industry assumptions tied to specific portfolio characteristics such as remittance cycles, escrow payment requirements, geographic factors, foreclosure loss exposure, VA no-bid exposure, delinquency rates and cost of servicing, including base cost and cost to service delinquent mortgages.  Prevailing market conditions at the time of analysis are factored into the accumulation of assumptions and determination of servicing value.
Trustmark economically hedges changes in the fair value of the MSR attributable to interest rates.  See the section titled “Derivative Financial Instruments – Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments” of this note for information regarding these derivative instruments.
Trustmark receives annual servicing fee income for loans serviced, which is recorded as noninterest income in mortgage banking, net.  The fees are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal or a fixed amount per loan and are recorded as income when earned.  Late fees and ancillary fees related to loan servicing are not considered material.
Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets
Trustmark accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other.”  Goodwill, which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of an acquired business, is not amortized but tested for impairment on an annual basis, which is October 1 for Trustmark, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment.
Identifiable intangible assets are acquired assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or legal rights or because the assets are capable of being sold or exchanged either on their own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability.  Trustmark’s identifiable intangible assets primarily relate to core deposits and borrower relationships.  These intangibles, which have definite useful lives, are amortized on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives.  In addition, these intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be reevaluated.  Trustmark also purchased banking charters in order to facilitate its entry into the states of Florida and Texas.  These identifiable intangible assets were amortized on a straight-line method over 
20
 years.
Other Real Estate
Other real estate includes assets that have been acquired in satisfaction of debt through foreclosure and is recorded at the fair value less cost to sell (estimated fair value) at the time of foreclosure.  Fair value is based on independent appraisals and other relevant factors.  When foreclosed real estate is received in full satisfaction of a loan, the amount, if any, by which the recorded amount of the loan exceeds the estimated fair value of the property is a loss charged against the ACL at the time of foreclosure.  If the recorded amount of the loan is less than the estimated fair value of the property, a credit is recorded to write-downs of other real estate at the time of foreclosure.

Other real estate is revalued on an annual basis or more often if market conditions necessitate.  An other real estate specific reserve may be recorded through other real estate expense for declines in fair value subsequent to foreclosure based on recent appraisals or changes in market conditions.  Subsequent to foreclosure, losses on the periodic revaluation of the property are charged against an existing other real estate specific reserve or as noninterest expense in other real estate expense if a reserve does not exist.  Costs of operating and maintaining the properties as well as gains or losses on their disposition are also included in other real estate expense as incurred.  Improvements made to properties are capitalized if the expenditures are expected to be recovered upon the sale of the properties.
Leases
Lessor Arrangements
Trustmark leases certain types of machinery and equipment to its commercial customers through sales-type and direct financing leases as part of its equipment financing portfolio.  Sales-type and direct financing leases are similar to other forms of installment lending in that lessors generally do not retain benefits and risks incidental to ownership of the property subject to the leases.  Such arrangements are essentially financing transactions that permit lessees to acquire and use property.  Trustmark does not have any significant operating leases in which it is the lessor.

82

As lessor, the sum of all minimum lease payments over the lease term and the estimated residual value, less unearned interest income, is recorded as the net investment in the lease on the commencement date and is included in LHFI on the consolidated balance sheets.  Interest income is accrued as earned over the term of the lease based on the net investment in the leases and is recognized in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI on the consolidated statements of income.  Certain fees or costs associated with lease originations are deferred and accreted or amortized to interest income over the life of the lease using the effective interest method.

Trustmark’s portfolio of sales-type and direct financing leases generally have remaining lease terms of three to ten years, some of which include renewal options and/or options for the lessee to purchase the leased property near or at the end of the lease term at either the residual value or a specified price.  Trustmark expects to sell or release the equipment at the end of the lease term.  Due to the structure of these leases, there is no selling profit or loss on these transactions.

Lessee Arrangements
Trustmark has certain contracts that it has identified as leases according to FASB ASC Topic 842, "Leases".  Trustmark classifies these leases as either operating or finance leases and recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.  The lease liability represents the present value of the lease payments that remain unpaid as of the commencement date and the right-of-use asset is the initial lease liability recognized for the lease plus any lease payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date as well as any initial direct costs less any lease incentives received.  Trustmark accounts for the lease and nonlease components separately as such amounts are readily determinable.

Trustmark’s finance leases consist of building and equipment leases.  Trustmark recognizes interest expense based on the discount rate of the lease as interest expense in other interest expense and recognizes depreciation expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term as noninterest expense in net occupancy – premises for building leases and in equipment expense for equipment leases.  Trustmark amortizes the right-of-use asset over the life of the lease term on a straight-line basis.  Trustmark’s lease liabilities are measured as the present value of the remaining lease payments throughout the lease term.  Trustmark records its finance lease right-of-use assets in premises and equipment, net and its finance lease liabilities in other borrowings.

Trustmark’s operating leases primarily consist of building and land leases.   Trustmark recognizes lease rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease contract and records it as noninterest expense in net occupancy – premises for building and land leases and in equipment expense for equipment leases.  Trustmark’s amortization of the right-of-use asset is the difference between the straight-line lease expense and the interest expense recognized on the lease liability during the period.  Trustmark’s lease liabilities are measured as the present value of the remaining lease payments throughout the lease term.
Trustmark’s leases typically have one or more renewal options included in the lease contract.  Due to the nature of Trustmark’s leases, for leases with renewal options available, Trustmark considers the first renewal option as reasonably certain to renew and is therefore included in the measurement of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.

In order to calculate its right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, FASB ASC Topic 842 requires Trustmark to use the rate of interest implicit in the lease when readily determinable.  If the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, Trustmark is required to use its incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate of interest Trustmark would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term in a similar economic environment.  Trustmark was able to determine the implicit interest rate for its equipment leases and used that rate as its discount rate.  Since the implicit interest rate for most of its building and land leases were not readily determinable, Trustmark used its incremental borrowing rate.

Trustmark made an accounting policy election to not recognize short-term leases (12 months or less) on the balance sheet.  Trustmark’s short-term leases primarily include automated teller machines.  For short-term leases, Trustmark recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta Stock
Trustmark accounts for its investments in FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta stock in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 942-325, “Financial Services-Depository and Lending-Investments-Other.”  FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank stock are equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value because its ownership is restricted and it lacks a market.  FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank stock are carried at cost and evaluated for impairment.  Trustmark’s investment in member bank stock is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023
, Trustmark’s investment in member bank stock totaled $
44.9
 million and $
54.4
 million, respectively.  The carrying value of Trustmark’s member bank stock gave rise to 
no
 other-than-temporary impairment for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Trustmark accounts for revenue from contracts with customers in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which provides that revenue be recognized in a manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration Trustmark expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services.  Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized either over time in a manner that depicts Trustmark’s performance, or at a point in time when control of the goods or services are transferred to the customer.  Trustmark’s noninterest income, excluding all of mortgage banking, net and securities gains (losses), net and portions of bank card and other fees and other, net, are considered within the scope of FASB ASC Topic 606.  Gains or losses on the sale of other real estate, which are included in Trustmark’s noninterest expense as other expense, are also within the scope of FASB ASC Topic 606.
General Banking Segment
Service Charges on Deposit Accounts
In general, deposit accounts represent contracts with customers with no fixed duration and can be terminated or modified by either party at any time without compensation to the other party.  According to FASB ASC Topic 606, a contract that can be terminated by either party without compensation does not exist for periods beyond the then-current period.  Therefore, deposit contracts are considered to renew day-to-day if not minute-to-minute.
Deposit contracts have a single continuous or stand-ready service obligation whereby Trustmark makes customer funds available for use by the customer as and when the customer chooses as well as other services such as statement rendering and online banking.  The specific services provided vary based on the type of deposit account.  These services are not individually distinct, but are distinct as a group, and therefore, constitute a single performance obligation which is satisfied over time and qualifies as a series of distinct service periods.
Trustmark receives a fixed service charge amount as consideration monthly for services rendered.  The service charge amount varies based on the type of deposit account.  Some of the service charge revenue is subject to refund provisions, which is variable consideration under the guidelines of FASB ASC Topic 606.  Trustmark has elected the ‘as-invoiced’ practical expedient permitted under FASB ASC Topic 606 for recognition of service charge revenue.  Therefore, revenue is recognized at the time and in the amount the customer is charged.  The service charge revenue is presented net of refunded amounts on Trustmark’s consolidated statements of income.
Services related to non-sufficient funds, overdrafts, excess account activity, stop payments, dormant accounts, etc. are considered optional purchases for a deposit contract because there is no performance obligation for Trustmark until the service is requested by the customer or the occurrence of a triggering event.  Fees for these services are fixed amounts and are charged to the customer when the service is performed.  Revenue is recognized at the time the customer is charged.
Bank Card and Other Fees
Revenue from contracts with customers in bank card and other fees includes income related to interchange fees and various other contracts which primarily consists of contracts with a single performance obligation that is satisfied at a point in time.  Trustmark receives a fixed consideration amount once the performance obligation is completed for these contracts.  Trustmark reports revenue from these contracts net of amounts refunded or due to a third party.
As both a debit and credit card issuer, Trustmark receives an interchange fee for every card transaction completed by its customers with a merchant.  Trustmark receives 
two
 types of interchange fees: point-of-sale transactions in which the customer must enter the PIN associated with the card to complete the transaction (a debit card transaction), and signature transactions in which the signature of the customer is required to complete the transaction (a credit card transaction).
Trustmark, as the card issuing or settlement bank, has a contract (implied based on customary business practices) with the payment network in which Trustmark has a single continuous service obligation to make funds available for settlement of the card transaction.  Trustmark’s service obligation is satisfied over time and qualifies as a series of distinct service periods.  Trustmark receives interchange fees as consideration for services rendered in the amount established by the respective payment network.  The interchange fees are established by the payment network based on the type of transaction and is posted on their website.  Trustmark receives and records interchange fee revenue from the payment networks daily net of all fees and amounts due to the payment network.
Other Income
Revenue from contracts with customers in other income includes income related to cash management services and other contracts with a single performance obligation that is satisfied at a point in time.  Trustmark receives a fixed consideration amount once the performance

obligation is completed for these contracts.  Trustmark reports revenue from these contracts net of amounts refunded or due to a third party.
Trustmark provides cash management services through the delivery of various products and services offered to its business and municipal customers including various departments of state, city and local governments, universities and other non-profit entities.  Similar to the deposit account contracts, the cash management contracts primarily represent contracts with customers with no fixed duration and can be terminated or modified by either party at any time without compensation to the other party.  Therefore, cash management contracts are generally considered to renew day-to-day if not minute-to-minute.

Cash management contracts have a single continuous or stand-ready service obligation whereby Trustmark makes a specific service or group of services available for use by the customer as and when the customer chooses.  The specific services provided vary based on the type of account or product.  These services are not individually distinct, but are distinct as a group, and therefore, constitute a single performance obligation which is satisfied over time and qualifies as a series of distinct service periods.
Trustmark receives a set service charge or maintenance fee amount as consideration monthly for services rendered.  However, some of the fees are based on the number of transactions that occur (
i.e.,
 flat fee for a set number of transactions per month then an additional charge for each transaction after that) or the average daily account balance maintained by the customer during the month and a small amount of the cash management fee revenue is subject to refund provisions.  These fees represent variable consideration under the guidelines of FASB ASC Topic 606.  Trustmark has elected the ‘as-invoiced’ practical expedient permitted under FASB ASC Topic 606 for recognition of cash management fee revenue.  The cash management revenue is presented net of any refunded amounts on Trustmark’s consolidated statements of income.
Trustmark’s merchant services provider contracts directly with Trustmark business customers and provides Trustmark’s merchant customers card processing equipment and transaction processing services.  Trustmark’s contract with the merchant services provider has a single-continuous service obligation to provide customer referrals for potential new accounts which is satisfied over time and qualifies as a series of distinct service periods.  Trustmark receives a flat fee for each new account established and a percentage of the residual income related to transactions processed for Trustmark’s merchant customers each month as provided in the contract.  Under the guidelines of FASB ASC Topic 606, the fee received for each new account and the profit sharing represent variable consideration.  Revenue from merchant card services contracts is recognized monthly using a time-elapsed measure of progress.  Trustmark has elected the ‘as-invoiced’ practical expedient permitted under FASB ASC Topic 606 for recognition of the merchant card services revenue.
Other Real Estate
Trustmark records a gain or loss from the sale of other real estate when control of the property transfers to the buyer.  Trustmark records the gain or loss from the sale of other real estate in noninterest expense as other expense.  Other real estate sales for the year ended December 31, 2024
 resulted in a net loss of $
1.1
 million compared to a net loss of $
145
 thousand for the year ended 
December 31, 2023
 and  a net loss of $
1.0
 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2022.
In general, purchases of Trustmark’s other real estate property are not financed by Trustmark.  Financing the purchase of other real estate is evaluated based upon the same lending policies and procedures as all other types of loans.  Under FASB ASC Subtopic 610-20, “Other Income – Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets,” when Trustmark finances the sale of its other real estate to a buyer, Trustmark is required to assess whether the buyer is committed to perform their obligations under the contract and whether collectability of the transaction price is probable.  Once these two criteria are met, Trustmark derecognizes the other real estate asset and records a gain or loss on the sale once control of the property is transferred to the buyer.
Wealth Management Segment
Trust Management
There are 
four
 categories of revenue included in trust management: personal trust and investments, retirement plan services, institutional custody and other.  Each of these categories includes multiple types of contracts, service obligations and fee income.  However, the majority of these contracts include a single service obligation that is satisfied over time, the customer is charged in arrears for services rendered and revenue is recognized when payment is received.  In general, the time period between when the service obligation is completed and when payment from the customer is received is less than 
30
 days.  Revenue from trust management contracts is primarily related to monthly service periods and based on the prior month-end’s market value.  Some trust management revenue is mandated by a court order, while other revenue consists of flat fees.  Trust management revenue based on an account’s market value represents variable consideration under the guidelines of FASB ASC Topic 606.  Trustmark has elected the ‘as-invoiced’ practical expedient allowed under FASB ASC Topic 606 to account for the trust management revenue.

85

Assets under administration held by Trustmark in a fiduciary or agency capacity for customers are not included in Trustmark’s consolidated balance sheets.
Investment Services
Investment services includes both brokerage and annuity income.  Trustmark has a contract with a third-party investment services company which contains a single continuous service obligation, to provide broker-dealer and advisory services to customers on behalf of the third-party, which is satisfied over time and qualifies as a series of distinct service periods.  Trustmark serves as the agent between the third-party investment services company, the principle, and the customer.  In accordance with the contract, Trustmark receives a monthly payment from the investment services company for commissions and advisory fees (asset management fees) earned on transactions completed in the prior month net of all charges and fees due to the investment services company.  Trustmark recognizes revenue from the investment services company, net of the revenue sharing expense due to the investment services company, when the payments are received.  Commissions vary from month-to-month based on the specific products and transactions completed.  The advisory fees vary based on the average daily balance of the managed assets for the period.  The commissions and advisory fees represent variable consideration under FASB ASC Topic 606.  Trustmark has elected the ‘as-invoiced’ practical expedient allowed under FASB ASC Topic 606 to recognize revenue from the investment services company.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Trustmark maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility.  Trustmark’s interest rate risk management strategy involves modifying the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates do not adversely affect the net interest margin and cash flows.  Under the guidelines of FASB ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” all derivative instruments are required to be recognized as either assets or liabilities and carried at fair value on the balance sheet.  The fair value of derivative positions outstanding is included in other assets and/or other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and in the net change in these financial statement line items in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows as well as included in noninterest income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  Trustmark’s interest rate derivative instruments are subject to master netting agreements, and therefore, eligible for offsetting in the consolidated balance sheets.  Trustmark has elected to not offset any derivative instruments in its consolidated balance sheets.
Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments
FASB ASC Topic 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
 (ASC 815), provides the disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging activities with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how the entity accounts for derivative instruments and related hedged items, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. Further, qualitative disclosures are required that explain the objectives and strategies for using derivatives, as well as quantitative disclosures about the fair value of and gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative instruments.
Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge.
When entering into a hedge transaction, Trustmark formally documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, which includes designating the derivative instrument as a fair value or cash flow hedge to a specific asset or liability on the balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions and the risk being hedged, along with a formal assessment at the inception of the hedge as to the effectiveness of the derivative instrument in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item.  Trustmark continues to assess hedge effectiveness on an ongoing basis using either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment (regression analysis).
As required by ASC 815, Trustmark records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.  The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether Trustmark has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting.  For cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently reclassified to net income in the same period that the hedged transaction impacts net

86

income.  Upon discontinuation of hedge accounting for cash flow hedges, any amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to that relationship affects earnings at the same time and in the same manner in which the hedged transaction affects earnings.  If it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, any related amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified to earnings immediately.
Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments
As part of Trustmark’s risk management strategy in the mortgage banking area, derivative instruments such as forward sales contracts are utilized.  Trustmark’s obligations under forward contracts consist of commitments to deliver mortgage loans, originated and/or purchased, in the secondary market at a future date.  Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded as noninterest income in mortgage banking, net and are offset by changes in the fair value of LHFS.  See Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies, “LHFS” for information regarding the fair value option election.
Trustmark also utilizes derivative instruments such as interest rate lock commitments in its mortgage banking area.  Rate lock commitments are residential mortgage loan commitments with customers, which guarantee a specified interest rate for a specified time period.  Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded as noninterest income in mortgage banking, net and are offset by the changes in the fair value of forward sales contracts.
Trustmark utilizes a portfolio of exchange-traded derivative instruments, such as Treasury note futures contracts and option contracts, to achieve a fair value return that economically hedges changes in the fair value of the MSR attributable to interest rates.  These transactions are considered freestanding derivatives that do not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting.  These exchange-traded derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as noninterest income in mortgage banking, net and are offset by changes in the fair value of the MSR.  The MSR fair value represents the present value of future cash flows, which among other things includes decay and the effect of changes in interest rates.  Ineffectiveness of hedging the MSR fair value is measured by comparing the change in the fair value of the hedge instruments to the change in the fair value of the MSR asset attributable to changes in interest rates and other market driven changes in valuation inputs and assumptions.
Trustmark offers certain derivatives products directly to qualified commercial lending clients seeking to manage their interest rate risk.  Trustmark economically hedges interest rate swap transactions executed with commercial lending clients by entering into offsetting interest rate swap transactions with institutional derivatives market participants.  Derivative transactions executed as part of this program are not designated as qualifying hedging relationships and are, therefore, carried at fair value with the change in fair value recorded as noninterest income in bank card and other fees.  Because these derivatives have mirror-image contractual terms, in addition to collateral provisions which mitigate the impact of non-performance risk, the changes in fair value are expected to substantially offset.  The offsetting interest rate swap transactions are either cleared through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for clearable transactions or booked directly with institutional derivatives market participants for non-clearable transactions.  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange rules legally characterize variation margin collateral payments made or received for centrally cleared interest rate swaps as settlements rather than collateral.  As a result, centrally cleared interest rate swaps included in other assets and other liabilities are presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Income Taxes
Trustmark accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions.  Under the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 740, Trustmark accounts for deferred income taxes using the liability method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of Trustmark’s assets and liabilities.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled and are presented net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in other assets.
Stock-Based Compensation
Trustmark accounts for the stock and incentive compensation under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation.”  Under this accounting guidance, fair value is established as the measurement objective in accounting for stock awards and requires the application of a fair value based measurement method in accounting for compensation cost, which is recognized over the requisite service period.  Trustmark has elected to account for forfeitures of stock awards as they occur.

Per Share Data
Trustmark accounts for per share data in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 260, “Earnings Per Share,” which provides that unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method.  Trustmark has determined that its outstanding unvested stock awards are not participating securities.  Based on this determination, no change has been made to Trustmark’s current computation for basic and diluted EPS.
Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding.  Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding, adjusted for the effect of potentially dilutive stock awards outstanding during the period.

Fair Value Measurements
FASB ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,” defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements.  The fair value of an asset or liability is the price that would be received to sell that asset or paid to transfer that liability in an orderly transaction occurring in the principal market (or most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market) for such asset or liability.  Depending on the nature of the asset or liability, Trustmark uses various valuation techniques and assumptions when estimating fair value.  Inputs to valuation techniques include the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.  FASB ASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.  The fair value hierarchy is as follows:
Level 1 Inputs – Valuation is based upon quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that Trustmark has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level 2 Inputs – Valuation is based upon quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities and default rates and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 Inputs – Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity’s own determination about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available.

88

In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety is classified is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  Trustmark’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.  Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are recognized on the actual date of the event or circumstances that caused the transfer.
Accounting Policies Recently Adopted
Except for the changes detailed below, Trustmark has consistently applied its accounting policies to all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.”
  Issued in November 2023, ASU 2023-07 is intended to improve disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments and address requests from investors and other allocators of capital for additional, more detailed information about a reportable segment’s expenses.  The amendments of ASU 2023-07 require a public entity to disclose, on an annual and interim basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, and an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition.  The other segment items category is the difference between segment revenue less the significant expenses disclosed and each reported measure of segment profit or loss.  ASU 2023-07 also requires a public entity to provide all annual disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets currently required under FASB ASC Topic 280 in interim periods.  The amendments of ASU 2023-07 clarify that if the CODM uses more than one measure of a segment's profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources, a public entity may report one or more of those additional measures of segment profit.  However, at least one of the reported segment profit or loss measures (or the single reported measure if only one is disclosed) should be the measure that is most consistent with the measurement principles used in measuring the corresponding amounts in the public entity's consolidated financial statements.  ASU 2023-07 requires a public entity to disclose the title and position of the CODM, together with an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources.  In addition, ASU 2023-07 requires that a public entity with a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments of ASU 2023-07 and all existing segment disclosures in FASB ASC Topic 280.  The amendments of ASU 2023-07 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.  The amendments in ASU 2023-07 should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented on the financial statements.  Upon implementation, the segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods should be based on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption.  Trustmark adopted the amendments of ASU 2023-07 related to annual disclosure requirements effective January 1, 2024, and the newly required annual disclosures are included in Note 21 – Segment Information of this report.  Trustmark adopted the amendments of ASU 2023-07 related to interim disclosure requirements effective January 1, 2025, and will present any newly required interim disclosures beginning with its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2025.  Adoption of ASU 2023-07 did not have a material impact to Trustmark’s consolidated financial statements or results of operations.
ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.”
  Issued in December 2023, ASU 2023-09 is intended to improve the disclosures for income taxes to address requests from investors, lenders, creditors and other allocators of capital (collectively, "investors") that use the financial statements to make capital allocation decisions.  During the FASB's 2021 agenda consultation process and other stakeholder outreach, investors highlighted that the current system of income tax disclosures does not provide enough information to understand the tax provision for an entity that operates in multiple jurisdictions.  Investors currently rely on the rate reconciliation table and other disclosures, including total income taxes paid in the statement of cash flows, to evaluate income tax risks and opportunities.  The amendments in ASU 2023-09 will require consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation disclosure as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction.  The amendments of ASU 2023-09 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance.  Trustmark adopted the amendments of ASU 2023-09 effective January 1, 2025, and will include the required disclosures in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2025.  Trustmark is currently evaluating the changes to disclosures required by ASU 2023-09; however, adoption of ASU 2023-09 is not expected to have a material impact to Trustmark’s consolidated financial statements or results of operations.
Pending Accounting Pronouncements
ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.”

Issued in November 2024, ASU 2024-03 with the objective of providing investors with more decision-useful information regarding a public business entity's expenses by enhancing disclosures on income statement expenses.  Investor feedback indicated a strong preference for the disclosure of disaggregated financial reporting information as a top priority for the FASB.  Detailed knowledge of an entity's expenses is crucial for understanding its prospects for future cash flows and

89

for 
making performance comparisons over time and with other entities.  Investors emphasized that information regarding cost of sales, selling, general, and administrative expenses, employee compensation costs, depreciation and amortization, and research and development expenditure would enhance their comprehension of an entity's cost structure and ability to forecast future cash flows.  The ASU applies exclusively to public business entities and mandates additional disclosures about specific expense categories on both annual and interim bases in the notes to financial statements that are not currently required. The amendments do not alter or eliminate existing expense disclosure requirements nor change requirements for presenting expenses on the face of the income statement. However, they do specify that certain existing disclosures must now appear in the same tabular format as the new disaggregation requirements.  The FASB issued ASU 2025-01 in January 2025, clarifying that the amendments in ASU 2024-03 are effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027.  Early adoption is permitted. Trustmark intends to adopt the amendments of ASU 2024-03 effective January 1, 2027, and will include the required annual disclosures in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2027, and required interim disclosures in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2028.  Trustmark is currently evaluating the changes to disclosures required by ASU 2024-03; however, adoption of ASU 2024-03 is not expected to have a material impact to Trustmark’s consolidated financial statements or results of operations.

Note 2 - Discontinued Operations
On May 31, 2024, Trustmark National Bank (TNB) completed the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary, Fisher Brown Bottrell Insurance, Inc. (FBBI), to Marsh & McLennan Agency LLC (MMA) for approximately $
336.9
 million in cash.  The transaction resulted in a pre-tax 
net gain
 of $
228.3
 million.  The gain, along with FBBI's historical financial results for periods prior to the sale, is reflected in Trustmark's consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations.  The assets and liabilities of FBBI have been presented as "Assets of discontinued operations" and "Liabilities of discontinued operations" on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023.  FBBI's operating results have been presented as "Discontinued operations" within the accompanying consolidated statements of income and prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.  Cash flows from both continuing and discontinued operations are included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
The following table summarizes financial information related to FBBI which has been segregated from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations for the periods presented ($ in thousands):

reserve requirement ratios to 
zero
 percent, eliminating the
 reserve requirements for all depository institutions, in order to provide liquidity in the banking system to support lending to households and businesses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

During 2022, Trustmark reclassified a total of $
766.0
 million of securities available for sale to securities held to maturity.  On the date of these transfers, the net unrealized holding loss on the available for sale securities totaled approximately $
91.9
 million ($
68.9
 million, net of tax).

The securities were transferred at fair value, which became the cost basis for the securities held to maturity.  The net unrealized holding loss will be amortized over the remaining life of the securities as a yield adjustment in a manner consistent with the amortization or accretion of the original purchase premium or discount on the associated security.  There were no gains or losses recognized as a result of these transfers.  At December 31, 2024
, the net unamortized, unrealized loss on transferred securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the accompanying balance sheet totaled $
46.6
 million 
compared to approximately 
$
57.6
 million 
at December 31, 2023.
ACL on Securities
Securities Available for Sale
Quarterly, Trustmark evaluates if any security has a fair value less than its amortized cost.  Once these securities are identified, in order to determine whether a decline in fair value resulted from a credit loss or other factors, Trustmark performs further analysis.  If Trustmark determines that a credit loss exists, the credit portion of the allowance is measured using a DCF analysis using the effective interest rate as of the security’s purchase date. The amount of credit loss Trustmark records will be limited to the amount by which the amortized cost exceeds the fair value.  The DCF analysis utilizes contractual maturities, as well as third-party credit ratings and cumulative default rates published annually by Moody’s.
At both December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the results of the loss analysis performed did not identify any securities that warranted DCF analysis and 
no
 credit loss was recognized on any of the securities available for sale.

Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses for securities available for sale.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023
, accrued interest receivable totaled $
5.0
 million and $
3.7
 million, respectively, for securities available for sale and was reported in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
Securities Held to Maturity
At December 31, 2024, Trustmark identified no securities held to maturity with the potential for credit loss exposure, compared to 
$
340
 thousand at December 31, 
2023
, which consisted of municipal securities.  After applying appropriate probability of default and loss given default assumptions, the total amount of current expected credit losses was 
zero
 at 
December 31, 2024
 and immaterial at December 31, 2023.  Therefore, 
no
 reserve was recorded at either December 31, 2024 or December 31, 
2023.

Accrued interest receivable is excluded from the estimate of credit losses for securities held to maturity.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023
, accrued interest receivable totaled $
2.4
 million and $
2.6
 million for securities held to maturity and was reported in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.
At both December 31, 2024 and 2023
, Trustmark had 
no
 securities held to maturity that were past due 30 days or more as to principal or interest payments.  Trustmark had 
no
 securities held to maturity classified as nonaccrual at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
.
Trustmark monitors the credit quality of securities held to maturity on a monthly basis through credit ratings.  
The following table presents the amortized cost of Trustmark’s securities held to maturity by credit rating, as determined by Moody’s, at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023 ($ in thousands):

The unrealized losses shown above are due to increases in market rates over the yields available at the time of purchase of the underlying securities and not credit quality.  Trustmark does not intend to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that Trustmark will not be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be at maturity.

Modified LHFI
Occasionally, Trustmark modifies loans for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties by providing payment concessions, interest-only payments for an extended period of time, maturity extensions or interest rate reductions.  Other concessions may arise from court proceedings or may be imposed by law.  In some cases, Trustmark provides multiple types of concessions on one loan.
The following tables present the amortized cost of LHFI at the end of each of the periods presented of loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty disaggregated by class of loan and type of modification ($ in thousands).  The percentage of the amortized cost basis of LHFI that were modified to borrowers in financial distress as compared to the amortized cost basis of each class of LHFI is also presented below

Trustmark had no unused commitments on modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty at December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, Trustmark had a payment concession balance of $
6.2
 million and a term extension balance of $
70
 thousand at default for LHFI in the commercial and industrial portfolio and the other secured by 1-4 family residential properties portfolio, respectively, that had a payment default and were modified within the twelve months prior to that default to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.  During the year ended December 31, 2023, Trustmark had payment concession balances of $
116
 thousand at default for LHFI in the other commercial loans and leases portfolio that had a payment default and were modified within the twelve months prior to that default to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.

97

Trustmark has utilized loans 90 days or more past due to define payment default in determining modified loans that have subsequently defaulted.  If Trustmark determines that a modified loan (or a portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is charged off against the ACL, LHFI.
Trustmark closely monitors the performance of loans that are modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to understand the effectiveness of its modification efforts.  
The following tables provide details of the performance of such LHFI that have been modified during the periods presented ($ in thousands):

A loan is collateral dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially through the sale of the collateral.  The following provides a qualitative description by class of loan of the collateral that secures Trustmark’s collateral-dependent LHFI:
•
Loans secured by real estate – Loans within these loan classes are secured by liens on real estate properties. During 2024, one collateral dependent relationship had a decrease in collateral value that secures the credit.  There have been no other significant changes to the collateral that secures these financial assets during the period.
•
Other loans secured by real estate – Loans within these loan classes are secured by liens on real estate properties. There have been no significant changes to the collateral that secures these financial assets during the period.
•
Commercial and industrial loans – Loans within this loan class are primarily secured by inventory, accounts receivables, equipment and other non-real estate collateral. During 2024, four relationships had decreases in collateral value that secures the credit.  There have been no other significant changes to the collateral that secures these financial assets during the period.
•
State and other political subdivision loans – Loans within this loan class are secured by liens on real estate properties or other non-real estate collateral. There have been no significant changes to the collateral that secures these financial assets during the period.
•
Other commercial loans and leases – Loans and leases within this loan class are secured by non-real estate collateral. There have been no significant changes to the collateral that secures these financial assets during the period.
Credit Quality Indicators
Trustmark’s LHFI portfolio credit quality indicators focus on 
six
 key quality ratios that are compared against bank tolerances.  The loan indicators are total classified outstanding, total criticized outstanding, nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets, delinquencies and net loan losses.  Due to the homogeneous nature of consumer loans, Trustmark does not assign a formal internal risk rating to each credit and therefore the criticized and classified measures are primarily composed of commercial loans.
In addition to monitoring portfolio credit quality indicators, Trustmark also measures how effectively the lending process is being managed and risks are being identified.  As part of an ongoing monitoring process, Trustmark grades the commercial portfolio segment as it relates to credit file completion and financial statement exceptions, underwriting, collateral documentation and compliance with law as shown below:
•
Credit File Completeness and Financial Statement Exceptions – evaluates the quality and condition of credit files in terms of content and completeness and focuses on efforts to obtain and document sufficient information to determine the quality and status of credits.  Also included is an evaluation of the systems/procedures used to ensure compliance with policy.
•
Underwriting – evaluates whether credits are adequately analyzed, appropriately structured and properly approved within loan policy requirements.  A properly approved credit is approved by adequate authority in a timely manner with all conditions of approval fulfilled.  Total policy exceptions measure the level of underwriting and other policy exceptions within a portfolio segment.
•
Collateral Documentation – focuses on the adequacy of documentation to perfect Trustmark’s collateral position and substantiate collateral value.  Collateral exceptions measure the level of documentation exceptions within a portfolio segment.  Collateral exceptions occur when certain collateral documentation is either not present or not current.

99

•
Compliance with Law – focuses on underwriting, documentation, approval and reporting in compliance with banking laws and regulations.  Primary emphasis is directed to the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), Regulation O requirements and regulations governing appraisals.
Commercial Credits
Trustmark has established a loan grading system that consists of ten individual credit risk grades (risk ratings) that encompass a range from loans where the expectation of loss is negligible to loans where loss has been established.  The model is based on the risk of default for an individual credit and establishes certain criteria to delineate the level of risk across the ten unique credit risk grades.  Credit risk grade definitions are as follows:
•
Risk Rate (RR) 1 through RR 6 – Grades one through six represent groups of loans that are not subject to criticism as defined in regulatory guidance. Loans in these groups exhibit characteristics that represent low to moderate risk measured by using a variety of credit risk criteria such as cash flow coverage, debt service coverage, balance sheet leverage, liquidity, management experience, industry position, prevailing economic conditions, support from secondary sources of repayment and other credit factors that may be relevant to a specific loan.  In general, these loans are supported by properly margined collateral and guarantees of principal parties.
•
Other Assets Especially Mentioned (Special Mention) (RR 7) – a loan that has a potential weakness that if not corrected will lead to a more severe rating.  This rating is for credits that are currently protected but potentially weak because of an adverse feature or condition that if not corrected will lead to a further downgrade.
•
Substandard (RR 8) – a loan that has at least one identified weakness that is well defined.  This rating is for credits where the primary sources of repayment are not viable at the time of evaluation or where either the capital or collateral is not adequate to support the loan and the secondary means of repayment do not provide a sufficient level of support to offset the identified weakness.  Loss potential exists in the aggregate amount of substandard loans but does not necessarily exist in individual loans.
•
Doubtful (RR 9) – a loan with an identified weakness that does not have a valid secondary source of repayment.  Generally, these credits have an impaired primary source of repayment and secondary sources are not sufficient to prevent a loss in the credit.  The exact amount of the loss has not been determined at this time.
•
Loss (RR 10) – a loan or a portion of a loan that is deemed to be uncollectible.
By definition, credit risk grades special mention (RR 7), substandard (RR 8), doubtful (RR 9) and loss (RR 10) are criticized loans while substandard (RR 8), doubtful (RR 9) and loss (RR 10) are classified loans.  These definitions are standardized by all bank regulatory agencies and are generally equally applied by each individual lending institution.  The remaining credit risk grades are considered pass credits and are solely defined by Trustmark.
To enhance this process, Trustmark has determined that certain loans will be individually assessed, and a formal analysis will be performed and based upon the analysis the loan will be written down to the net realizable value.  Trustmark will individually assess and remove loans from the pool in the following circumstances:
•
Commercial nonaccrual loans with total exposure of $
500
 thousand (excluding those portions of the debt that are government guaranteed or are secured by Trustmark deposits or marketable securities) or more.  
•
Any loan that is believed to not share similar risk characteristics with the rest of the pool will be individually assessed.  Otherwise, the loan will be left within the pool based on the results of the assessment.
•
Commercial accruing loans deemed to be a modified loan to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty with total exposure of $
500
 thousand (excluding those portions of the debt that are government guaranteed or are secured by Trustmark deposits or marketable securities) or more.  If the loan is believed to not share similar risk characteristics with the rest of the loan pool, the loan will be individually assessed.  Otherwise, the loan will be left within the pool and monitored on an ongoing basis
.
Each loan officer assesses the appropriateness of the internal risk rating assigned to their credits on an ongoing basis.  Trustmark’s Asset Review area conducts independent credit quality reviews of the majority of Trustmark’s commercial loan portfolio both on the underlying credit quality of each individual loan class as well as the adherence to Trustmark’s loan policy and the loan administration process.
In addition to the ongoing internal risk rate monitoring described above, 
Trustmark’s Credit Quality Review Committee meets monthly and performs a review of all loans of $
100
 thousand 
or more that are either delinquent 30 days or more or on nonaccrual.  This review

100

includes 
recommendations regarding risk ratings, accrual status, charge-offs and appropriate servicing officer as well as evaluation of problem credits for determination of modified status. Quarterly, the Credit Quality Review Committee reviews and modifies continuous action plans for all credits risk rated seven or worse for relationships of $250 thousand or more.

In addition, periodic reviews of significant development, construction, multi-family, nonowner-occupied and other commercial credits are performed.  These reviews assess each particular project with respect to location, project valuations, progress of completion, leasing status, current financial information, rents, operating expenses, cash flow, adherence to budget and projections and other information that is pertinent to the particular type of credit as applicable.  Summary results are reviewed by Senior and Regional Credit Officers in addition to the Chief Credit Officer with a determination made as to the appropriateness of existing risk ratings and accrual status.
Consumer Credits
The Retail Credit Review Committee, Management Credit Policy Committee and the Enterprise Risk Committee review the volume and percentage of consumer loan delinquencies and losses to monitor the overall quality of the consumer portfolio.
Trustmark monitors the levels and severity of past due consumer LHFI on a daily basis through its collection activities.  A detailed assessment of consumer LHFI delinquencies is performed monthly at both a product and market level.

ACL, LHFI
Trustmark’s ACL methodology for LHFI is based upon guidance within FASB ASC Subtopic 326-20 as well as applicable regulatory guidance.  The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans’ amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans.  Credit quality within the LHFI portfolio is continuously monitored by Management and is reflected within the ACL for LHFI.  The ACL is an estimate of expected losses inherent within Trustmark’s existing LHFI portfolio.  The ACL for LHFI is adjusted through the PCL, LHFI and reduced by the charge off of loan amounts, net of recoveries.

The methodology for estimating the amount of expected credit losses reported in the ACL has two basic components: a collective, or pooled, component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share similar risk characteristics, and an asset-specific component involving individual loans that do not share risk characteristics with other loans and the measurement of expected credit losses for such individual loans.  In estimating the ACL for the collective component, loans are segregated into loan pools based on loan product types and similar risk characteristics.
The loans secured by real estate and other loans secured by real estate portfolio segments include loans for both commercial and residential properties.  The underwriting process for these loans includes analysis of the financial position and strength of both the borrower and guarantor, experience with similar projects in the past, market demand and prospects for successful completion of the proposed project within the established budget and schedule, values of underlying collateral, availability of permanent financing, maximum loan-to-value ratios, minimum equity requirements, acceptable amortization periods and minimum debt service coverage requirements, based on property type.  The borrower’s financial strength and capacity to repay their obligations remain the primary focus of underwriting.  Financial strength is evaluated based upon analytical tools that consider historical and projected cash flows and performance in addition to analysis of the proposed project for income-producing properties.  Additional support offered by guarantors is also considered.  Ultimate repayment of these loans is sensitive to interest rate changes, general economic conditions, liquidity and availability of long-term financing.

107

The commercial and industrial LHFI portfolio segment includes loans within Trustmark’s geographic markets made to many types of businesses for various purposes, such as short-term working capital loans that are usually secured by accounts receivable and inventory and term financing for equipment and fixed asset purchases that are secured by those assets.  Trustmark’s credit underwriting process for commercial and industrial loans includes analysis of historical and projected cash flows and performance, evaluation of financial strength of both borrowers and guarantors as reflected in current and detailed financial information and evaluation of underlying collateral to support the credit.

The consumer LHFI portfolio segment is comprised of loans that are centrally underwritten based on the borrower's credit bureau score as well as an evaluation of the borrower’s repayment capacity, credit, and collateral. Property appraisals are obtained to assist in evaluating collateral. Loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios, loan amount, and lien position are also considered in assessing whether to originate a loan. These borrowers are particularly susceptible to downturns in economic trends such as conditions that negatively affect housing prices and demand and levels of unemployment.

The state and other political subdivision LHFI and the other commercial LHFI and leases portfolio segments primarily consist of loans to non-depository financial institutions, such as mortgage companies, finance companies and other financial intermediaries, loans to state and political subdivisions, and loans to non-profit and charitable organizations.  These loans are underwritten based on the specific nature or purpose of the loan and underlying collateral with special consideration given to the specific source of repayment for the loan. The lease segment primarily consists of commercial equipment finance leases. Trustmark’s credit underwriting process for equipment finance leases includes analysis of historical and projected cash flows and performance, evaluation of financial strength of both borrowers and guarantors as reflected in current and detailed financial information and evaluation of underlying collateral to support the credit.
During the first quarter of 2024 as part of Trustmark's ongoing model monitoring procedures the annual loss driver analysis was performed. The analysis resulted in changes in the loss drivers for all discounted cash-flow models along with changes in the loss drivers for the equipment and finance loans and leases model. These changes were a result of updating Trustmark's peer group and incorporating data through 2022 which led to more intuitive loss drivers. All models were validated by a third party before implementation.

In general, Trustmark utilizes a DCF method to estimate the quantitative portion of the ACL for loan pools.  The DCF model consists of two key components, a loss driver analysis (LDA) and a cash flow analysis.  For loan pools utilizing the DCF methodology, multiple assumptions are in place, depending on the loan pool.  A reasonable and supportable forecast is utilized for each loan pool by developing a LDA for each loan class.  The LDA uses charge off data from Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) reports to construct a periodic default rate (PDR).  The PDR is decomposed into a PD.  Regressions are run using the data for various

110

macroeconomic variables in order to determine which ones correlate to Trustmark’s losses. These variables are then incorporated into the application to calculate a quarterly PD using a third-party baseline forecast.  In addition to the PD, a LGD is derived using a method referred to as Frye Jacobs.  The Frye Jacobs method is a mathematical formula that traces the relationship between LGD and PD over time and projects the LGD based on the levels of PD forecasts.  This model approach is applicable to all pools within the construction, land development and other land, other secured by 1-4 family residential properties, secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties and other real estate secured loan classes as well as consumer loans and other commercial loans.
During 2022, Management elected to incorporate a methodology change related to the other construction pool. Components of this change include management utilizing an alternative LDA to support the PD and LGD assumptions necessary to apply a DCF methodology to the other construction pool. Fundamentally, this approach utilizes publicly reported default balances and leverages a generalized linear model (GLM) framework to estimate PD.  Taken together, these differences allow for results to be scaled to be specific and directly applicable to the other construction segment. LGD is assumed to be a through-the-cycle constant based on the actual performance of Trustmark’s other construction segment.  These assumptions are then input into the DCF model and used in conjunction with prepayment data to calculate the cash flows at the individual loan level. Previously, the other construction pool used the weighted average remaining maturity (WARM) method. Management believes this change is commensurate with the level of risk in the pool.
For the commercial and industrial loans related pools, Trustmark uses its own PD and LGD data, instead of the macroeconomic variables and the Frye Jacobs method described above, to calculate the PD and LGD as there were no defensible macroeconomic variables that correlated to Trustmark’s losses.  Trustmark utilizes a third-party Bond Default Study to derive the PD and LGD for the obligations of state and political subdivisions pool.  Due to the lack of losses within this pool, no defensible macroeconomic factors were identified to correlate.

The PD and LGD measures are used in conjunction with prepayment data as inputs into the DCF model to calculate the cash flows at the individual loan level.  Contractual cash flows based on loan terms are adjusted for PD, LGD and prepayments to derive loss cash flows.  These loss cash flows are discounted by the loan’s coupon rate to arrive at the discounted cash flow based quantitative loss.  The prepayment studies are updated quarterly by a third-party for each applicable pool.
An alternate method of estimating the ACL is used for certain loan pools due to specific characteristics of these loans.  For the non-DCF pools, specifically, those using the WARM method, the remaining life is incorporated into the ACL quantitative calculation.
During the second quarter of 2024, Trustmark executed a sale on a portfolio of 1-4 family mortgage loans that were at least three payments delinquent and/or nonaccrual at the time of selection. As a result of this sale, a credit mark was established for a sub-pool of the loans in the sale. Due to the lack of historical experience and the use of industry data for this sub-pool, management elected to use the credit mark for reserving purposes on a go forward basis for this sub-pool that meets the same credit criteria of being three payments delinquent and/or nonaccrual. All loans of the sub-pool that meet the above credit criteria will be removed from the 1-4 family residential properties pool and placed into a separate pool with the credit mark reserve applied to the total balance.

Trustmark determined that reasonable and supportable forecasts could be made for a twelve-month period for all of its loan pools.  To the extent the lives of the loans in the LHFI portfolio extend beyond this forecast period, Trustmark uses a reversion period of four quarters and reverts to the historical mean on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the loans.  The econometric models currently in production reflect segment or pool level sensitivities of PD to changes in macroeconomic variables.  By measuring the relationship between defaults and changes in the economy, the quantitative reserve incorporates reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions that will affect the value of Trustmark’s assets, as required by FASB ASC Topic 326.  Under stable forecasts, these linear regressions will reasonably predict a pool’s PD.  However, due to such events as the COVID-19 pandemic, the macroeconomic variables used for reasonable and supportable forecasting can change rapidly.  At the macroeconomic levels experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, it was not clear that the models in production at that time would produce reasonably representative results since the models at that time were originally estimated using data beginning in 2004 through 2019.  During this period, a traditional, albeit severe, economic recession occurred. Thus, econometric models are sensitive to similar future levels of PD.

In order to prevent the econometric models from extrapolating beyond reasonable boundaries of their input variables, Trustmark chose to establish an upper and lower limit process when applying the periodic forecasts.  In this way, Management will not rely upon unobserved and untested relationships in the setting of the quantitative reserve.  This approach applies to all input variables, including: Southern Unemployment, National Unemployment, National Gross Domestic Product (GDP), National Home Price Index (HPI), National Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Price Index and the BBB 7-10 Year US Corporate Bond Index (CBI).  The upper and lower limits are based on the distribution of the macroeconomic variable by selecting extreme percentiles at the upper and lower limits of the distribution, the 1
st 
and 99
th 
percentiles, respectively.  These upper and lower limits are then used to calculate the PD for the forecast time period in which the forecasted values are outside of the upper and lower limit range.  Additionally, when periods have a PD or LGD at or near zero as a result of the improving macroeconomic forecasts, Management implemented PD and LGD floors to account

111

for the risk associated with each portfolio.  The PD and LGD floors are based on Trustmark’s historical loss experience and applied at a portfolio level.

Qualitative factors used in the ACL methodology include the following:
•
Lending policies and procedures
•
Economic conditions and concentrations of credit
•
Nature and volume of the portfolio
•
Performance trends
•
External factors
While all these factors are incorporated into the overall methodology, only four are currently considered active at December 31, 2024: (i) economic conditions and concentrations of credit, (ii) nature and volume of the portfolio, (iii) performance trends and (iv) external factors.
Two of Trustmark’s largest loan classes are the loans secured by nonfarm, nonresidential properties and the loans secured by other real estate.  Trustmark elected to create a qualitative factor specifically for these loan classes which addresses changes in the economic conditions of metropolitan areas and applies additional pool level reserves.  This qualitative factor is based on third-party market data and forecast trends and is updated quarterly as information is available, by market and by loan pool.
Trustmark's current quantitative methodologies do not completely incorporate changes in credit quality.  As a result, Trustmark utilizes the performance trends qualitative factor. This factor is based on migration analyses, that allocates additional ACL to non-pass/delinquent loans within each pool. In this way, Management believes the ACL will directly reflect changes in risk, based on the performance of the loans within a pool, whether declining or improving.

The performance trends qualitative factor is estimated by properly segmenting loan pools into risk levels by risk rating for commercial credits and delinquency status for consumer credits. A migration analysis is then performed quarterly using a third-party software and the results for each risk level are compiled to calculate the historical PD average for each loan portfolio based on risk levels. This average historical PD rate is updated annually. For the mortgage portfolio, Trustmark uses an internal report to incorporate a roll rate method for the calculation of the PD rate. In addition to the PD rate for each portfolio, Management incorporates the quantitative rate and the k value derived from the Frye-Jacobs method to calculate a loss estimate that includes both PD and LGD. The quantitative rate is used to eliminate any additional reserve that the quantitative reserve already includes. Finally, the loss estimate rate is then applied to the total balances for each risk level for each portfolio to calculate a qualitative reserve.
During 2022, Management elected to activate the nature and volume of the portfolio qualitative factor as a result of a sub-pool of the secured by 1-4 family residential properties growing to a significant size along with the underlying nature being different as well. The nature and volume of the portfolio qualitative factor utilizes a WARM methodology that uses industry data for the assumptions to support the qualitative adjustment. The industry data is used to compile a PD based on credit score ranges along with using the industry data to compile an LGD. The sub-pool of credits is then aggregated into the appropriate credit score bands in which a weighted average loss rate is calculated based on the PD and LGD for each credit score range. This weighted average loss rate is then applied to the expected balance for the sub-segment of credits. This total is then used as the qualitative reserve adjustment.
The external factors qualitative factor is Management’s best judgment on the loan or pool level impact of all factors that affect the portfolio that are not accounted for using any other part of the ACL methodology (
e.g.
, natural disasters, changes in legislation, impacts due to technology and pandemics).  During the third quarter of 2024, Trustmark activated the External Factor – Credit Quality Review qualitative factor. This qualitative factor ensures reserve adequacy for collectively evaluated commercial loans that may not have been identified and downgraded timely for various reasons. This qualitative factor population is all commercial loans risk rated 1-5. These loans are then applied to the historical average of the Watch/Special Mention rated percentage. Then the balance of these loans are applied additional reserves based on the same reserve rates utilized in the performance trends qualitative factor for Watch/Special Mention rated loans. Then the Watch/Special Mention population is applied the historical Substandard rated percentage and then subsequently applied the Substandard reserve rate utilized in the performance trends qualitative factor as well. The historical Watch/Special Mention and Substandard rated percentage averages captures the weighted average life of the commercial loan portfolio. Thus, Trustmark will allocate additional reserves to capture the proportion of potential Watch/Special Mention and Substandard rated credits that may not have been categorized as such at any given point in time through the life of the commercial loan portfolio.

The PCL, LHFI for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily attributable to loan growth, changes in the macroeconomic forecast, an increase in specific reserves on individually analyzed credits and net adjustments to the qualitative factors.

The negative PCL, LHFI for the construction, land development and other land portfolio and other secured by 1-4 family residential properties portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to changes in the macroeconomic forecast associated with these specific loss driver models as a result of the loss driver update for these loan portfolios.  The negative PCL, LHFI for the other commercial loans and leases portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in loan balances.

Trustmark determines the fair value of the MSR using a valuation model administered by a third party that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income.  Trustmark considers the conditional prepayment rate (CPR), which is an estimated loan prepayment rate that uses historical prepayment rates for previous loans similar to the loans being evaluated, the float rate, which is the interest rate earned on escrow balances, and the discount rate as some of the primary assumptions used in determining the fair value of the MSR. An increase in either the CPR or discount rate assumption will result in a decrease in the fair value of the MSR, while a decrease in either assumption will result in an increase in the fair value of the MSR.  An increase in the float rate will result in an increase in the fair value of the MSR, while a decrease in the float rate will result in a decrease in the fair value of the MSR. At December 31, 2024
, the fair value of the MSR included an assumed average prepayment speed of 
8
 CPR and an average discount rate of 
10.65
% compared to an assumed average prepayment speed of 
9
 CPR and an average discount rate of 
10.07
% at 
December 31, 2023.
Mortgage Loans Sold/Serviced
During 2024, 2023 and 2022
, Trustmark sold $
1.141
 billion, $
1.136
 billion and $
1.243
 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans.  Gain on sales of loans, net totaled $
19.3
 million in 
2024
, $
15.3
 million in 
2023
 and $
20.2
 million in 
2022
.  Trustmark receives annual servicing fee income approximating 
0.32
% of the outstanding balance of the underlying loans, which totaled $
28.0
 million in 
2024
, $
26.9
 million in 
2023
 and $
26.0
 million in 
2022.  The gains on the sale of residential mortgage loans and the annual servicing fee are both recorded to noninterest income in mortgage banking, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.  The investors and the securitization trusts have no recourse to the assets of Trustmark for failure of debtors to pay when due.

Trustmark is subject to losses in its loan servicing portfolio due to loan foreclosures.  Trustmark has obligations to either repurchase the outstanding principal balance of a loan or make the purchaser whole for the economic benefits of a loan if it is determined that the loan sold was in violation of representations or warranties made by Trustmark at the time of the sale, herein referred to as mortgage loan servicing putback expenses.  Such representations and warranties typically include those made regarding loans that had missing or insufficient file documentation, loans that do not meet investor guidelines, loans in which the appraisal does not support the value and/or loans obtained through fraud by the borrowers or other third parties.  Generally, putback requests may be made until the loan is paid in full.  However, mortgage loans delivered to Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) on or after January 1, 2013 are subject to the Representations and Warranties Framework, which provides certain instances in which FNMA and FHLMC will not exercise their remedies, including a putback request, for breaches of certain selling representations and warranties, such as payment history and quality control review.
When a putback request is received, Trustmark evaluates the request and takes appropriate actions based on the nature of the request.  Trustmark is required by FNMA and FHLMC to provide a response to putback requests within 
60
 days of the date of receipt.  The total mortgage loan servicing putback expenses are included in other expense.
  At both December 31, 2024 and 2023
, Trustmark had a reserve for mortgage loan servicing putback expenses of $
500
 thousand.

There is inherent uncertainty in reasonably estimating the requirement for reserves against potential future mortgage loan servicing putback expenses.  Future putback expenses are dependent on many subjective factors, including the review procedures of the purchasers and the potential refinance activity on loans sold with servicing released and the subsequent consequences under the representations and warranties.  Trustmark believes that it has appropriately reserved for potential mortgage loan servicing putback requests.

2024
, compared to $
49.9
 million of interest expense in 
2023
 and $

At December 31, 2024 and 2023
, Trustmark had $
4.292
 billion and $
4.003
 billion, respectively, available in additional borrowing capacity from the FHLB of Dallas.
Subordinated Notes
During 2020, Trustmark agreed to issue and sell $
125.0
 million aggregate principal amount of its 
3.625
% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes (the Notes) due 
December 1, 2030
.  The Notes were sold at an underwriting discount of 
1.2
%, resulting in net proceeds to Trustmark of $
123.5
 million before deducting offering expenses.  At 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the carrying amount of the Notes was $
123.7
 million and $
123.5
 million, respectively.  The Notes are unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right of payment to all of Trustmark’s existing and future senior indebtedness, whether secured or unsecured.  The Notes are obligations of Trustmark only and are not obligations of, and are not guaranteed by, any of its subsidiaries, including TNB.  From the date of issuance until November 30, 2025, the Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 
3.625
% per year, payable 
semi-annually
 in 
arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year.  Beginning December 1, 2025, the Notes will bear interest at a floating rate per year equal to the Benchmark

121

rate, 
which is the 
Three-Month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)
, plus 
338.7
 basis points, payable 
quarterly
 in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1 of each year.  The Notes qualify as Tier 2 capital for Trustmark.  The Notes may be redeemed at Trustmark’s option under certain circumstances.  Trustmark intends to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.
Junior Subordinated Debt Securities
On August 18, 2006, Trustmark completed a private placement of $
60.0
 million of trust preferred securities through a newly formed Delaware trust affiliate, Trustmark Preferred Capital Trust I (the Trust).  The trust preferred securities mature 
September 30, 2036
, are redeemable at Trustmark’s option and bear interest at a variable rate per annum equal to the 
three-month Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (CME) SOFR
 plus a spread adjustment of 
0.26
% and a margin of 
1.72
%.  Under applicable regulatory guidelines, these trust preferred securities qualify as Tier 1 capital.  The proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities were used by the Trust to purchase $
61.9
 million in aggregate principal amount of Trustmark’s junior subordinated debentures.
The debentures were issued pursuant to a Junior Subordinated Indenture, dated August 18, 2006, between Trustmark, as issuer, and Wilmington Trust Company, National Association, as trustee.  Like the trust preferred securities, the debentures bear interest at a variable rate per annum equal to the three-month CME SOFR plus a spread adjustment of 
0.26
% and a margin of 
1.72
% and mature on 
September 30, 2036
.  The debentures may be redeemed at Trustmark’s option at any time.  The interest payments by Trustmark will be used to pay the quarterly distributions payable by the Trust to the holder of the trust preferred securities.  However, so long as no event of default has occurred under the debentures, Trustmark may defer interest payments on the debentures (in which case the Trust will also defer distributions otherwise due on the trust preferred securities) for up to 
20
 consecutive quarters.
The debentures are subordinated to the prior payment of any other indebtedness of Trustmark that, by its terms, is not similarly subordinated.  The trust preferred securities are recorded as a long-term liability on Trustmark’s balance sheet; however, for regulatory purposes the trust preferred securities are treated as Tier 1 capital under the rules of the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), Trustmark’s primary federal regulatory agency.
Trustmark also entered into a Guarantee Agreement, dated August 18, 2006, pursuant to which it has agreed to guarantee the payment by the Trust of distributions on the trust preferred securities and the payment of principal of the trust preferred securities when due, either at maturity or on redemption, but only if and to the extent that the Trust fails to pay distributions on or principal of the trust preferred securities after having received interest payments or principal payments on the junior subordinated debentures from Trustmark for the purpose of paying those distributions or the principal amount of the trust preferred securities.
As defined in applicable accounting standards, the Trust, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Trustmark, is considered a variable interest entity for which Trustmark is not the primary beneficiary.  Accordingly, the accounts of the Trust are not included in Trustmark’s consolidated financial statements.
At both December 31, 2024 and 2023
, assets for the Trust totaled $
61.9
 million, resulting from the investment in junior subordinated debentures issued by Trustmark.  Liabilities and shareholders’ equity for the Trust also totaled $
61.9
 million at both 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, resulting from the issuance of trust preferred securities in the amount of $
60.0
 million as well as $
1.9
 million in common securities issued to Trustmark.  During 
2024
, net income for the Trust equaled $
134
 thousand resulting from interest income from the junior subordinated debt securities issued by Trustmark to the Trust, compared with net income of $
132
 thousand during 
2023
 and $
66
 thousand during 
2022.  Dividends issued to Trustmark by the Trust during 2024
 totaled $
134
 thousand, compared to $
132
 thousand during 
2023
 and $
66
 thousand during 
2022
.

The strategic objective of the investments of the assets in the Continuing Plan aims to provide both income and potential capital appreciation.  The allocation is managed on a total return basis with the average participant age in mind.  It is well suited for moderately conservative investors seeking an ample level of income while also participating in equity markets.  This investment mix is designed to take advantage of rising stock markets while cushioning the effects of stock market downturns.  The portfolio is typically balanced between equity and fixed income.  The equity exposure has the potential to earn a return greater than inflation while the fixed income exposure may reduce the risk and volatility of the portfolio to which the equity mutual funds contribute.
Fair Value Measurements
At this time, Trustmark presents no fair values that are derived through internal modeling.  Should positions requiring fair valuation arise that are not relevant to existing methodologies, Trustmark will make every reasonable effort to obtain market participant assumptions, or independent evaluation.
The following tables set forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the Continuing Plan’s assets measured at fair value at

There have been no changes in the methodologies used in estimating the fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2024.  The money market fund approximates fair value due to its immediate maturity.
The preceding methods described may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.  Furthermore, although Trustmark believes their valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.
Contributions
The range of potential contributions to the Continuing Plan is determined annually by the Continuing Plan’s actuary in accordance with applicable IRS rules and regulations.  Trustmark’s policy is to fund amounts that are sufficient to satisfy the annual minimum funding requirements and do not exceed the maximum that is deductible for federal income tax purposes.  The actual amount of the contribution

127

is determined annually based on the Continuing Plan’s funded status and return on plan assets as of the measurement date, which is December 31.  For the plan year ending December 31, 2024
, Trustmark’s minimum required contribution to the Continuing Plan was $
127
 thousand and Trustmark contributed $
290
 thousand.  For the plan year ending December 31, 2025, Trustmark’s minimum required contribution to the Continuing Plan is expected to be $
109
 thousand.  Management and the Board of Directors of Trustmark will monitor the Continuing Plan throughout 2025 to determine any additional funding requirements by the plan’s measurement date.

Supplemental Retirement Plans
Trustmark maintains a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan covering key executive officers and senior officers as well as directors who have elected to defer fees.  The plan provides for retirement and/or death benefits based on a participant’s covered salary or deferred fees.  Although plan benefits may be paid from Trustmark’s general assets, Trustmark has purchased life insurance contracts on the participants covered under the plan, which may be used to fund future benefit payments under the plan.  The annual measurement date for the plan is December 31.  As a result of mergers prior to 2014, Trustmark became the administrator of nonqualified supplemental retirement plans, for which the plan benefits were frozen prior to the merger date.

Other Benefit Plans
Defined Contribution Plan
Trustmark provides associates with a self-directed 401(k) retirement plan that allows associates to contribute a percentage of eligible compensation, within limits provided by the Internal Revenue Code and accompanying regulations, into the plan. Trustmark matches 
100
% of associate contributions to the plan based on the amount of each participant’s contributions up to a maximum of 
6
% of eligible compensation, subject to the IRS maximum eligible compensation.  Associates are automatically enrolled in the plan at 
3
% of eligible compensation unless they opt out within 
60
 days of employment.  Associates may become eligible to make elective deferral contributions the first of the month following one month of employment. Eligible associates that elect to participate vest immediately in Trustmark’s matching contributions, as this is a Safe Harbor 401(k) Plan.  Trustmark’s contributions to this plan were $
10.7
 million in 
2024
, $
10.8
 million in 
2023
 and $
10.2
 million in 
2022
.

Note 16 – Stock and Incentive Compensation Plans
Trustmark has granted restricted stock units subject to the provisions of the Stock and Incentive Compensation Plan (the Stock Plan).  Current outstanding and future grants of restricted stock units are subject to the provisions of the Stock Plan, which is designed to provide flexibility to Trustmark regarding its ability to motivate, attract and retain the services of key associates and directors.  The Stock Plan also allows Trustmark to grant nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units to key associates and directors.  At December 31, 2024
, the maximum number of shares of Trustmark’s common stock available for issuance under the Stock Plan was 
849,968
 shares.
Restricted Stock Grants
Performance Units
Trustmark’s performance units vest over 
three years
 and are granted to Trustmark’s executive and senior management teams.  Performance units granted vest based on performance goals of return on average tangible equity and total shareholder return.  Performance units are valued utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate fair value of the units at the grant date.  The Monte Carlo simulation is performed by an independent valuation consultant and requires the use of subjective modeling assumptions.  These units are recognized using the straight-line method over the requisite service period.  These units 
are granted at 
100
% of target, yet
 provide for achievement units if performance measures exceed 
100
%.  The restricted stock agreement for these units provide for dividend privileges, but no voting rights.

Note 17 – Commitments and Contingencies
Lending Related
Trustmark makes commitments to extend credit and issues standby and commercial letters of credit (letters of credit) in the normal course of business in order to fulfill the financing needs of its customers.  The carrying amount of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit approximates the fair value of such financial instruments.
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend money to customers pursuant to certain specified conditions.  Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses.  Because many of these commitments are expected to expire without being fully drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  The exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the commitments to extend credit is represented by the contract amount of those instruments.  Trustmark applies the same credit policies and standards as it does in the lending process when making these

131

commitments.  The collateral obtained is based upon the nature of the transaction and the assessed creditworthiness of the borrower.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023
, Trustmark had unused commitments to extend credit of $
4.575
 billion and $
4.907
 billion, respectively.
Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by Trustmark to insure the performance of a customer to a third-party.  A financial standby letter of credit irrevocably obligates Trustmark to pay a third-party beneficiary when a customer fails to repay an outstanding loan or debt instrument.  A performance standby letter of credit irrevocably obligates Trustmark to pay a third-party beneficiary when a customer fails to perform some contractual, nonfinancial obligation.  When issuing letters of credit, Trustmark uses the same policies regarding credit risk and collateral, which are followed in the lending process.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023
, Trustmark’s maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party for letters of credit was $
110.4
 million and $
125.4
 million, respectively.  These amounts consist primarily of commitments with maturities of less than 
three years
, which have an immaterial carrying value.  Trustmark holds collateral to support standby letters of credit when deemed necessary.  At 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the fair value of collateral held was $
27.2
 million and $
31.4
 million, respectively.
ACL on Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures
Trustmark maintains a separate ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures, including unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit, which is included on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Changes in the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures were as follows for the periods presented ($ in thousands):

Years Ended December 31,

$

29,392

$

$

36,838

Adjustments to the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures are recorded to PCL, off-balance sheet credit exposures.  The decrease in the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily reflected a decrease in required reserves as a result of changes in the total reserve rate coupled with a decrease in unfunded commitments which was partially offset by an increase in required reserves as a result of implementing the Performance Trend and the External Factor-Credit Quality Review qualitative reserve factors.  The decrease in the ACL on off-balance sheet credit exposures for the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to decreases in unfunded commitments for the construction, land development and other land portfolio and other construction loan portfolio.
Legal Proceedings
Trustmark and its subsidiaries are parties to lawsuits and other claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Some of the lawsuits assert claims related to the lending, collection, servicing, investment, trust and other business activities, and some of the lawsuits allege substantial claims for damages.
In accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 450-20, “Loss Contingencies,” Trustmark will establish an accrued liability for any litigation matter if and when such matter presents loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable.  At the present time, Trustmark believes, based on its evaluation and the advice of legal counsel, that a loss in any currently pending legal proceeding is not probable and a reasonable estimate cannot reasonably be made.

Note 18 – Shareholders’ Equity
Regulatory Capital
Trustmark and TNB are subject to minimum risk-based capital and leverage capital requirements, as described in the section captioned “Capital Adequacy” included in Part I. Item 1. – Business of this report, which are administered by the federal bank regulatory agencies.  These capital requirements, as defined by federal regulations, involve quantitative and qualitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet instruments.  Trustmark’s and TNB’s minimum risk-based capital requirements include a capital conservation buffer of 
2.5
%.  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, is not included in computing regulatory capital.  Trustmark elected the five-year phase-in transition period (through December 31, 2024) related to adopting FASB ASU 2016-13 for regulatory capital purposes.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the financial statements of Trustmark and TNB and limit Trustmark’s and TNB’s ability to pay dividends.  At 
December 31, 2024, Trustmark and TNB exceeded all applicable minimum capital standards.  In addition, Trustmark and TNB met applicable regulatory guidelines to be considered well-capitalized at December 31,

132

2024.  To be categorized in this manner, Trustmark and TNB maintained minimum common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the accompanying table, and were not subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by their primary federal regulators to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measures.  There are no significant conditions or events that have occurred since December 31, 2024, which Management believes have affected Trustmark’s or TNB’s present classification.
The following table provides Trustmark’s and TNB’s actual regulatory capital amounts and ratios under regulatory capital standards in effect at

Note 19 – Fair Value
Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value
The methodologies Trustmark uses in determining the fair values are based primarily on the use of independent, market-based data to reflect a value that would be reasonably expected upon exchange of the position in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The predominant portion of assets that are stated at fair value are of a nature that can be valued using prices or inputs that are readily observable through a variety of independent data providers.  The providers selected by Trustmark for fair valuation data are widely recognized and accepted vendors whose evaluations support the pricing functions of financial institutions, investment and mutual funds, and portfolio managers.  Trustmark has documented and evaluated the pricing methodologies used by the vendors and maintains internal processes that regularly test valuations for anomalies.
Trustmark utilizes an independent pricing service to advise it on the carrying value of the securities available for sale portfolio.  As part of Trustmark’s procedures, the price provided from the service is evaluated for reasonableness given market changes.  When a questionable price exists, Trustmark investigates further to determine if the price is valid.  If needed, other market participants may be utilized to determine the correct fair value.  Trustmark has also reviewed and confirmed its determinations in thorough discussions with the pricing source regarding their methods of price discovery.
Mortgage loan commitments are valued based on the securities prices of similar collateral, term, rate and delivery for which the loan is eligible to deliver in place of the particular security.  Trustmark acquires a broad array of mortgage security prices that are supplied by a market data vendor, which in turn accumulates prices from a broad list of securities dealers.  Prices are processed through a mortgage pipeline management system that accumulates and segregates all loan commitment and forward-sale transactions according to the similarity of various characteristics (maturity, term, rate, and collateral).  Prices are matched to those positions that are deemed to be an eligible substitute or offset (
i.e.,
 “deliverable”) for a corresponding security observed in the marketplace.
Trustmark estimates fair value of the MSR through the use of prevailing market participant assumptions and market participant valuation processes.  This valuation is periodically tested and validated against other third-party firm valuations.
Trustmark obtains the fair value of interest rate swaps from a third-party pricing service that uses an industry standard discounted cash flow methodology.  In addition, credit valuation adjustments are incorporated in the fair values to account for potential nonperformance risk.  In adjusting the fair value of its interest rate swap contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, Trustmark has considered any applicable credit enhancements such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.  In conjunction with the FASB’s

136

fair value measurement guidance, Trustmark made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of these derivative financial instruments, which are subject to master netting agreements, on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.
Trustmark has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its interest rate swaps offered to qualified commercial borrowers fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, while the credit valuation adjustments associated with these derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads.  Trustmark has assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its interest rate swaps and has determined that the credit valuation adjustment is not significant to the overall valuation of these derivatives.  As a result, Trustmark classifies its interest rate swap valuations in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Trustmark also utilizes exchange-traded derivative instruments such as Treasury note futures contracts and option contracts to achieve a fair value return that offsets the changes in fair value of the MSR attributable to interest rates.  Fair values of these derivative instruments are determined from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets therefore allowing them to be classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  In addition, Trustmark utilizes derivative instruments such as interest rate lock commitments in its mortgage banking area which lack observable inputs for valuation purposes resulting in their inclusion in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
At this time, Trustmark presents no fair values that are derived through internal modeling.  Should positions requiring fair valuation arise that are not relevant to existing methodologies, Trustmark will make every reasonable effort to obtain market participant assumptions, or independent evaluation.
Financial Assets and Liabilities
The following tables summarize financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, segregated by the level of valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy utilized to measure fair value ($ in thousands).  There were no transfers between fair value levels for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Trustmark may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP.  Assets at December 31, 2024, which have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, include collateral-dependent LHFI.  A loan is collateral dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially through the sale of the collateral.  The expected credit loss for collateral-dependent loans is measured as the difference between the amortized cost basis of the loan and the fair value of the collateral, adjusted for the estimated cost to sell.  Fair value estimates for collateral-dependent loans are derived from appraised values based on the current market value or as is value of the collateral, normally from recently received and reviewed appraisals.  Current appraisals are ordered on an annual basis based on the inspection date or more often if market conditions necessitate.  Appraisals are obtained from state-certified appraisers and are based on certain assumptions, which may include construction or development status and the highest and best use of the property.  These appraisals are reviewed by Trustmark’s Appraisal Review Department to ensure they are acceptable, and values are adjusted down for costs associated with asset disposal.  At December 31, 2024
, Trustmark had outstanding balances of $
37.1
 million with a related ACL of $
13.7
 million in collateral-dependent LHFI, compared to outstanding balances of $
49.1
 million with a related ACL of $
12.4
 million in collateral-dependent LHFI at 
December 31, 2023.  The collateral-dependent LHFI are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities
Certain nonfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include foreclosed assets (upon initial recognition or subsequent impairment), nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities measured at fair value in the second step of a goodwill impairment test, and intangible assets and other nonfinancial long-lived assets measured at fair value for impairment assessment.
Other real estate includes assets that have been acquired in satisfaction of debt through foreclosure and is recorded at the fair value less cost to sell (estimated fair value) at the time of foreclosure.  Fair value is based on independent appraisals and other relevant factors.  In the determination of fair value subsequent to foreclosure, Management also considers other factors or recent developments, such as changes in market conditions from the time of valuation and anticipated sales values considering plans for disposition, which could result in an adjustment to lower the collateral value estimates indicated in the appraisals.  Periodic revaluations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy since assumptions are used that may not be observable in the market.
Foreclosed assets of $
5.5
 million were re-measured during 
2024
, requiring write-downs of $
2.2
 million to reach their current fair values compared to $
898
 thousand of foreclosed assets that were re-measured during 
2023
, requiring write-downs of $
243
 thousand.

Fair Value Option
Trustmark has elected to account for its LHFS under the fair value option, with interest income on these LHFS reported in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI.  The fair value of the LHFS is determined using quoted prices for a similar asset, adjusted for specific attributes of that loan.  The LHFS are actively managed and monitored and certain market risks of the loans may be mitigated through the use of derivatives.  These derivative instruments are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as noninterest income in mortgage banking, net.  The changes in the fair value of the LHFS are largely offset by changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments.  For the year ended December 31, 2024
, a net loss of $
2.1
 million was recorded as noninterest income in mortgage banking, net for changes in the fair value of the LHFS accounted for under the fair value option compared to net gain of $
2.2
 million and a net loss of $
3.3
 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 
2023 and 2022.  Interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI for the year ended December 31, 2024
 included $
8.6
 million of interest earned on the LHFS accounted for under the fair value option compared to $
7.8
 million and $
6.8
 million for the years ended December 31, 
2023 and 2022
, respectively.  Election of the fair value option allows Trustmark to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at the lower of cost or fair value and the derivatives at fair value.   The fair value option election does not apply to the GNMA optional repurchase loans which do not meet the requirements under FASB ASC Topic 825 to be accounted for under the fair value option.  GNMA optional repurchase loans totaled $
97.6
 million and $
78.8
 million at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are included in LHFS on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Note 20 – Derivative Financial Instruments
Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments
Trustmark engages in a cash flow hedging program to add stability to interest income and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements.  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for Trustmark making variable-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional

139

amount.  Interest rate floor spreads designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts if interest rates fall below the purchased floor strike rate on the contract and payments of variable-rate amounts if interest rates fall below the sold floor strike rate on the contract.  Trustmark uses such derivatives to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing and anticipated variable-rate loan assets.  At December 31, 2024
, the aggregate notional value of Trustmark's interest rate swaps and floor spreads designated as cash flow hedges totaled $
1.500
 billion compared to $
1.125
 billion at 
December 31, 2023.
Trustmark records any gains or losses on these cash flow hedges in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  Gains and losses on derivatives representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized over the life of the hedge on a systematic and rational basis, as documented at hedge inception in accordance with Trustmark’s accounting policy election.  The earnings recognition of excluded components included in interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI totaled $
474
 thousand and $
57
 thousand of amortization expense for the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively.  As interest payments are received on Trustmark's variable-rate assets, amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified into interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI in the accompanying consolidated statements of income during the same period.  During the next twelve months, Trustmark estimates that $
8.1
 million will be reclassified as a reduction to interest and fees on LHFS and LHFI.  This amount could differ due to changes in interest rates, hedge de-designations or the addition of other hedges.
Derivatives not Designated as Hedging Instruments
Trustmark utilizes a portfolio of exchange-traded derivative instruments, such as Treasury note futures contracts and option contracts, to achieve a fair value return that economically hedges changes in the fair value of the MSR attributable to interest rates.  These transactions are considered freestanding derivatives that do not otherwise qualify for hedge accounting.  The total notional amount of these derivative instruments was $
311.5
 million at 
December 31, 2024
 compared to $
285.0
 million at 
December 31, 2023
.  Changes in the fair value of these exchange-traded derivative instruments are recorded as noninterest income in mortgage banking, net and are offset by changes in the fair value of the MSR.  The impact of this strategy resulted in a net negative ineffectiveness of $
9.2
 million, $
6.3
 million and $
4.1
 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
As part of Trustmark’s risk management strategy in the mortgage banking area, derivative instruments such as forward sales contracts are utilized.  Trustmark’s obligations under forward sales contracts consist of commitments to deliver mortgage loans, originated and/or purchased, in the secondary market at a future date.  Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded as noninterest income in mortgage banking, net and are offset by changes in the fair value of LHFS.  Trustmark’s off-balance sheet obligations under these derivative instruments totaled $
110.0
 million at 
December 31, 2024
, with a positive valuation adjustment of $
679
 thousand, compared to $
109.5
 million at 
December 31, 2023
, with a negative valuation adjustment of $
994
 thousand.
Trustmark also utilizes derivative instruments such as interest rate lock commitments in its mortgage banking area.  Interest rate lock commitments are residential mortgage loan commitments with customers, which guarantee a specified interest rate for a specified time period.  Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded as noninterest income in mortgage banking, net and are offset by the changes in the fair value of forward sales contracts.  Trustmark’s off-balance sheet obligations under these derivative instruments totaled $
52.1
 million at 
December 31, 2024
, with a positive valuation adjustment of $
229
 thousand, compared to $
61.9
 million at 
December 31, 2023
, with a positive valuation adjustment of $
845
 thousand.
Trustmark offers certain derivatives products directly to qualified commercial lending clients seeking to manage their interest rate risk.  Trustmark economically hedges interest rate swap transactions executed with commercial lending clients by entering into offsetting interest rate swap transactions with institutional derivatives market participants.  Derivatives transactions executed as part of this program are not designated as qualifying hedging relationships and are, therefore, carried at fair value with the change in fair value recorded as noninterest income in bank card and other fees.  Because these derivatives have mirror-image contractual terms, in addition to collateral provisions which mitigate the impact of non-performance risk, the changes in fair value are expected to substantially offset.  The offsetting interest rate swap transactions are either cleared through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for clearable transactions or booked directly with institutional derivatives market participants for non-clearable transactions.  The Chicago Mercantile Exchange rules legally characterize variation margin collateral payments made or received for centrally cleared interest rate swaps as settlements rather than collateral.  As a result, centrally cleared interest rate swaps included in other assets and other liabilities are presented on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  At December 31, 2024
, Trustmark had interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $
1.819
 billion related to this program, compared to $
1.500
 billion at 
December 31, 2023.
Credit-risk-related Contingent Features
Trustmark has agreements with its financial institution counterparties that contain provisions where if Trustmark defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then Trustmark could also be declared in default on its derivatives obligations.

140

At December 31, 2024
, the termination value of interest rate swaps in a liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements was $
568
 thousand compared to $
1.4
 million at 
December 31, 2023.  At December 31, 2024 and 2023
, Trustmark had posted collateral of $
1.5
 million and $
2.0
 million, respectively, against its obligations because of negotiated thresholds and minimum transfer amounts under these agreements.  If Trustmark had breached any of these triggering provisions at 
December 31, 2024, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value.
Credit risk participation agreements arise when Trustmark contracts with other financial institutions, as a guarantor or beneficiary, to share credit risk associated with certain interest rate swaps.  These agreements provide for reimbursement of losses resulting from a third-party default on the underlying swap.  At December 31, 2024
, Trustmark had entered into 
eleven
 risk participation agreements as a beneficiary with an aggregate notional amount of $
83.9
 million compared to 
six
 risk participation agreements as a beneficiary with an aggregate notional amount of $
40.1
 million at 
December 31, 2023.  At December 31, 2024
, Trustmark had entered into 
twenty-eight
 risk participation agreements as a guarantor with aggregate notional amounts of $
229.1
 million compared to 
thirty-five
 risk participation agreements as a guarantor with aggregate notional amounts of $
304.7
 million at 
December 31, 2023.  The aggregate fair values of these risk participation agreements were immaterial at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Note 21 – Segment Information
Trustmark’s management reporting structure includes 
two
 segments: General Banking and Wealth Management.  The General Banking Segment is responsible for all traditional banking products and services, including loans and deposits.  The General Banking Segment also consists of internal operations such as Human Resources, Executive Administration, Treasury (Funds Management), Public Affairs and Corporate Finance.  The Wealth Management Segment provides customized solutions for customers by integrating financial services with traditional banking products and services such as money management, full-service brokerage, financial planning, personal and institutional trust and retirement services.  Trustmark's reportable segments are determined by the 
Chief Executive Officer
 (CEO), who is the designated chief operating decision maker (CODM), based upon information provided about Trustmark's products and services offered.  The reportable segments are also distinguished by the level of information provided to the CEO, who uses such information to review performance of various lines of business, which are then aggregated if operating performance, products and services and customers are similar.  
The 
CEO evaluates the financial performance of Trustmark's lines of business, such as evaluating revenue 

142

streams, 
significant expenses and budget to actual results, in assessing the performance of Trustmark's reportable segments and in the determination of allocating resources.

The Insurance Segment is included in discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of income. See Note 2 - Discontinued Operations for additional information about discontinued operations.
The accounting policies of each reportable segment are the same as those of Trustmark except for its internal allocations.  Noninterest expenses for back-office operations support are allocated to segments based on estimated uses of those services.  Trustmark measures the net interest income of its business segments with a process that assigns cost of funds or earnings credit on a matched-term basis.  This process, called “funds transfer pricing”, charges an appropriate cost of funds to assets held by a business unit, or credits the business unit for potential earnings for carrying liabilities.  The net of these charges and credits flows through to the General Banking Segment, which contains the management team responsible for determining TNB’s funding and interest rate risk strategies.
The following tables disclose financial information by reportable segment for the periods presented ($ in thousands):

There has been no change of accountants within the two-year period prior to December 31, 2024.

ITEM 9A. CONTROL
S AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried out by Trustmark’s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Treasurer and Principal Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of Trustmark’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.  No changes were made to Trustmark’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Trustmark’s internal control over financial reporting.

Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of Trustmark is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Trustmark’s internal control over financial reporting was designed under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Treasurer (Principal Financial Officer) to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of published financial statements in accordance with GAAP.

Management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.  In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
.  Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2024, Trustmark’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

The effectiveness of Trustmark’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024
 was audited by 
Crowe LLP
, 
Fort Lauderdale, Florida
, (U.S. PCAOB Auditor Firm I.D.: 
173
