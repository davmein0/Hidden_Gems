ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Business Overview

Crocs, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) are engaged in the design, development, worldwide marketing, distribution, and sale of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for all. We strive to be the world leader in innovative casual footwear for all, combining comfort and style with a value that consumers want. The vast majority of shoes within the Crocs Brand’s collection contain Croslite™ material, a proprietary, molded footwear technology, delivering extraordinary comfort with each step. The HEYDUDE Brand provides an innovative loafer concept that is differentiated through easy on and off, quality, and comfort. The broad appeal of our footwear has allowed us to market our products through a wide range of distribution channels. We currently sell our products in more than 80 countries, through two distribution channels: wholesale and direct-to-consumer. Our wholesale channel includes domestic and international multi-brand retailers, mono-branded partner stores, e-tailers, and distributors; our direct-to-consumer channel includes company-operated retail stores, company-operated e-commerce sites, and third-party marketplaces.
Known or Anticipated Trends
Based on our recent operating results and our assessment of the current operating environment, we anticipate certain trends will continue to impact our future operating results:
•
We continue to operate in an environment where consumers are feeling the effects of elevated interest rates and inflation, and as a result, they are spending more cautiously. In addition, geopolitical tensions have increased across the globe. In February 2025, the U.S. presidential administration has also imposed tariffs on foreign imports into the United States, including, most relevant to us, an additional 10% tariff on all imports from China and an additional 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico, which tariffs on imports from Mexico were subsequently suspended in order to facilitate negotiations. As of the date of this Annual Report, the proposed tariffs on all imports from Mexico remain suspended. We remain focused on making the right decisions for the health of our brands, maintaining tight inventory control, and investing in strategic initiatives to support durable long-term growth.
•
In 2025, we plan to continue to invest in talent, marketing, digital, and retail to drive our strategic pillars, including awareness and relevance for our brands and iconic product, increased market share in our core markets, and product diversification into sandals, sneakers, and other key silhouettes. We will also remain focused on launching and scaling digital marketplaces and selectively adding retail stores for both brands.
•
Our liquidity position remains strong with approximately $180.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $824 million in available borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2024. Our total borrowings were $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2024. We repurchased $551.2 million of our common stock during the year.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), we present certain information related to our current period results of operations through “constant currency,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed as a supplement to our results of operations and presentation of reportable segments under U.S. GAAP. Constant currency represents current period results that have been retranslated using prior year average foreign exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on reported amounts.
Management uses constant currency to assist in comparing business trends from period to period on a consistent basis in communications with the Board, stockholders, analysts, and investors concerning our financial performance. We believe constant currency is useful to investors and other users of our consolidated financial statements as an additional tool to evaluate operating performance and trends. Investors should not consider constant currency in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Key Performance Indicators
Management utilizes the key performance metrics of gross margin, operating margin, footwear unit sales, and average footwear selling price to gauge the Company’s operational efficiency and market competitiveness, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. Management continuously monitors and analyzes these metrics in an effort to ensure we  remain agile, competitive, and aligned with our long-term growth objectives. The titles and/or definitions of certain of these 
33
Table of Contents
metrics may vary from company to company. As a result, our calculation of certain of these metrics may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics used by other companies.
Gross Margin
Gross margin is defined as gross profit divided by revenues. Management uses this metric and believes it is useful for investors because it provides insights into profitability, cost management, and pricing strategy.
Operating Margin
Operating margin is defined as income from operations divided by revenues. Management uses this metric and believes it is useful for investors because it provides a comprehensive view of profitability from its core business operations, excluding the effects of financing and tax considerations.
Footwear Unit Sales
Footwear unit sales is defined as wholesale and DTC footwear only sales. Management uses this metric and believes it is useful for investors because it provides a direct measure of our sales volume and can offer valuable insights into its market performance and growth potential.
Average Footwear Selling Price
Average footwear selling price is defined as footwear and footwear accessories revenues divided by footwear units. Management uses this metric and believes it is useful for investors because it provides insights into our pricing strategy, market positioning, and revenue generation capabilities.
Direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) Comparable Sales
DTC comparable sales include revenues from stores and e-commerce sites that have been in operation for more than twelve months, as defined further below. Management uses this metric to evaluate the performance of our stores and e-commerce platforms on a consistent basis.
2024 Financial and Operational Highlights
Revenues were $4,102.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a 3.5% increase compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was due to the net effects of: (i) higher average selling price on a constant currency basis (“ASP”) in both brands, which increased revenues by $156.2 million, or 3.9%; (ii) higher unit sales volume, which resulted in an increase in revenues of $13.7 million, or 0.3%; and (iii) net unfavorable changes in exchange rates, which decreased revenues by $30.1 million, or 0.8%.
The following were significant developments affecting our businesses during the year ended December 31, 2024:
•
We grew Crocs Brand revenues 8.8% compared to the same period in 2023. HEYDUDE Brand revenues decreased 13.2%.
•
Gross margin was 58.8% compared to 55.8% in 2023, an increase of 300 basis points. This was primarily due to prior year distribution costs associated with the move to our new HEYDUDE distribution center in Las Vegas, Nevada that did not recur in the current year, higher ASP, favorable customer mix, and favorable brand mix.
•
Selling, general & administrative expenses (“SG&A”) were $1,388.3 million compared to $1,173.2 million 2023, primarily as a result of higher variable expenses related to higher revenues in the DTC channel and continued investment in talent and marketing. As a percent of revenues, SG&A increased to 33.8% of revenues compared to 29.6% in 2023.
•
Income from operations was $1,021.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to income from operations of $1,036.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net income was $950.1 million, or $15.88 per diluted share, compared to $792.6 million, or $12.79 per diluted share, in 2023.

Revenues.
 In the year ended December 31, 2024, revenues increased $139.8 million, or 3.5%, compared to 2023. Higher average selling price on a constant currency basis (“ASP”) increased revenues by $156.2 million, or 3.9%, primarily due to higher ASP in both brands, driven mostly by net price increases, favorable channel mix, and favorable product mix. Higher volume of $13.7 million, or 0.3%, primarily due to higher volume in the Crocs Brand, partially offset by lower volume in the HEYDUDE Brand, also increased revenues. Net unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, primarily in the South Korean Won, Brazilian Real, Japanese Yen, and Chinese Yuan decreased revenues by $30.1 million, or 0.8%.
Gross margin.
 Gross margin was 58.8% compared to 55.8% in 2023. This was primarily driven by the absence of prior year distribution costs of approximately 70 basis points, primarily associated with the move to our new HEYDUDE distribution center in Las Vegas, Nevada that did not recur in the current year, higher ASP, as described above, of 50 basis points, favorable customer mix of 50 basis points, and favorable brand mix of 50 basis points.
In the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, cost of sales included $487.1 million and $515.3 million, respectively, of distribution expenses primarily related to receiving, inspecting, warehousing, and packaging product in owned and third-party warehouses, combined with transportation costs associated with delivering products from distribution centers to wholesale partners, retail stores, and end customers.
Selling, general and administrative expenses.
 SG&A as a percent of revenue increased to 33.8% during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023, as SG&A expenses increased $215.1 million, or 18.3%, largely driven by higher variable expenses related to higher revenues in the DTC channel of $84.7 million. There were also higher compensation costs of $62.0 million, primarily associated with an investment in talent, and higher marketing costs of $37.1 million. Additionally, there was an increase in impairment charges of $14.8 million due to current year impairments of information technology systems related to the HEYDUDE integration, our former HEYDUDE warehouse in Las Vegas, Nevada, and our former Crocs Brand warehouse in Oudenbosch, the Netherlands, partially offset by a prior year impairment related to the right-of-use asset and leasehold improvement assets for our former headquarters which did not recur in the current year. An increase in information technology costs of $6.9 million and net increases in other costs, including an increase in professional services and facilities costs, of $9.6 million, also contributed to the overall increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.
Foreign currency gains (losses), net. 
Foreign currency gains (losses), net, consists of unrealized and realized foreign currency gains and losses from the remeasurement and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses on certain foreign currency derivative instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized realized and unrealized net foreign currency losses of $6.8 million compared to losses of $1.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2023.
Interest expense. 
Interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased $52.1 million, or 32.3%, primarily due to lower outstanding borrowings and lower weighted average interest rates on the Term Loan B Facility (as defined herein) in the current year.
36
Table of Contents
Income tax expense (benefit). 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized an income tax benefit of $39.5 million on pre-tax book income of $910.6 million, representing an effective tax rate of (4.3)%, compared to an income tax expense of $83.7 million on pre-tax book income of $876.3 million in 2023, which represented an effective tax rate of 9.6%. The current year effective tax rate is lower primarily due to the current year foreign net income tax benefit as a result of an intra-entity transaction related to certain intellectual property rights, offset by the increase of valuation allowances. Our effective tax rate has varied dramatically in recent years due to intra-entity intellectual property rights transactions, differences in our profitability levels and relative operating earnings across multiple jurisdictions, and by changes in the valuation allowance.
During the three months ended December 31, 2024, we completed an intra-entity transaction related to certain intellectual property rights primarily to align with current and future international operations. The transaction resulted in a step-up in tax basis of intellectual property rights and a correlated increase in foreign deferred tax assets based on the fair value of the intellectual property rights. Foreign deferred tax assets increased by $268.8 million and this benefit was offset by an increase in uncertain tax positions of $145.6 million. As such, a net change in deferred tax asset of $123.2 million was recognized along with a corresponding foreign income tax benefit. In 2024, we received new information and remeasured the reserve for uncertain tax positions related to the 2020 and 2021 intellectual property rights transactions which resulted in the release of uncertain tax positions of $141.2 million along with a corresponding foreign income tax benefit. 
Our valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization of tax attributes recorded in various jurisdictions. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have evaluated the realizability of our deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income, including the reversal of existing temporary differences, historical and projected operating results and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In assessing our valuation allowance as of December 31, 2024, we considered all available evidence, including the magnitude of recent and current operating results, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our historical experience utilizing tax attributes prior to their expiration dates, the historical volatility of operating results of these jurisdictions and our assessment regarding the sustainability of their profitability. The weight we give to any particular item is, in part, dependent upon the degree to which it can be objectively verified. Valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets increased by a net $58.0 million. 
The 2024 impact of changes in valuation allowances to the effective tax rate was an unfavorable impact of $58.9 million
, 
equating to a 6.5% unfavorable impact. 
There is also a $0.9 million favorable change in the valuation allowance related to cumulative translation adjustments. We maintain valuation allowances of approximately $241.6 million as of December 31, 2024, which may be reduced in the future depending upon the achieved profitability of certain jurisdictions as well as the magnitude of the profitability.

  In the first quarter of 2024, to reflect a change in the way management evaluates segment performance, makes operating decisions, and allocates resources, we made changes to segment profitability related to certain foreign currency amounts impacting cost of sales. These amounts have shifted costs or benefits that were previously presented in each of our reportable segments to ‘Enterprise corporate.’ We believe that the impact of these changes on prior periods is insignificant to each segment and thus have not recast prior periods.
Crocs Brand
Revenues.
 The Crocs Brand segment grew revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023 due to higher volume, primarily in the DTC channel, and higher ASP, mostly due to favorable channel mix, price increases in certain international markets, and favorable product mix. The overall increase in revenues was partially offset by net unfavorable currency fluctuations driven by the South Korean Won, Brazilian Real, Japanese Yen, and Chinese Yuan.
Income from Operations.
 During the year ended December 31, 2024, income from operations for our Crocs Brand segment was $1,182.0 million, an increase of $102.7 million, or 9.5% from 2023. Gross margin was 61.6% for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of 160 basis points compared to 2023. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to lower freight and fulfillment costs and favorable product mix.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, SG&A for our Crocs Brand segment increased by $109.3 million, or 15.0%, compared to 2023, primarily due to increases in marketing costs, variable expenses related to higher revenues in the DTC channel, and depreciation and amortization expense.
HEYDUDE Brand
Revenues. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, HEYDUDE revenues decreased compared to 2023, due to lower volume. Higher ASP was driven by less discounting in the current year and favorable channel mix, partially offset by unfavorable product mix.
Income from Operations. 
For the HEYDUDE Brand, income from operations during the year ended December 31, 2024 was $137.4 million, a decrease of $75.0 million, or 35.3%, compared to 2023. Gross margin was 47.7% for the year ended 
38
Table of Contents
December 31, 2024, an increase of 370 basis points. The increase in gross margin is largely due to higher ASP, as described above, favorable channel mix, and lower freight costs. Additionally, there were prior year distribution costs associated with the move to our new HEYDUDE distribution center in Las Vegas, Nevada that did not recur in the current year, offset in part by transition costs and infrastructure investments incurred in the current year associated with the move.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, SG&A for the HEYDUDE Brand segment increased by $50.3 million, or 24.4%, primarily due to increases in marketing costs, compensation costs, and facilities costs, all of which partially relate to investments in our DTC channel. Impairment costs of the right-of-use assets for our former HEYDUDE Brand warehouses in Las Vegas, Nevada in the current year also contributed to the increase in SG&A.
Enterprise Corporate
During the year ended December 31, 2024, total net costs within ‘Enterprise corporate’ increased $42.6 million, or 16.7%, compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in compensation costs. An increase in impairment charges due to a current year information technology systems impairment of $18.2 million, partially offset by a prior year impairment of $9.3 million related to the right-of-use asset and leasehold improvement assets for our former corporate headquarters which did not recur in the current year, also increased costs. Additionally, depreciation and amortization expense and information technology costs increased.
Store Locations and Digital Sales Percentage
As of December 31, 2024, we had 390 company-operated retail locations for the Crocs Brand, inclusive of 184 retail locations in North America and 206 retail locations internationally.

Comparable store status, as included in the DTC comparable sales figures above, is determined on a monthly basis. Comparable store sales include the revenues of stores that have been in operation for more than twelve months. Stores in which selling square footage has changed more than 15% as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded until the thirteenth month in which they have comparable prior year sales. Temporarily closed stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation during the month of closure and in the same month in the following year. Location closures in excess of three months are excluded until the thirteenth month post re-opening. E-commerce comparable revenues are based on same site sales period over period. E-commerce sites that are temporarily offline or unable to transact or fulfill orders (“site disruption”) are excluded from the comparable sales calculation during the month of site disruption and in the same month in the following year. E-commerce site disruptions in excess of three months are excluded until the thirteenth month after the site has re-opened. Additionally, comparable sales do not include leap days in leap years.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our liquidity position as of December 31, 2024 was:
December 31, 2024
(in thousands)
Cash and cash equivalents
$
180,485 
Available borrowings
824,416 
As of December 31, 2024, we had $180.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and up to $824.4 million of available borrowings, including $809.4 million remaining borrowing availability under the Revolving Facility (as defined below) and $15.0 million of remaining borrowing availability under the Citibank Facility (as defined below). As of December 31, 2024, the Term Loan B Facility (as defined below) was fully drawn, and there was no available borrowing capacity. We believe that our cash flows from operations, our cash and cash equivalents on hand, and available borrowings under our Revolving Facility and Citibank Facility will be sufficient to meet our ongoing liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. 
Additional future financing may be necessary to fund our operations and there can be no assurance that, if needed, we will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity over the long term, the success of our operations, the global economic outlook, and the pace of sustainable growth in our markets could each impact our business and liquidity.
Repatriation of Cash

As a global business, we have cash balances in various countries and amounts are denominated in various currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our results of operations and cash positions. Future fluctuations in foreign currencies may have a material impact on our cash flows and capital resources. Cash balances held in foreign countries may have additional restrictions and covenants associated with them which could adversely impact our liquidity and our ability to timely access and transfer cash balances between entities.
All of the cash held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. as of December 31, 2024 without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. In some countries, repatriation of certain foreign balances is restricted by local laws. These limitations may affect our ability to fully utilize our cash resources for needs in the U.S. or other countries and could adversely affect our liquidity. As of December 31, 2024, 
we held $108.0 million of our total $180.5 million in cash in internationa
l locations. This cash is primarily used for the ongoing operations of the business in the locations in which the cash is held. Of 
the $108.0 million, an insignificant amount could potentially be restricted by local laws.
Senior Revolving Credit Facility
In July 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (the “Borrowers”) entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”), with the lenders named therein and PNC Bank, National Association, as a lender and administrative agent for the lenders. Since that time, we have amended the Credit Agreement, which, as amended to date, provides for a revolving credit facility of $1.0 billion, which can be increased by an additional $400.0 million, subject to certain conditions (the “Revolving Facility”). Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable interest rate based on (A) a Base Rate (defined as the highest of (i) the Overnight Bank Funding Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus 0.25%, (ii) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and (iii) the Daily Simple SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus 1.00%), plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.25% to 0.875% based on our leverage ratio or 1.35% to 1.975% for the Daily Simple SOFR based on the leverage ratio, inclusive of a 0.10% SOFR adjustment, or (B) the Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.35% to 1.975% based on our leverage ratio for one-month interest periods and three-month interest periods, inclusive of a 0.10% SOFR adjustment. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by all of the assets of the Borrowers and guaranteed by certain other subsidiaries of the Borrowers.
The Credit Agreement required or requires, as applicable, us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio of (i) 4.00 to 1.00 from the quarter ended March 31, 2022 through, and including, the quarter ended December 31, 2023, (ii) 3.75 to 1.00 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, (iii) 3.50 to 1.00 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and (iv) 3.25 to 1.00 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and thereafter (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances). The Credit Agreement permits, among other things, (i) stock repurchases subject to certain restrictions, 
40
Table of Contents
including after giving effect to such stock repurchases, the maximum leverage ratio does not exceed certain levels; and (ii) certain acquisitions so long as there is borrowing availability under the Credit Agreement of at least $40.0 million. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.
As of December 31, 2024, the total commitments available from the lenders under the Revolving Facility were $1.0 billion. At December 31, 2024, we had $190.0 million in outstanding borrowings and $0.6 million in outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Facility, which reduces amounts available for borrowing under the Revolving Facility. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $809.4 million and $558.7 million, respectively, of available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility, which matures in November 2027.
Term Loan B Facility
On February 17, 2022, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Original Term Loan B Credit Agreement”) with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent and lender, to among other things, finance a portion of the cash consideration for the Acquisition, which was amended on August 8, 2023 (the “August 2023 Amendment”) and on February 13, 2024 (the “February 2024 Amendment”). The Original Term Loan B Credit Agreement, as amended by the August 2023 Amendment and the February 2024 Amendment is referred to herein as the “Term Loan B Credit Agreement”.
The Original Term Loan B Credit Agreement provided for an aggregate term loan B facility in the principal amount of $2.0 billion. Prior to the February 2024 Amendment, the outstanding balance was $820.0 million. Among other things, the February 2024 Amendment provided for a new $820.0 million tranche of term loans (the “2024 Refinancing Term Loans” and, such facility, the “Term Loan B Facility”), to refinance the then-outstanding principal balance. The 2024 Refinancing Term Loans are secured by substantially all of the Company’s and each subsidiary guarantor’s assets on a pari passu basis with their obligations arising from the Term Loan B Credit Agreement and is scheduled to mature on February 17, 2029, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Term Loan B Credit Agreement. Additionally, subject to certain conditions, including, without limitation, satisfying certain leverage ratios, the Company may, at any time, on one or more occasions, add one or more new classes of term facilities and/or increase the principal amount of the loans of any existing class by requesting one or more incremental term facilities
Pursuant to the reduced interest rate margins applicable to the 2024 Refinancing Term Loans, each term loan borrowing which is an alternate base rate borrowing bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Term Loan B Credit Agreement), plus 1.25%. Each term loan borrowing which is a term SOFR borrowing bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Term Loan B Credit Agreement) plus 2.25%.
As of December 31, 2024, the Term Loan B Facility was fully drawn with no remaining borrowing capacity, and we had $500.0 million in outstanding principal on the Term Loan B Facility, which matures on February 17, 2029.
The Term Loan B Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, incurrence financial covenants, representations and warranties, events of default and other provisions. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Term Loan B Credit Agreement.
Asia Revolving Credit Facility
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we had one revolving credit facility in Asia with Citibank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch (the “Citibank Facility”), which, as amended, provides up to an equivalent of $15.0 million.
As of December 31, 2024, we had no borrowings outstanding on the Citibank Facility. As of December 31, 2023, we had borrowings outstanding of $3.3 million on the Citibank Facility.
Senior Notes Issuances
In March 2021, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.250% Senior Notes due March 15, 2029 (the “2029 Notes”), pursuant to the indenture related thereto (as amended and/or supplemented to date, the “2029 Notes Indenture”). Additionally, in August 2021, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% Senior Notes due August 15, 2031 (the “2031 Notes”), pursuant to the indenture related thereto (as amended and/or supplemented to date, “the 2031 Notes Indenture” and, together with the 2029 Notes Indenture, the “Indentures” and, each, an “Indenture”). Interest on each of the 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes (collectively, the “Notes”) is payable semi-annually.

Table of Contents
The Company had or will have, as applicable, the option to redeem all or any portion of the 2029 Notes, at once or over time, at any time on or after March 15, 2024, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a premium declining ratably on an annual basis to par and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The Company also had the option to redeem some or all of the 2029 Notes at any time before March 15, 2024 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus a “make-whole” premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, at any time before March 15, 2024, the Company could have redeemed up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes at a redemption price of 104.250% of the principal amount with the proceeds from certain equity issuances, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. 
The Company will have the option to redeem all or any portion of the 2031 Notes, at once or over time, at any time on or after August 15, 2026, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus a premium declining ratably on an annual basis to par and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The Company will also have the option to redeem some or all of the 2031 Notes at any time before August 15, 2026 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus a “make-whole” premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, at any time before August 15, 2024, the Company could have redeemed up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2031 Notes at a redemption price of 104.125% of the principal amount with the proceeds from certain equity issuances, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.
The Notes rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior debt, including the Credit Agreement, and are senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s future debt that is, by its term, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by each of the Company’s restricted subsidiaries that is a borrower or guarantor under the Credit Agreement and by each of the Company’s wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries that guarantees any debt of the Company or any guarantor under any syndicated credit facility or capital markets debt in an aggregate principal amount in excess of $25.0 million.
The Indentures contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; pay dividends or repurchase or redeem capital stock or make other restricted payments; declare or pay dividends or other payments; incur liens; enter into certain types of transactions with the Company’s affiliates; and consolidate or merge with or into other companies. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Notes.

Operating Activities. 
Our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operating activities, consisting of net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in working capital. Cash provided by operating activities increased $62.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by higher net income, adjusted for non-cash items, of $360.1 million, partially offset by decreases in operating assets and liabilities of $298.1 million, primarily due to the change in income taxes and inventories.
Investing Activities. 
There was a $46.3 million decrease in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. This was due to a decrease in purchases of property, equipment, and software, primarily as a result of prior year purchases related to the expansion of our distribution centers and headquarters in North America in the year ended December 31, 2023, that did not recur in the current year.
Financing Activities.
 Cash used in financing activities increased by $26.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in cash used in financing activities was due to a decrease in 
42
Table of Contents
proceeds from borrowings of $155.7 million, an increase of $377.4 million in repurchases of common stock, including excise tax, and an increase of $0.5 million in deferred debt issuance costs. The overall increase in cash used in financing activities was offset by a decrease in repayments of borrowings of $498.3 million, a decrease of $8.8 million in repurchases of common stock for tax withholding, and other decreases in cash used of $0.1 million.
Stock Repurchases
On April 23, 2021, the Board approved and authorized a program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock. Additionally, on September 23, 2021, the Board approved an increase of $1.0 billion to our share repurchase authorization. The number, price, structure, and timing of the repurchases are at our sole discretion and may be made depending on market conditions, liquidity needs, restrictions under the agreements governing our indebtedness, and other factors. The Board of Directors may suspend, modify, or terminate the program at any time without prior notice. Share repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and does not obligate us to acquire any amount of our common stock. Under Delaware state law, these shares are not retired, and we have the right to resell any of the shares repurchased.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased 4.3 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $551.2 million, including commissions. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased 1.7 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $175.0 million, including commissions.
As of December 31, 2024, we had remaining authorization to repurchase approximately $323.9 million of our common stock, subject to restrictions under our Indentures, Credit Agreement, and Term Loan B Credit Agreement. On February 10, 2025, the Board approved a $1.0 billion increase to our share repurchase authorization, after which approximately $1.3 billion remained available for future common stock repurchases.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
General
Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, outside of discussions regarding constant currency, is based on the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis.
An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Our estimates are often based on historical experience, complex judgments, assessments of probability, and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. We believe that the following discussion represents those accounting policies that are the most critical to the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 — Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.

Impairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets
Our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of the HEYDUDE trademark, are not amortized. We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually or when an interim triggering event has occurred indicating potential impairment. Our annual test is performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter. Our impairment evaluations represent a critical accounting policy as they require significant judgments and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable.
We perform our goodwill impairment testing for each reporting unit that has goodwill. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 we had two reporting units, comprised of a reporting unit within the HEYDUDE Brand segment and a reporting unit within the Crocs Brand segment. We perform our indefinite-lived intangible impairment testing at the asset level.
When performing our annual test for impairment, we may assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. The qualitative assessment may evaluate factors such as macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, and overall financial performance, among other factors. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed. For the quantitative assessment, we compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit. If carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded. 
For the year ended December 31, 2024, we performed a quantitative assessment for the HEYDUDE Brand reporting unit goodwill and the HEYDUDE Brand indefinite-lived intangible assets. Both quantitative assessments were performed with the assistance of third-party valuation specialists. We performed the quantitative assessment for the HEYDUDE Brand reporting unit goodwill using the discounted cash flow method. For the impairment testing of the indefinite-lived trademark, we used the Multi-Period Excess Earnings approach. The primary assumptions developed by management and used in the quantitative assessments of the HEYDUDE Brand reporting unit and indefinite-lived trademark included future revenue growth rates, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”), and market-based discount rates. The estimated fair values of the HEYDUDE Brand reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark exceeded their carrying values.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, we performed a qualitative and quantitative assessment for the HEYDUDE Brand reporting unit goodwill, and we performed a quantitative assessment for the HEYDUDE Brand indefinite-lived intangible assets, each of which indicated the estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values.

Table of Contents
For the year ended December 31, 2022, we performed a quantitative assessment for the HEYDUDE Brand reporting unit goodwill and the HEYDUDE Brand indefinite-lived intangible assets, each of which indicated the estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values.
Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we performed a qualitative assessment for the goodwill in our Crocs Brand segment, which indicated that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value.
Changes in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets could result in impairment charges in future periods as the key assumptions are inherently uncertain, require significant judgment and are subject to change based on, among others, industry and geopolitical conditions, our ability to navigate changing macroeconomic conditions and trends as well as the timing and success of strategic initiatives. Certain factors, such as failure to achieve forecasted revenue growth rates, EBITDA, or increases in the discount rates, have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair values of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets that could result in impairment charges. See also the risk factor under 
“Financial and Accounting Risks — We may incur impairments of the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.”
We did not record any impairment charges in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, or 2022 based on the results of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing. Refer to Note 1 — Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net, Net in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
Property and equipment, right-of-use assets, and definite-lived intangible assets, such as customer relationships and capitalized software, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable. This represents a critical accounting policy as our impairment evaluations include significant judgments and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. Testing of long-lived assets for impairment is at the level of an asset group, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In our retail business, the asset group for impairment testing is each individual retail store. For customer relationships, impairment testing is performed at the customer group level. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition, where applicable. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell.
In determining future cash flows, we take various factors into account, including the remaining useful life of each asset group, forecasted growth rates, pricing, working capital, capital expenditures, and other cash needs specific to the asset group. Additional considerations when assessing impairment include changes in our strategic operational and financial decisions, global and regional economic conditions, demand for our product, and other corporate initiatives which may eliminate or significantly decrease the realization of future benefits from our long-lived assets. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, future impairments may arise in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations.
In 2024, we recorded non-cash impairments of $18.2 million for information technology systems related to the HEYDUDE integration and $5.9 million related to our former HEYDUDE Brand warehouse in Las Vegas, Nevada and our former Crocs Brand warehouse in Oudenbosch, the Netherlands. In 2023, we recorded non-cash impairments of $9.3 million related to our former corporate headquarters. In 2022, we did not record impairments to reduce the net carrying value of certain long-lived assets. See Note 8 — Fair Value Measurements in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8.

Revenues and Reserves for Sales Returns and Allowances
While our revenue recognition does not involve significant judgment, it does represent a key accounting policy as it is important to our results of operations. Revenues are recognized in the amount expected to be received when control of the product transfers to customers. Revenues are reported net of various promotions, which range from contractually-fixed percentage price reductions to sales returns, discounts, rebates, and other incentives that may vary in amount, must be estimated, and are reported as a reduction in revenues. An area of judgment affecting our reported revenues and net income involves estimating reserves for sales returns and allowances, which represent a portion of revenues not expected to be realized. Revenues in our direct-to-consumer channels are reduced by an estimate of returns. We may also accept returns from our wholesale customers, on an exception basis, to ensure that our products are merchandised in the proper assortments and may provide markdown allowances at our sole discretion to key wholesalers and distributors to facilitate sales of slower moving products. Wholesale revenues are reduced by estimates of returns and allowances. 
Our estimated sales returns and allowances are based on customer return history and actual outstanding returns yet to be received. Changes to our estimates for customer returns and allowances may be caused by many factors, including, but not limited to, whether customers accept our new styles, customer inventory levels, shipping delays or errors, known or suspected product defects, the seasonal nature of our products, and macroeconomic factors affecting our customers. Historically, actual amounts of customer returns, allowances, discounts, and rebates have not differed significantly from our estimates. A hypothetical 1% increase in our reserves for returns and allowances as of December 31, 2024 would have had an insignificant impact on our 2024 revenues.

Income Taxes
Intellectual Property Income Tax Implications 
During 2024, we completed an intra-entity transaction related to certain intellectual property (“IP”) rights primarily to align with current and future international operations. The transaction was executed using transfer pricing guidelines issued by the relevant taxing authorities. Significant estimates and assumptions were required to compute the valuation of this transaction. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, estimated future revenue growth, which is inherently uncertain and, therefore, may ultimately differ materially from our actual results. Foreign deferred tax assets increased by $268.8 million and this benefit was offset by an increase in uncertain tax positions of $145.6 million. As such, a net change in deferred tax asset of $123.2 million was recognized along with a corresponding foreign income tax benefit. 
In 2024, we received new information and remeasured the reserve for uncertain tax positions related to the 2020 and 2021 
intellectual property
 rights transactions which resulted in the release of uncertain tax positions of $141.2 million along with a corresponding foreign income tax benefit. 
In 2023, we completed transactions that created an amortizable step-up in tax basis of the intangible asset and a corresponding increase in foreign deferred tax assets based on the fair value of that IP. These transactions were also executed using transfer pricing guidelines issued by the relevant taxing authorities. Significant estimates and assumptions were required to compute the valuation of these transactions. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, estimated future revenue growth and discount rates, which by their nature are inherently uncertain and, therefore, may ultimately differ materially from our actual results. As of December 31, 2023, the related net deferred tax asset was $310.7 million, net of a reserve for uncertain tax positions of $318.6 million and a valuation allowance of $164.0 million for amounts not more-likely-than-not to be realized based on available objective evidence. As of December 31, 2024, the related net deferred tax asset was $271.7 million, net of a reserve for uncertain tax positions of $314.8 million and a valuation allowance of $184.7 million for amounts not more-likely-than-not to be realized based on available objective evidence.
In 2020 and in 2021, we completed transactions that created an amortizable step-up in tax basis of the intangible asset and a corresponding increase in foreign deferred tax assets based on the fair value of that IP. These transactions were also executed using transfer pricing guidelines issued by the relevant taxing authorities. Significant estimates and assumptions were required to compute the valuation of these transactions. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, estimated future revenue growth and discount rates, which by their nature are inherently uncertain and, therefore, may ultimately differ materially from our actual results. As of December 31, 2021, the related net deferred tax asset was $490.2 million, net of a reserve for uncertain tax positions of $206.0 million. As of December 31, 2022, the related net deferred tax asset was $438.5 million, net of a reserve for uncertain tax positions of $194.4 million. As of December 31, 2023, the related net deferred tax asset was $427.1 million, net of a reserve for uncertain tax positions of $200.5 million. As of December 31, 2024, the related net deferred tax asset was $377.1 million, net of a reserve for uncertain tax positions of $46.8 million. In 2024, we received new information and remeasured the reserve for uncertain tax positions related to the 2020 and 2021 intellectual property rights transactions which resulted in the release of uncertain tax positions of $141.2 million along with a corresponding foreign income tax benefit. 
In order to support and sustain the amortizable tax basis for these transactions (and associated deferred tax asset, net of uncertain tax position), we must demonstrate economic ownership, including the appropriate authority and expertise to manage the IP owned and serviced in the Netherlands and Singapore. The determination of economic substance is a judgment that has to be evaluated by management on a continual basis requiring understanding and expertise of local laws of each associated tax jurisdiction. The Netherlands and Singapore subsidiaries serve as the primary corporate headquarters outside of the U.S. and already perform significant functions in support of the economic ownership of the IP. In 2024, we undertook many additional activities to align business operations that support the economic substance of the IP.
We have also recorded certain tax reserves to address potential differences involving our income tax positions. These potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions. While our tax position is not uncertain, because of the significant estimates used in the value of certain intellectual property rights, our tax reserves contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. It is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially more or less than the amount that we estimated.

Income Tax Accounting
We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of other assets and liabilities. We provide for income taxes at the current and future enacted tax rates and laws applicable in each taxing jurisdiction. We account for the tax effects of global intangible low tax income (“GILTI”) as a component of income tax expense in the period the tax arises, to the extent applicable. We use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. The impact of an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained. No portion of an uncertain tax position will be recognized if the position has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Interest expense is recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax positions. While the validity of any tax position is a matter of tax law, the body of statutory, regulatory and interpretive guidance on the application of the law is complex and often ambiguous. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the ‘Income tax expense (benefit)’ line in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.
We evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, taxable income in prior carry back years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required unless management determines that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset. We determine on a regular basis the amount of undistributed earnings that will be indefinitely reinvested in our non-U.S. operations. This assessment is based on the cash flow projections and operational and fiscal objectives of each of our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. Foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on cumulative undistributed foreign earnings of the non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024, which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S.

ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences, and overall financing strategies. Our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our Revolving Facility and certain financial instruments.
As of December 31, 2024, we had borrowings with a face value of $1,390.0 million, comprised of the Notes, which carry a fixed interest rate, the Term Loan B Facility, and the Revolving Facility. We also had $0.6 million in outstanding letters of credit under our Revolving Facility as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, we had long-term borrowings with a face value of $1,713.3 million and $1.3 million in outstanding letters of credit under our Revolving Facility.
A hypothetical increase of 1% in the interest rate on the variable rate borrowings under our Term Loan B Facility and Revolving Facility would increase our interest expense over the next twelve months by $6.9 million based on the balances outstanding for these borrowings as of December 31, 2024.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Changes in exchange rates have a direct effect on our reported USD consolidated financial statements because we translate the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries to USD using current period exchange rates. Specifically, we translate the statements of income of our foreign subsidiaries into the USD reporting currency using exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. As a result, comparisons of reported results between reporting periods may be impacted significantly due to differences in the exchange rates in effect at the time such exchange rates are used to translate the operating results of our international subsidiaries.
An increase of 1% of the value of the USD relative to foreign currencies would have decreased our revenues and income before taxes during the year ended December 31, 2024 by approximately $16.1 million and $2.8 million, respectively. The volatility of the exchange rates is dependent on many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy.
In order to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency and to reduce the volatility in earnings caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, we enter into forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currency. Changes in the fair value of these forward contracts are recognized in earnings in the period that the changes occur or in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings for derivatives classified as non-hedged or hedged, respectively, as defined in Note 1 — Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. 
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data 
of this Annual Report on this Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2024, the USD notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts was approximately $239.6 million. The fair value of these contracts at December 31, 2024 was an insignificant liability. See Part I -
