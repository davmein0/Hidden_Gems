ITEM 1. Business
The Company
Crocs, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) are engaged in the design, development, worldwide marketing, distribution, and sale of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for all. We strive to be the world leader in innovative casual footwear, combining comfort and style with a value that consumers want. 
On February 17, 2022 (the “Acquisition Date”), we acquired (the “Acquisition”) 100% of the equity of a privately-owned casual footwear brand business (“HEYDUDE”). HEYDUDE is engaged in the business of distributing and selling casual footwear under the brand name “HEYDUDE.” The majority of HEYDUDE sales are currently in the United States.
We have two reportable operating segments: the Crocs Brand and the HEYDUDE Brand, which are discussed in more detail in “Business Segments and Geographic Information” below.
Our Vision
At the heart of our brands are our consumers. We have brands with a broad democratic appeal and accessible price points, which are aligned with global megatrends such as casualization, comfort, and personalization. The philosophy and vision for our brands have been important drivers of our results and, we believe, will continue to be important as we strive to realize the full global potential of our brands. To that end, in 2024, we continued our message of “Come As You Are” for the Crocs Brand and the slogan “Good To Go-To” for the HEYDUDE Brand.
Our enterprise growth priorities are centered around three strategic areas of focus:
•
Ignite our icons to drive awareness and relevance for our brands — 
Central to our Crocs Brand’s DNA are our clogs, sandals, and Jibbitz™ charms, which are key product pillars that we believe will drive long-term growth. Our Classic Clog is our icon, and we continue to grow our broader clog silhouette with new designs, colors, graphics, licensed properties and collaborations. The addition of the HEYDUDE Brand to our portfolio provides opportunity to play in a broader casual footwear market. The brand is known for its versatility, easy on and off characteristics, and comfort. The Wendy and Wally are distinct and innovative loafer silhouettes and represent our icons.
•
Drive market share gains across our Tier 1 markets through strategic investment in talent, marketing, digital, and retail — 
For the Crocs Brand, we are focused on six Tier 1 markets: (i) China, (ii) India, (iii) Japan, (iv) South Korea, (v), the U.S., and (vi) Western Europe. Our international sales in 2024 were 44.1% of Crocs Brand revenues compared to 41.0% and 38.2% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. For the HEYDUDE Brand, which predominantly operates in the United States, we have embarked, and plan to continue to embark, on various marketing activities to drive higher awareness. This includes developing a pipeline of collaborations and brand activations. We have rightsized HEYDUDE’s wholesale distribution footprint and are evolving our channel diversification strategy through the thoughtful development of premium outlet retail stores. At the end of 2024 and 2023, we had a fleet of 52 and 14 HEYDUDE Brand outlet stores, respectively.
Across our portfolio, leading with digital remains a priority. Digital sales include sales directly to consumers through our company-owned websites and third-party marketplaces as well as wholesale sales to our global e-tailers. Our digital sales in 2024 were 37.2% of consolidated revenues, compared to 37.9% and 37.8% of consolidated revenues in 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
•
Attract new consumers by diversifying our product range and wearing occasions — 
For the Crocs Brand, we see opportunity to attract new consumers by driving diversification in wearing occasions. We believe sandals are a natural extension of the Crocs Brand and allow us to access new consumers by leveraging our signature molding technology to provide casual, comfortable footwear for a variety of wearing occasions. In addition to the development of our sandals product pillar, we see further opportunity to expand into broader footwear silhouettes and lifestyle occasions. For the HEYDUDE Brand, our primary focus is diversification within our core Wendy and Wally silhouettes, while pursuing natural extensions into sneakers, dress casual, boots and sandals.

Products
Since we first introduced a single-style clog in six colors in 2002, we have grown to be a world leader of innovative, casual footwear for all. We offer a broad portfolio of all-season products, while remaining true to our core casual footwear heritage.
Crocs Brand
Recognized globally for our unmistakable iconic molded clog silhouette, we have taken the successful formula of a simple design aesthetic, paired it with modern comfort, and expanded into a wide variety of casual footwear products including sandals—wedges, flips, and slides—that meet the needs of the whole family. Our mission of “everyone comfortable in their own shoes” continued in 2024 as we repeatedly brought our consumers new silhouettes, compelling collaborations, trend-right colors and graphics, and increased personalization through our Jibbitz™ charms accessories. 
The vast majority of Crocs™ shoes feature Croslite™ material, a proprietary, revolutionary technology that gives each pair of shoes the soft, comfortable, and lightweight qualities that our fans know and love. We also use Croslite™ material formulations in connection with material technologies used in our visible comfort collections, such as our LiteRide™ and Free Feel Technology™ products. Our products containing LiteRide™ and Free Feel Technology™ feature comfort-focused, proprietary foam insoles which are soft, lightweight, and resilient.
HEYDUDE Brand
The HEYDUDE Brand offers shoes with an iconic and versatile loafer silhouette with many wearing occasions that focus on casualization, comfort-led functionality, and personalization. The HEYDUDE Brand utilizes leading technologies including a flex-and-fold outsole and ergonomic insole. The shoes are known for being lightweight, flexible, and soft, with design and functional flexibility for convenience. 
Marketing
Each season, we focus on presenting compelling brand stories and experiences for our new product introductions as well as our ongoing core products. We employ social and digital marketing centered on showcasing our clog, sandal silhouettes, and Jibbitz™ charms for the Crocs Brand and our versatile loafer silhouette for the HEYDUDE Brand. We continue to invest in partnerships including McDonald’s, Toy Story, Simone Rocha, Sydney Sweeney, and Jelly Roll. Innovation is not only core to our brands’ values; it is at the forefront of how we drive consumer acquisition and engagement. We strive to listen and respond quickly to our customers to give them new and innovative reasons to continue to choose the Crocs and HEYDUDE brands.

Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Initiatives
As one of the world’s largest footwear companies, we aim to make a positive impact on the global footwear industry, for people, and for our planet. Our 2024 Comfort Report, which is expected to be published in the first half of 2025, is our fourth annual publication that provides an explanation of our progress towards our purpose of creating a more comfortable world for all. Our Comfort Report will be made available on the Investor Relations section of our website located at www.investors.crocs.com. Except where specified otherwise, all information in the forthcoming Comfort Report and below corporate responsibility and sustainability (“CRS”) discussion pertains to Crocs, Inc. as of December 31, 2024. The content provided in our Comfort Report or accessible through our website is not incorporated by reference as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We are continuously evaluating our business practices towards our goal of consistently delivering products that exceed customer and consumer expectations while meeting all regulatory and compliance requirements. We believe the progress of our sustainability efforts is best understood through transparent and comparable disclosures and, to this end, we continue to align our reporting with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) and the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) frameworks.

Environmental
We are committed to taking steps to reduce our impact on the environment and are particularly focused on carbon reduction, sustainable operations, and product circularity. 
In 2024, we completed a greenhouse gas inventory for the Crocs, Inc. enterprise, including both the Crocs and HEYDUDE brands, based on 2023 data. We also updated our 2022 and 2021 emissions based on updates in calculation methodology due to more accurate emission factors and advancements in data quality. In 2024, we increased the amount of bio-circular materials in our Croslite™ compound, reaching 25% bio-circular content on a mass balance basis as verified by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (“ISCC PLUS”), supporting our journey to Net Zero by 2040. We also maintained our membership with Cascale (formerly the Sustainable Apparel Coalition), continued to progress the work of the Footwear Collective as a founding member and enhanced the tracking of our energy use, water use, and waste generation.
In 2024, we also expanded “Old Crocs New Life,” a circularity program in the United States and Canada that allows our Crocs consumers to return their gently worn or well-loved Crocs shoes to over 160 retail stores or via a mail-back initiative to be donated to communities in need or repurposed into something new. We also launched our first “Keep it Going” classic clog, made of 25% post-consumer recycled content created from Crocs shoes we’ve taken back.
More detail on these initiatives, as well as our ambitions, will be provided in our upcoming Comfort Report.
Social
As of December 31, 2024, we employed more than 7,910 employees globally, including approximately 4,560 employees in our retail stores, 2,300 employees at our corporate/regional offices, and 1,050 employees at our distribution centers.
We believe we have one of the most talented workforces in the footwear industry and continue to improve and implement new initiatives to remain an employer of choice across all of our businesses and geographies. These initiatives include pay transparency in hiring, offering employee training and developing leadership capabilities, enabling meaningful professional experiences, offering a compelling employee value proposition, and creating a collaborative culture. We strive to create a culture of inclusion through people-practices that support and empower all employees. We are proud of the workplace culture we have created. To that end, our regular employee engagement scores continue to reflect a highly engaged global workforce.
Our efforts around inclusion, collaboration, and human rights extend through our supply chain. We work to ensure our products are sourced, produced, and delivered to our customers in a manner that upholds international labor and human rights standards, inclusive of occupational safety and chemical safety. In addition, we maintain numerous measures to ensure our supply chain complies with our Social Compliance Code of Conduct, Restricted Substances Policy, and Human Rights Policy, as well as with local laws and customs regarding hiring practices, wages, and working conditions.
We also seek to extend the reach of our impact through our global community giving program. In 2024, we launched our “Step Up to Greatness” program focused on supporting non-profit partners that help young people build new skills, grow confidence, and open doors to new opportunities. We also partnered with Big Brothers Big Sisters, the largest youth mentoring organization in the United States, to support them in empowering young people. We continued to show up for our communities in times of need, donating shoes and funds in the wake of crises, such as the impacts following the hurricanes in the southeastern United States in 2024. 
Governance
Strong corporate governance mechanisms, along with robust internal controls over our financial reporting framework, are the foundation for our progress toward our environmental and social ambitions. The basis of this is our Board of Directors (the “Board”), which was comprised of 22% female and 22% historically underrepresented racial/ethnic members as of December 31, 2024.
In 2024, our Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Steering Committee (the “CRS Committee”) of our Board, comprised of three independent directors, continued its oversight of our CRS efforts and received quarterly updates on the development of our CRS program. Specifically, the CRS Committee assisted the Board in (i) carrying out the responsibilities delegated by the Board regarding the review and oversight of our goals, policies, procedures and disclosures related to sustainability and CRS matters and (ii) its oversight of the sustainability and CRS matters material to us, our employees, our communities, and the planet. Additionally, we regularly review our Enterprise Risk Management and Ethics & Compliance program frameworks to account for our social and environmental risks and opportunities, specifically including those related to climate change. All

material findings and updates are elevated to and discussed with our Board quarterly by our Chief Sustainability Officer, who reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer.
We believe our employees are critical to the maintenance of strong corporate governance and, to that end, we continue to conduct annual in-person and online compliance trainings for all corporate employees, as well as retail and distribution center management. We also maintain a global ethics hotline, which is monitored by our Legal department, should any of our stakeholders identify concerns or have grievances.
Distribution Channels 
The broad appeal of our footwear has allowed us to market our products in more than 80 countries through two distribution channels: wholesale and direct-to-consumer (“DTC”).
Wholesale Channel
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, 50.3%, 52.0%, and 54.9% of our consolidated revenues, respectively, were derived through our wholesale channel. Our wholesale channel includes domestic and international multi-brand retailers, mono-branded partner stores, e-tailers, and distributors. Brick-and-mortar customers typically include family footwear retailers, international, national, and regional retail chains, sporting goods stores, and independent footwear retailers.
Outside the U.S., we use distributors when we believe such arrangements are economically preferable to direct sales. Distributors purchase products pursuant to a price list and are granted the right to resell those products in a defined territory, usually a country or group of countries. Our typical distribution agreements have terms of one to five years and can be terminated or renegotiated if minimum requirements or other terms are not met.
Direct-to-Consumer Channel
Our DTC channel includes company-operated e-commerce sites, third-party marketplaces, company-operated full-price retail stores, outlet stores, and kiosks/store-in-store locations. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, 49.7%, 48.0%, and 45.1%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues were derived through our DTC channel. 
E-commerce
As of December 31, 2024, we offered our products through 23 company-operated e-commerce sites worldwide and also on third-party marketplaces. Our e-commerce presence facilitates a greater connection with our consumers and provides us with an opportunity to educate them about our products and brands. We continue to leverage increasingly sophisticated digital marketing activities to enhance the consumer experience and drive sales, thereby benefiting from the continued migration of consumers to online shopping.
Retail 
With the continued worldwide consumer shift toward e-commerce, we carefully manage our retail fleet, especially full-priced retail stores. As of December 31, 2024, we had 390 and 52 company-operated stores for the Crocs Brand and HEYDUDE Brand, respectively.
Our company-operated full-price retail stores allow us to effectively showcase the full extent of our product range to consumers and provide us with the opportunity to interact with those consumers directly. As of December 31, 2024, we had 87 full-price Crocs Brand retail stores.
Our company-operated outlet stores allow us to sell discontinued and overstocked merchandise directly to consumers at discounted prices. We also sell full-priced products in our outlet stores as well as built-for-outlet products. As of December 31, 2024, we had 232 Crocs Brand outlet stores and 52 HEYDUDE Brand outlet stores, of which 9 were clearance locations.
Our company-operated kiosks and store-in-store locations allow us to market specific product lines, with flexibility to tailor products to consumer preferences in shopping malls and other high foot-traffic areas. With efficient use of retail space and limited fixed cost and capital investment, we believe kiosks and store-in-store locations can be effective vehicles for selling our products in certain geographic areas. As of December 31, 2024, we had 71 Crocs Brand kiosks and store-in-store locations.

Raw Materials
Crocs Brand
Croslite™, our proprietary closed-cell resin material, incorporates the primary material formulations used in the vast majority of our Crocs Brand footwear and some of our accessories. Our Croslite™

materials are formulated to create soft, comfortable, and lightweight footwear. We continue to invest in research and development to refine our materials to enhance these properties, develop new properties for specific applications, as well as reduce our environmental impact through various sustainability initiatives described in the previous section.
Croslite™ is produced by compounding elastomer resins, purchased from major chemical manufacturers, with certain other production inputs such as color dyes. Multiple suppliers produce the elastomer resins used in the Croslite™ material. In the future, we may identify and utilize materials produced by other suppliers as an alternative to, or in addition to, those elastomer resins. All other raw materials that we use to produce the Croslite™ formulations are readily available for purchase from multiple suppliers.
Some of the products we offer are constructed using textile fabrics or other material formulations, such as those we brand LiteRide™ and Free Feel Technology™. These materials are obtained from a number of third-party sources, and we believe these materials are also broadly available.

Table of Contents
HEYDUDE Brand
The primary raw materials for the HEYDUDE Brand are fabrics, including polyester and cotton, Ethylene-vinyl acetate (“EVA”) insoles and outsoles, and other materials such as leather and polyurethane. We purchase this material from a select group of third-party sources, and we believe these materials are broadly available.
Sourcing
Our sourcing strategy is to maintain a flexible, globally-diversified, cost-efficient third-party manufacturing base. We source our inventory production from multiple third-party manufacturers, primarily in:
•
Vietnam for the Crocs Brand. We have additional third-party manufacturers in China, Indonesia, India, and Mexico, among other countries.

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, approximately 51%, 56%, and 53%, respectively, of our Crocs Brand production was in Vietnam. Our largest third-party manufacturer for the Crocs Brand, with the majority of operations in Vietnam, produced approximately 50%, 47%, and 42% of our production during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and our second largest third-party manufacturer for the Crocs Brand, primarily operating in both Vietnam and China, produced approximately 25%, 26%, and 27% of our production during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
•
China for the HEYDUDE Brand. We have additional third-party manufacturers in Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, and India. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately 58% and 83%, respectively, of our HEYDUDE Brand production was in China. During the partial period beginning on the Acquisition Date through December 31, 2022 (the “Partial Period”), the vast majority of production was in China for the HEYDUDE Brand.
We believe any potential concentration risk is mitigated by the fact that the manufacturing capabilities required to produce our footwear are broadly available for both brands. Nonetheless, see the risk factors under 
“Risks Related to our Supply Chain — We depend solely on third-party manufacturers located outside of the U.S.” and “Risks Related to International Operations —Government actions and regulations, such as export restrictions, tariffs, and other trade protection measures could adversely affect our business” 
included in
