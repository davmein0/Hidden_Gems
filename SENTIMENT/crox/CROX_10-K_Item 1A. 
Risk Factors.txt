Item 1A. 
Risk Factors
 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of risks to our business and financial results associated with foreign currencies.
We perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts. To perform the sensitivity analysis, we assess the risk of changes in fair values from the effect of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This analysis assumes a like movement by the foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio against the USD. As of December 31, 2024, a 10% appreciation in the value of the USD would result in a net decrease in the fair value of our derivative portfolio of approximately $3.0 million.
See Item 7.

ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation (pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act) of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2024.
Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management necessarily applies its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures that, by their nature, can only provide reasonable assurance regarding management’s control objectives.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective due to changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the framework and criteria established in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
Our independent registered public accounting firm has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, as stated in their report, which appears herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the three months ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Crocs, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Crocs, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 13, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Crocs, Inc. 
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Crocs, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 13, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Income Taxes – Evaluation of the Deferred Tax Asset resulting from Intra-entity Intellectual Property Transaction — Refer to Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company recognizes deferred income taxes for tax attributes and for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized. The Company takes a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. The impact of an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained. No portion of an uncertain tax position will be recognized if the position has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained.  
During 2024, the Company completed an intra-entity transaction related to certain intellectual property rights primarily to align with current and future international operations and a corresponding increase in foreign deferred tax assets based on the fair value of certain intellectual property (“IP”) rights. The transaction was executed using transfer pricing guidelines issued by the relevant taxing authorities. Significant estimates and assumptions were required to compute the valuation of the transaction. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, estimated future revenue growth, which by their nature are inherently uncertain and, therefore, may ultimately differ materially from actual results. Foreign deferred tax assets increased by $268.8 million, which was offset by an increase in uncertain tax positions of $145.6 million for amounts not more-likely-than-not to be realized based on available objective evidence. As such, a net change in deferred tax asset of $123.2 million was recognized along with a corresponding foreign income tax benefit.
F- 2
Table of Contents
We identified management’s valuation of the deferred tax asset and related uncertain tax positions resulting from the Company’s transaction of certain intellectual property as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments and estimates that were required to be made by management to properly value the deferred tax asset and uncertain tax positions. The judgments and estimates were related to the Company’s interpretation of related tax laws and regulations, as well as the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future events.
As a result, we utilized a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions for the measurement of the deferred tax asset related to the forecasts of future revenue growth. We also utilized a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax and transfer pricing specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate whether management’s judgments in interpreting and applying tax laws and estimates and assumptions regarding future settlements were appropriate in determining the value of the uncertain tax positions.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures, performed with the assistance of our tax and transfer pricing specialists, related to the Company’s evaluation of the deferred tax asset resulting from the intra-entity IP transaction included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the determination of the measurement of deferred tax asset, such as controls related to management’s forecasts of future revenues, and management’s controls over the measurement of the uncertain tax position, such as controls related to the evaluation of subjective estimates in the amounts to be realized. 
•
We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s revenue forecasts by comparing to:
–
Historical revenue growth rates
–
Historical revenue growth of peer companies
–
Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors 
–
Forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports 
–
Expected macroeconomic trends.
•
With the assistance of our tax and transfer pricing specialists, we evaluated the measurement of uncertain tax positions. Our procedures included the following, among others:
–
Reviewed the Company’s analysis of the uncertain tax positions and evaluated the reasonableness of the assumptions and calculations the Company used to develop the amount of the related uncertain tax positions.
–
Obtained the Company’s supporting documentation to assess the technical tax merits applicable to local country, international tax, and transfer pricing standards, the more-likely-than-not recognition and measurement thresholds and evaluated the application of these relevant tax laws in the Company’s recognition determination.
–
Evaluated the Company’s measurement of the liability using our knowledge of international, domestic, and local income tax laws, as well as settlement activity from the relevant income tax authorities.

100
% of the equity of a privately-owned casual footwear brand business (“HEYDUDE”). HEYDUDE is engaged in the business of distributing and selling casual footwear under the brand name “HEYDUDE.”
We have 
two
 reportable operating segments: the Crocs Brand and the HEYDUDE Brand. See Note 17 — Operating Segments and Geographic Information for additional information.
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and they reflect all adjustments which are necessary for a fair statement of results of operations, financial position, and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions used to determine certain amounts that affect the financial statements are reasonable, based on information available at the time they are made. Management believes that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions made when accounting for items and matters such as, but not limited to, the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates, sales returns and allowances, impairment assessments and charges, recoverability of long-lived assets, deferred tax assets, valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, income tax expense, share-based compensation expense, the assessment of lower of cost or net realizable value on inventory, useful lives assigned to long-lived assets, goodwill, and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and purchase price allocation for the Acquisition, as described in Note 3 — Acquisition of HEYDUDE, are reasonable based on information available at the time they are made.
Additionally, we are periodically exposed to various contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including certain litigation, contractual disputes, employee relations matters, various tax or other governmental audits, and trademark and intellectual property matters and disputes. We record a liability for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude their occurrence is probable and the related losses are estimable. If it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement of a contingency could exceed the established liability, we disclose the estimated impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations, if practicable. As the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable, these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and governmental actions. As a result, the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on management’s judgment in developing the related estimates and assumptions. See Note 16 — Commitments and Contingencies and Note 18 — Legal Proceedings for additional information regarding our contingencies and legal proceedings.
To the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected.
Reclassifications 
We have reclassified certain amounts on the consolidated statements of income, in Note 6 — Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities, in Note 14 — Income Taxes, and in Note 17 — Operating Segments and Geographic Information to conform to current period presentation.

Table of Contents
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly-liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase. We report receivables from credit card companies in cash and cash equivalents.
Accounts Receivable, Net
Accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts, net of reserves and allowances. We reduce the carrying value for estimated uncollectible accounts based on a variety of factors including the length of time receivables are past due, economic trends and conditions affecting our customer base, and historical collection experience. Specific provisions are recorded for individual receivables when we become aware of a customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations. We write off accounts receivable to the reserves when they are deemed uncollectible or, in certain jurisdictions, when legally able to do so. See Schedule II in Item 15. 
Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedule 
of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Inventories
Inventories are comprised of finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and are recognized using the first-in-first-out method of inventory costing. We estimate the market value of inventory based on an analysis of historical sales trends of our individual product lines, the impact of market trends and economic conditions, and a forecast of future demand, giving consideration to the value of current orders in-house for future sales of inventory, as well as plans to sell discontinued or end-of-life inventory through our outlet stores, among other off-price channels. Estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity, quality, and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences, and market conditions. If the estimated market value is less than its carrying value, the carrying value is adjusted to the market value, and the difference is recorded in ‘Cost of sales’ in our consolidated statements of income. 
Reserves for the risk of physical loss of inventory are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts, and they are recorded within ‘Cost of sales’ in our consolidated statements of income.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property, equipment, furniture, and fixtures are stated at original cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided using

the straight-line method over the estimated useful asset lives. The useful lives are reviewed periodically and typically range from 
2
 to 
10
 years for machinery and equipment and furniture, fixtures and others. Leasehold improvements are stated at cost and amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic useful lives or the lease term, whichever is shorter. Costs of enhancements or modifications that substantially extend the capacity or useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated accordingly. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Depreciation of warehouse- and distribution-related assets is included in ‘Cost of sales’ in our consolidated statements of income. Depreciation related to retail store, corporate, and non-product assets is included in ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ in our consolidated statements of income. When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our consolidated balance sheets, and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is reflected in ‘Income from operations’ in the consolidated statements of income.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net
We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually or when an interim triggering event has occurred indicating potential impairment.  
The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of acquired net assets represents goodwill. Our goodwill balance as of December 31, 2024 was $
711.5
 million and primarily related to the Acquisition. As of December 31, 2024, a goodwill amount of $
710.0
 million was assigned to the HEYDUDE Brand segment and consisted of the acquired workforce and economies of scale resulting from the Acquisition.
F- 10
Table of Contents
When performing our annual test for impairment, we may assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for potential impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative assessment. Significant judgments and assumptions are required in such impairment evaluations. 
For the quantitative assessment, we compare the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded. For the year ended 
December 31, 2024
, we performed a quantitative assessment for the HE
YDUDE Brand reporting unit goodwill and the HEYDUDE Brand indefinite-lived intangible assets. The estimated fair values of the HEYDUDE Brand reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark exceeded their carrying values. For the year ended December 31, 2023, we performed a 
qualitative and 
quantitative assessment for the HEYDUDE Brand reporting unit goodwill, and we performed a quantitative assessment for the HEYDUDE Brand indefinite-lived intangible assets, each of which indicated the estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we performed a quantitative assessment for the HEYDUDE Brand reporting unit goodwill and the HEYDUDE Brand indefinite-lived intangible assets, each of which indicated the estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values. Additionally for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we performed a qualitative assessment for the goodwill in our Crocs Brand segment, which indicated that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value. We did not record any impairment charges in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, or 2022 based on the results of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing.
We continuously monitor the performance of our definite-lived intangible assets, which includes software, customer relationships, patents, copyrights, and certain trademarks, and evaluate for impairment when evidence exists that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Significant judgments and assumptions are required in such impairment evaluations. Definite-lived intangible assets are stated at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets.
We amortize our customer relationships on a straight-line basis over a useful life of 
15
 years. Amortization for patents, copyrights, and trademarks is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful asset lives, which are reviewed periodically and typically range from 
7
 to 
25
 years.
Internal-Use Software and Cloud Computing Arrangements
We capitalize direct costs of materials and services used in the development and purchase of internal-use software. Amounts capitalized are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of 
2
 to 
8
 years and are reported as a component of ‘Intangible assets, net’ in the consolidated balance sheets.
We also capitalize certain costs incurred during the application development stage of implementation of internal-use software in cloud computing arrangements. Amounts capitalized are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected length of the related contract and are reported as a component of ‘Other assets’ in the consolidated balance sheets.
Amortization of capitalized software used in warehouse- and distribution-related activities is included in ‘Cost of sales’ in the consolidated statements of income. Amortization related to corporate and non-product, assets, such as our global information systems, is included in ‘Selling, general, and administrative expenses’ in the consolidated statements of income.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash primarily consists of funds to secure certain retail store leases, certain customs requirements, and other contractual arrangements.
Leases
Our lease portfolio consists primarily of real estate assets, which includes retail, warehouse, distribution center, and office spaces, under operating leases expiring at various dates through 2034. Leases with an original term of twelve months or less are not reported in the consolidated balance sheets; expense for these short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Many leases include 
one
 or more options to renew, with renewal terms that, if exercised by us, may extend the lease term. The exercise of these renewal options is at our discretion. When assessing the likelihood of a renewal or termination, we consider the significance of leasehold improvements, availability of alternative locations, and the cost of relocation or replacement, among other considerations. The depreciable lives of leasehold improvements are the shorter of the useful lives of the improvements or the expected lease term. We determine the lease term for each lease based on the terms of each contract and factor in renewal and early termination options if such options are reasonably certain to be exercised. We do not generally 
F- 11
Table of Contents
believe such options are reasonably certain, and therefore, we have excluded them from the recorded right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities.
Due to our centralized treasury function, we utilize a portfolio approach to discount our lease obligations. We assess the expected lease term at lease inception and discount the lease using a fully-secured annual incremental borrowing rate, adjusted for time value corresponding with the expected lease term. 
Certain of our retail store leases include rental payments based upon a percentage of retail sales in excess of a minimum fixed rental. In some cases, there is no fixed minimum rental, and the entire rental payment is based upon a percentage of sales. In addition, certain leases include rental payments adjusted periodically for changes in price level indices. We recognize expense for these types of payments as incurred and report them as variable lease expense. See Note 7 — Leases for additional information.

Derivative Financial Instruments
We transact business in various foreign entities and are therefore exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk that impacts the reported U.S. Dollar (“USD”) amounts of revenues, expenses, and certain foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities. In order to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency and to reduce the volatility in earnings caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, we may enter into forward contracts to buy and sell foreign currency. By policy, we do not enter into these contracts for trading purposes or speculation.
Counterparty default risk is considered low because the forward contracts we enter into are over-the-counter instruments transacted with highly-rated financial institutions. We were not required to and did not post collateral as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.
Our derivative instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets within either ‘Prepaid expenses and other assets’ or ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged transactions in a cash flow hedge. We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain components of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply, or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.
We report derivative instruments with the same counterparty on a net basis when a master netting arrangement is in place. For the consolidated statements of cash flows, we classify cash flows from derivative instruments at settlement in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items within ‘Cash provided by operating activities.’
As of December 31, 2024, we have derivatives not designated as hedging instruments (“non-hedged derivatives”), which consist of foreign currency forward contracts primarily used to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. For our non-hedged derivatives, changes in fair value are recognized within ‘Foreign currency gains (losses), net’ in the consolidated statements of income.
We also have cash flow hedges (“hedged derivatives”) as of December 31, 2024. We are exposed to fluctuations in various foreign currencies against our functional currency, the USD. Specifically, we have subsidiaries that transact in currencies other than their functional currency. We use cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to our external sales and external purchases of inventory. Currency forward agreements involve fixing the exchange rates for delivery of a specified amount of foreign currency on a specified date. The currency forward agreements are typically cash settled in USD for their fair value at or close to their settlement date. We may also use currency option contracts under which we will pay a premium for the right to sell a specified amount of a foreign currency prior to the maturity date of the option.
For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of foreign exchange risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in ‘Accumulated other comprehensive loss’ in the consolidated balance sheets. In the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings, the related gain or loss is subsequently reclassified to ‘Revenues’ or ‘Cost of sales’ in the consolidated statement of operations, which is consistent with the nature of the hedged transaction.

See Note 9 — Derivative Financial Instruments for further information on derivative financial instruments.
Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Our foreign subsidiaries generally use their foreign currency as their functional currency. Functional currency assets and liabilities are translated into USD using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Resulting translation gains and losses are reported in other comprehensive income (loss), until the substantial liquidation of a subsidiary, at which time accumulated translation gains or losses are reclassified into net income. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a net loss of $
8.1
 million of cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments related to the substantial liquidation of a foreign subsidiary.

Revenues
Revenues are recognized in the amount expected to be received in exchange for when control of the products transfers to customers and excludes various forms of promotions, which range from contractually-fixed percentage price reductions to sales returns, discounts, rebates, and other incentives that may vary in amount, must be estimated, and are reported as a reduction in revenues. Variable amounts are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience and adjusted as better estimates become available. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we recognized 
no
 changes to estimates for wholesale or direct-to-consumer revenues.
We have also elected to expense incremental costs to obtain customer contracts, consisting primarily of commission incentives, when incurred because the related amortization period is less than one year. These costs are reported within ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ in our consolidated statements of income.
The following is a description of our principal revenue-generating activities by distribution channel. We have 
two
 reportable operating segments and sell our products using 
two
 primary distribution channels. For more detailed information about reportable operating segments, see Note 17 — Operating Segments and Geographic Information.
Wholesale Channel
For the majority of wholesale customers, control transfers and revenues are recognized when the product is shipped or delivered from a manufacturing facility or distribution center to the wholesale customer. In certain cases, control of the product transfers and revenues are recognized when the customer receives the product at the designated delivery point. For certain customers, primarily in international markets, cash payment is required in advance of delivery and revenues continue to be recognized upon the transfer of control to the customer. We may accept returns from our wholesale customers, on an exception basis, to ensure that our products are merchandised in the proper assortments and may provide markdown allowances at our sole discretion to key wholesalers and distributors to facilitate sales of slower moving products. Wholesale revenues are reduced by estimates of returns and allowances based on historical experience, and adjustments to our estimates are made when the expected value changes.
We have arrangements that grant certain wholesale customers exclusive licenses, concurrent with the terms of the related distribution agreements, to use our intellectual property in exchange for a sales-based royalty. Sales-based royalty revenues are recognized over the terms of the related license agreements as sales are made by the wholesalers.
Direct-to-Consumer Channel
Direct-to-consumer revenues consist of sales generated through our company-operated retail stores and company-operated e-commerce websites and third-party e-commerce marketplaces. We transfer control of products and recognize revenues at company-operated retail stores at the point of sale, in exchange for cash or other payment. For sales made through company-operated e-commerce websites and third-party e-commerce marketplaces, we transfer control and recognize revenues when the product is shipped from the distribution centers, the point at which payment, primarily through debit and credit card and other e-payment methods, is made. A portion of the transaction price charged to our customers is variable, primarily due to promotional discounts or allowances. When recognizing revenues, the amount of revenues associated with expected sales returns is estimated based on historical experience, and adjustments to our estimates are made when the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive changes. 
For additional information about revenues, see Note 12 — Revenues.
F- 13
Table of Contents
Shipping and Handling Costs and Fees
Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and are included in ‘Cost of sales’ in the consolidated statements of income. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in revenues.
Taxes Assessed by Governmental Authorities
Taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are directly imposed on a revenue transaction, including value added tax, are recorded on a net basis and are therefore excluded from revenues.
Cost of Sales
Our cost of sales includes costs incurred to design, produce, procure, and ship our footwear. These costs include our raw materials, both direct and indirect labor, shipping and handling including freight costs, utilities, maintenance costs, licensing fees, depreciation, amortization, packaging, and other warehouse and distribution overhead and costs.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of labor and outside services, rent expense, bad debt expense, legal costs, amortization of intangible assets, as well as certain depreciation costs related to corporate and non-product assets and share-based compensation. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include costs for our marketing and sales organizations, and other functions including finance, legal, human resources, and information technology.
Our selling, general and administrative expenses include media advertising (television, radio, print, social, digital), tactical advertising (signs, banners, point-of-sale materials) and promotional costs. Advertising production costs are expensed when the advertising is first run. Advertising communication costs are expensed in the periods that the communications occur. Certain of our promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. Endorsement-related expenses are recognized as performance is received over the term of each endorsement agreement.
Total marketing expenses, inclusive of advertising, production, promotion, and agency expenses, including variable marketing expenses, were $
377.5
 million, $
317.4
 million, and $
260.8
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Research, Design and Development Expenses
We continue to dedicate resources to product design and development based on opportunities we identify in the marketplace. We incurred expenses of $
25.6
 million, $
21.4
 million, and $
18.7
 million in research, design, and development activities for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, which are expensed as incurred and are reported in ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ in the consolidated statements of income.
Share-Based Compensation
Restricted Stock Awards (“RSAs”) and Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)
We grant RSAs, service-condition RSUs, performance-condition RSUs, and market-condition RSUs. The grant date fair values of RSAs, service-condition RSUs, and performance-condition RSUs are based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date; the grant date fair value and derived service period of market-condition RSUs are estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model. Our service-condition RSUs vest based on continued service; our performance-condition RSUs vest based on achievement of multiple weighted performance goals, certification of performance achievement by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, and continued service; and our market-condition RSUs vest based on the market price of our stock and continued service. Compensation expense, net of forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For performance-condition RSUs, compensation expense is updated for our expected performance level against performance goals at the end of each reporting period, which involves judgment as to the achievement of certain performance metrics.
See Note 13 — Share-Based Compensation for additional information related to share-based compensation.
F- 14
Table of Contents
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets to be held and used are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is less than the undiscounted cash flows from its use and eventual disposition over its remaining economic life. We assess recoverability by comparing the sum of projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition over the remaining economic life of a long-lived asset or asset group to its carrying value, and record a loss from impairment if the carrying value is more than its undiscounted cash flows. For customer relationships, impairment testing is performed at the customer group level. For assets involved in our retail businesses, the asset group is at the retail store level. As retail store performance will vary in new and existing markets due to many factors, including maturity of the market and brand recognition, we periodically evaluate the fixed assets, leasehold improvements, and right-of-use assets related to our retail locations for impairment. For all other long-lived assets, we perform impairment testing at the asset group level for which separately identifiable cash flows are available. Assets or asset groups to be abandoned are written down to zero in the period it is determined they will no longer be used and are removed entirely from service. See Note 4 — Property and Equipment, Net, Note 5 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net, and Note 7 — Leases for a discussion of impairment losses recorded during the periods presented.
Foreign Currency Gains (Losses), Net
Foreign currency gains (losses), net includes realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement and settlement of foreign-currency transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of an entity and realized and unrealized gains and losses on forward foreign currency exchange derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting.

Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net primarily includes gains and losses associated with activities not directly related to making and selling footwear.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of other assets and liabilities. We provide for income taxes at the current and future enacted tax rates and laws applicable in each taxing jurisdiction. We account for the tax effects of global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) as a component of income tax expense in the period the tax arises, to the extent applicable. We use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.
 See Note 14 — Income Taxes for further discussion.
Earnings per Share
Basic and diluted earnings per common share (“EPS”) is presented using the treasury stock method. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution to common shareholders from securities that could share in our earnings and is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards. Anti-dilutive securities are excluded from diluted EPS.
 See Note 15 — Earnings per Share for additional information.
F- 15
Table of Contents
Fair Value
U.S. GAAP for fair value establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach, and cost approach). We utilize a combination of market and income approaches to value derivative instruments. Our financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. 
The three levels of the hierarchy and the related inputs are as follows:
Level
Inputs
1
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
2
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities; 
Unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or
Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability.
3
Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
We categorize fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy based upon the lowest level of the most significant inputs used to determine fair value.
Our non-financial assets, which primarily consist of property and equipment, right-of-use assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets, are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis and are reported at carrying value. However, on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be fully recoverable (and at least annually for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets), non-financial instruments are assessed for impairment and, if applicable, written down to and recorded at fair value. See Note 8 — Fair Value Measurements for further discussion related to estimated fair value measurements.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
New Accounting Pronouncement Adopted
Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued authoritative guidance related to the segment disclosures. This guidance became effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted and should be applied on a retrospective basis. This standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, but it did require increased disclosures within the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 17 — Operating Segments and Geographic Information for additional information regarding our segment reporting.
Pillar Two Global Minimum Tax
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) has released Pillar Two model rules introducing a 15% global minimum tax rate applied on a country-by-country basis for large multinational corporations. Various jurisdictions we operate in have enacted the legislation with a subset of the rules effective January 1, 2024, and the remaining rules becoming effective January 1, 2025. These new laws did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. There remains uncertainty as to the final Pillar Two rules as the OECD continues to release guidance and modifications to the rules. We are monitoring continuing development of these laws and the potential impact they will have on our Company. We do not anticipate the Pillar Two rules will have a significant impact on our 2025 consolidated financial statements.
New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosure
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued authoritative guidance related to the disclosure of rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This guidance becomes effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted and should be applied on a prospective basis. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, but it will require increased disclosures within the notes to our consolidated financial statements.

Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
In November 2024, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to the disclosure of disaggregation of income statement expenses. This guidance becomes effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 with early adoption permitted and should be applied on a retrospective basis. We do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, but it will require increased disclosures within the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
Other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after December 31, 2024 are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

ACQUISITION OF HEYDUDE
On February 17, 2022, (the “Acquisition Date”), we acquired 
100
% of the equity of HEYDUDE, pursuant to the SPA. HEYDUDE is engaged in the business of distributing and selling casual footwear under the brand name “HEYDUDE.” The Acquisition allows us to diversify and expand our business by adding a second brand to the Crocs, Inc. portfolio.
The aggregate preliminary purchase price at the closing of the Acquisition was $
2.3
 billion. We paid aggregate consideration of $
2.05
 billion in cash (the “Cash Consideration”), subject to adjustment based on, among other things, the cash, indebtedness, transaction expenses, and working capital of the companies comprising HEYDUDE and their respective subsidiaries as of the Acquisition Date, and issued 
2,852,280
 shares of the Company’s common stock to one of the sellers (the “Equity Consideration Shares”). The Equity Consideration Shares were subject to a lock-up period beginning on the Acquisition Date, which has since expired so all of the Equity Consideration Shares have been released from the lock-up. The purchase price paid to the sellers is final.
The Cash Consideration was financed via the Company’s entry into the $
2.0
 billion Term Loan B Facility (as defined below) and $
50.0
 million of borrowings under the Revolving Facility (as defined below). As a result of the Acquisition, HEYDUDE has become wholly owned by us.
Purchase Price Allocation
The Acquisition was accounted for in accordance with the ASC Topic 805 
Business Combinations
. As a result, we have applied acquisition accounting, which requires, among other things, that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the Acquisition Date. For certain assets and liabilities, those fair values were consistent with historical carrying values. The fair value of inventory was determined using both a market approach and a cost approach. With respect to intangible assets, the estimated fair value was based on the Multi-Period Excess Earnings approach for the trademark and the distributor method for the customer relationships. These models used primarily Level 2 and Level 3 inputs, including an estimate of future revenues, future cash flows, and discount rates.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Recurring Fair Value Measurements
The financial assets and liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis consist of our derivative instruments. Our derivative instruments are forward foreign currency exchange contracts. We manage credit risk of our derivative instruments on the basis of our net exposure with our counterparty. All of our derivative instruments are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and are reported in the consolidated balance sheets within either ‘Prepaid expenses and other assets’ or ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ at December 31, 2024 and 2023, netted by counterparty. The fair values of our derivative instruments were an insignificant asset and an insignificant liability at December 31, 2024 and an insignificant asset and an insignificant liability at December 31, 2023. See Note 9 — Derivative Financial Instruments for more information.
The carrying amounts of our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash approximate their fair value and are classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The carrying amounts of our accounts receivable, accounts payable, and current accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate their fair value as recorded due to the short-term maturity of these instruments and are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Our borrowing instruments are recorded at their carrying values in the consolidated balance sheets, which may differ from their respective fair values. The Term Loan B Facility, as described in more detail in Note 10 — Borrowings, is classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The Notes (as defined below) are also classified as Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy and are reported in our consolidated balance sheet at face value, less unamortized issuance costs. The fair value of our Revolving Facility (as defined below) approximates its carrying value at December 31, 2024 and 2023 based on interest rates currently available to us for similar borrowings. 
The carrying values and fair values of our borrowing instruments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were:

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
As of December 31, 2024, we have derivatives not designated as hedging instruments (“non-hedged derivatives”), which consist of foreign currency forward contracts primarily used to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies, and cash flow hedges (“hedged derivatives”), which are used to minimize the variability in cash flows caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to our external sales and external purchases of inventory. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was a gain of $
0.8
 million and a loss of $
0.8
 million, respectively, recognized due to reclassification from ‘Accumulated other comprehensive loss’ to ‘Revenues’ or ‘Cost of sales’ related to our hedged derivatives. During the next twelve months, we estimate that a gain of $
0.4
 million will be reclassified to the consolidated statement of operations.
The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities, net, all of which are classified as Level 2, are reported within either ‘Prepaid expenses and other assets’ or ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ in the consolidated balance sheets and were:

Senior Revolving Credit Facility
In July 2019, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (the “Borrowers”) entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”), with the lenders named therein and PNC Bank, National Association, as a lender and administrative agent for the lenders. Since that time, we have amended the Credit Agreement, which, as amended to date, provides for a revolving credit facility of $
1.0
 billion, which can be increased by an additional $
400.0
 million, subject to certain conditions (the “Revolving Facility”). Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a variable interest rate based on (A) a Base Rate (defined as the highest of (i) the Overnight Bank Funding Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus 
0.25
%, (ii) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and (iii) the Daily Simple SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus 
1.00
%), plus an applicable margin ranging from 
0.25
% to 
0.875
% based on our leverage ratio or 
1.35
% to 
1.975
% for the Daily Simple SOFR based on the leverage ratio, inclusive of a 
0.10
% SOFR adjustment, or (B) the Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus an applicable margin ranging from 
1.35
% to 
1.975
% based on our leverage ratio for one-month interest periods and three-month interest periods, inclusive of a 
0.10
% SOFR adjustment. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by all of the assets of the Borrowers and guaranteed by certain other subsidiaries of the Borrowers.
The Credit Agreement required or requires, as applicable, us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of 
3.00
 to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio of (i) 
4.00
 to 1.00 from the quarter ended March 31, 2022 through, and including, the quarter ended December 31, 2023, (ii) 
3.75
 to 1.00 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, (iii) 
3.50
 to 1.00 for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and (iv) 
3.25
 to 1.00 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and thereafter (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances). The Credit Agreement permits, among other things, (i) stock repurchases subject to certain restrictions, including after giving effect to such stock repurchases, the maximum leverage ratio does not exceed certain levels; and (ii)

 million in outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Facility, which reduces amounts available for borrowing under the Revolving Facility. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $
809.4
 million and $
558.7
 million, respectively, of available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility, which matures in November 2027.
Term Loan B Facility
On February 17, 2022, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Original Term Loan B Credit Agreement”) with Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent and lender, to among other things, finance a portion of the cash consideration for the Acquisition, which was amended on August 8, 2023 (the “August 2023 Amendment”) and on February 13, 2024 (the “February 2024 Amendment”). The Original Term Loan B Credit Agreement, as amended by the August 2023 Amendment and the February 2024 Amendment is referred to herein as the “Term Loan B Credit Agreement”.
The Original Term Loan B Credit Agreement provided for an aggregate term loan B facility in the principal amount of $
2.0
 billion. Prior to the February 2024 Amendment, the outstanding balance was $
820.0
 million. Among other things, the February 2024 Amendment provided for a new $
820.0
 million tranche of term loans (the “2024 Refinancing Term Loans” and, such facility, the “Term Loan B Facility”), to refinance the then-outstanding principal balance. The 2024 Refinancing Term Loans are secured by substantially all of the Company’s and each subsidiary guarantor’s assets on a pari passu basis with their obligations arising from the Term Loan B Credit Agreement and is scheduled to mature on February 17, 2029, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Term Loan B Credit Agreement. Additionally, subject to certain conditions, including, without limitation, satisfying certain leverage ratios, the Company may, at any time, on one or more occasions, add one or more new classes of term facilities and/or increase the principal amount of the loans of any existing class by requesting one or more incremental term facilities.
Pursuant to the reduced interest rate margins applicable to the 2024 Refinancing Term Loans, each term loan borrowing which is an alternate base rate borrowing bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Term Loan B Credit Agreement), plus 
1.25
%. Each term loan borrowing which is a term SOFR borrowing bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Term Loan B Credit Agreement) plus 
2.25
%.
As of December 31, 2024, the Term Loan B Facility was fully drawn with 
no
 remaining borrowing capacity, and we had $
500.0
 million in outstanding principal on the Term Loan B Facility, which matures on February 17, 2029.
The Term Loan B Credit Agreement also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, incurrence financial covenants, representations and warranties, events of default and other provisions. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Term Loan B Credit Agreement.
Asia Revolving Credit Facility
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we had 
one
 revolving credit facility in Asia with Citibank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch (the “Citibank Facility”), which, as amended, provides up to an equivalent of $
15.0
 million.
As of December 31, 2024, we had 
no
 borrowings outstanding on the Citibank Facility. As of December 31, 2023, we had borrowings outstanding of $
3.3
 million on the Citibank Facility.
Senior Notes Issuances
In March 2021, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $
350.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
4.250
% Senior Notes due March 15, 2029 (the “2029 Notes”), pursuant to the indenture related thereto (as amended and/or supplemented to date, the “2029 Notes Indenture”). Additionally, in August 2021, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $
350.0
 million aggregate principal amount of

Interest on each of the 2029 Notes and the 2031 Notes (collectively, the “Notes”) is payable semi-annually. 
F- 26
Table of Contents
The Company had or will have, as applicable, the option to redeem all or any portion of the 2029 Notes, at once or over time, at any time on or after March 15, 2024, at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount thereof, plus a premium declining ratably on an annual basis to par and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The Company also had the option to redeem some or all of the 2029 Notes at any time before March 15, 2024 at a redemption price of 
100
% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus a “make-whole” premium and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, at any time before March 15, 2024, the Company could have redeemed up to

104.250
% of the principal amount with the proceeds from certain equity issuances, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. 
The Company will have the option to redeem all or any portion of the 2031 Notes, at once or over time, at any time on or after August 15, 2026, at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount thereof, plus a premium declining ratably on an annual basis to par and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The Company will also have the option to redeem some or all of the 2031 Notes at any time before August 15, 2026 at a redemption price of

% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2031 Notes at a redemption price of 
104.125
% of the principal amount with the proceeds from certain equity issuances, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption.
The Notes rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior debt, including the Credit Agreement, and are senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s future debt that is, by its term, expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by each of the Company’s restricted subsidiaries that is a borrower or guarantor under the Credit Agreement and by each of the Company’s wholly-owned restricted subsidiaries that guarantees any debt of the Company or any guarantor under any syndicated credit facility or capital markets debt in an aggregate principal amount in excess of $
25.0
 million.
The Indentures contain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; pay dividends or repurchase or redeem capital stock or make other restricted payments; declare or pay dividends or other payments; incur liens; enter into certain types of transactions with the Company’s affiliates; and consolidate or merge with or into other companies. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Notes.

Common Stock Repurchase Program
On April 23, 2021, the Board approved and authorized a program to repurchase up to $
1.0
 billion of our common stock. Additionally, on September 23, 2021, the Board approved an increase of $
1.0
 billion to our share repurchase authorization. The number, price, structure, and timing of the repurchases are at our sole discretion and may be made depending on market conditions, liquidity needs, restrictions under the agreements governing our indebtedness, and other factors. The Board of Directors may suspend, modify, or terminate the program at any time without prior notice. Share repurchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and does not obligate us to acquire any amount of our common stock. Under Delaware state law, these shares are not retired, and we have the right to resell any of the shares repurchased.
During the year ended December 31, 2024 we repurchased 
4.3
 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $
551.2
 million, including commissions. During the year ended December 31, 2023 we repurchased 
1.7
 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $
175.0
 million, including commissions.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we have recorded an accrual for the stock repurchase excise tax of $

Therefore, the amounts shown above for the year ended December 31, 2022 represent results during the Partial Period. The vast majority of HEYDUDE Brand revenues are derived from North America.
Contract Liabilities
Contract liabilities consist of advance cash deposits received from wholesale customers to secure product orders in connection with selling seasons and payments received in advance of delivery. As products are shipped and control transfers, we recognize the deferred revenue in ‘Revenues’ in the consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded an insignificant amount of deferred revenues associated with advance customer deposits in ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ in the consolidated balance sheets.

Refund Liabilities
Refund liabilities, primarily associated with product sales returns, retrospective volume rebates, and early payment discounts are estimated based on an analysis of historical experience, and adjustments to our estimates are made when the expected value changes. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, $
34.3
 million and $
38.6
 million, respectively, of refund liabilities, primarily associated with product returns, were reported in ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ in the consolidated balance sheets.
13. 
SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 
Our share-based compensation awards are issued under the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (“2020 Plan”) and predecessor plan, the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (“2015 Plan”). Any awards that expire or are forfeited under the 2015 Plan become available for issuance under the 2020 Plan. We account for forfeitures as they occur when calculating share-based compensation expense. The aforementioned plans provide for the issuance of previously unissued common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and conversion of other share-based awards. As of December 31, 2024, 
3.1
 million shares of common stock remained available for future issuance under all plans, subject to adjustment for future stock splits, stock dividends, and similar changes in capitalization.
The majority of share-based compensation expense is reported in our consolidated statements of income as ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses’ with an insignificant amount recorded within ‘Cost of sales.’

not
 have any unrecognized share-based compensation expense related to unvested options. 
Stock options under our equity incentive plans generally expire 
ten years
 after the date of grant.
Restricted Stock Awards and Restricted Stock Units Activity
Generally on an annual basis, we grant RSAs and RSUs. RSAs and RSUs generally vest over 
three years
, depending on the terms of the grant. Holders of unvested RSAs have the same rights as those of common stockholders including voting rights and non-forfeitable dividend rights. However, ownership of unvested RSAs cannot be transferred until vested. Holders of unvested RSUs have a contractual right to receive shares of common stock upon vesting. RSUs have dividend equivalent rights, which accrue over the term of the award and are paid if and when the RSUs vest, but RSU holders have no voting rights. We grant service-condition RSUs, performance-condition RSUs, and market-condition RSUs.
Service-condition RSUs are typically granted on an annual basis and vest over time in 
three
 equal annual installments, beginning one year after the grant date. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we granted 
0.3
 million,  
0.2
 million, and 
0.2
 million service-condition RSUs, respectively. 
F- 29
Table of Contents
Performance-condition RSUs are typically granted on an annual basis and consist of a performance-based and service-based component. The performance targets and vesting conditions for performance-condition RSUs are based on achievement of multiple weighted performance goals. The number of performance-condition RSUs ultimately awarded may be between 
0
% and 
200
%, based on performance. These RSUs vest in 
three
 equal annual installments beginning one year after the grant date, pending certification of performance achievement by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors and continued service. The fair value of performance-condition awards is based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date. Compensation expense, net of forfeitures, is updated for our probable expected performance level against performance goals at the end of each reporting period. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we granted 
0.3
 million, 
0.2
 million, and 
0.3
 million performance-condition RSUs, respectively. We also periodically grant market-condition RSUs to certain executives. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we did 
not
 grant market-conditions RSUs. The grant date fair value and derived service period for market-condition RSUs are estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.

INCOME TAXES 
During the three months ended December 31, 2024, we completed an intra-entity transaction related to certain intellectual property rights primarily to align with current and future international operations. The transaction resulted in a step-up in tax basis of intellectual property rights and a correlated increase in foreign deferred tax assets based on the fair value of the intellectual property righ
ts. Foreign deferred tax assets increased by $
268.8
 million and this benefit was offset by an increase in uncertain tax positions of $
145.6
 million. As such, a net change in deferred tax asset of $
123.2
 million was recognized along with a corresponding foreign income tax benefit. In 2024, we received new information and remeasured the reserve for uncertain tax positions related to the 2020 and 2021 intellectual property rights transactions which resulted in the release of uncertain tax positions of $
141.2
 million along with a corresponding foreign income tax benefit.
During 2020, 2021, and 2023, w
e completed intra-entity transfers of certain intellectual property rights primarily to align with current and future international operations. The transactions were executed using transfer pricing guidelines issued by the relevant taxing authorities. Significant estimates and assumptions were required to compute the valuation of this transaction. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, estimated future revenue growth and discount rates, which by their nature are inherently uncertain, and, therefore, may ultimately differ materially from our actual results.
We have recorded certain tax reserves to address potential differences involving our income tax positions. These potential tax liabilities result from the varying application of statutes, rules, regulations and interpretations by different taxing jurisdictions. While our tax position is not uncertain, because of the significant estimates used in the value of certain intellectual property rights, our tax reserves contain assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about the interpretation of statutes, rules and regulations by taxing jurisdictions. It is possible that the costs of the ultimate tax liability or benefit from these matters may be materially more or less than the amount that we estimated.
In order to support and sustain the amortizable tax basis for these transactions (and associated deferred tax asset, net of uncertain tax position), we must demonstrate economic ownership, including the appropriate authority and expertise to manage the IP owned and serviced in the Netherlands and Singapore. The determination of economic substance is a judgment that has to be evaluated by management on a continual basis requiring understanding and expertise of local laws of each associated tax jurisdiction. The Netherlands and Singapore subsidiaries serve as the primary corporate headquarters outside of the U.S. and already perform significant functions in support of the economic ownership of the IP. In 2024, we undertook many additional activities to align business operations that support the economic substance of the IP.

The intra-entity transaction related to intellectual property rights resulted in an increase in the intangible assets deferred tax asset of $
268.8
 million and this benefit was offset by an increase in uncertain tax positions of $
145.6
 million. I
n 2024, we received new information and remeasured the reserve for uncertain tax positions related to the 2020 and 2021 intellectual property rights transactions which resulted in the release of uncertain tax positions of $
141.2
 million along with a corresponding foreign income tax benefit.
During 2024, valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets increased by $
58.0
 million. The change in the valuation allowance includes an increase of $
58.9
 million related to income tax expense and a decrease of $
0.9
 million that does not impact the tax provision because this amount reflects the cumulative impact of unrecorded tax attributes related to changes in cumulative translation adjustments. During 2023, valuation allowances increased by $
155.4
 million. The change in the valuation allowance includes an increase of $
156.3
 million related to income tax expense and a decrease of $
0.9
 million that does not impact the tax provision because this amount reflects the impact of unrecorded tax attributes related to changes in cumulative translation adjustments. 
Our valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization of tax attributes recorded in various jurisdictions. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have evaluated the realizability of our deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income, including the reversal of existing temporary differences, historical and projected operating results and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In assessing our valuation allowance we considered all available evidence, including the magnitude of recent and current operating results, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our historical experience utilizing tax attributes prior to their expiration dates, the historical volatility of operating results of these jurisdictions and our assessment regarding the sustainability of their profitability. The weight we give to any particular item is, in part, dependent upon the degree to which it can be objectively verified. Separate from the intra-entity transfers of intellectual property rights, we released immaterial valuation allowances in various jurisdictions. 
In certain other jurisdictions, we recorded additional attributes, primarily driven by operational losses recognized based on local tax accounting requirements. These carryforwards were generated in jurisdictions where results indicate it is not more likely than not the deferred tax assets would be realized. We maintain a valuation allowance against the majority of these balances.
We have included in the table above deferred tax assets related to U.S. federal tax carryforwards of foreign tax credits and various state tax credits which expire starting in 2030 of $
17.9
 million and $
3.8
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have included in the table above deferred tax assets related to U.S. state tax net operating loss carryforwards, some of which expire at various dates beginning in 2029 and others of which do not expire, of $
0.3
 million and $
0.3
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have recorded deferred tax assets related to foreign tax carryforwards, including foreign tax credits and net operating losses, which expire starting in 2025 and those which do not expire of $
98.3
 million and $
73.3
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
The transition tax in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) imposed a tax on undistributed and previously untaxed foreign earnings at various tax rates. This tax largely eliminated the differences between the financial reporting and income tax basis of foreign undistributed earnings. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2024, foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. as these amounts are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.

We recorded a net expense of $
50.2
 million related to increases in 2024 unrecognized tax benefits. The impact of uncertain tax benefits on the rate reconciliation includes net increases and decreases in position changes and accrued interest expense.
Any settlements or statute of limitations expirations could result in a significant decrease in our uncertain tax positions. Our assessments are based on estimates and assumptions using the best available information to management. However, our estimates of unrecognized tax benefits and potential tax benefits may not be representative of actual outcomes, and any variation from such estimates could materially affect our financial statements in the period of settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire. Finalizing audits with the relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, and, as a result, it is difficult to estimate the timing and range of possible change related to our uncertain tax positions, and such changes could be significant.
Interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in ‘Income tax expense (benefit)’ in the consolidated statements of income. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we recorded approximately $
4.5
 million, $
3.2
 million, and $
3.8
 million, respectively, of penalties and interest. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we released $
0.2
 million of interest from settlements, lapse of statutes, and change in certainty. The cumulative accrued balance of penalties and interest was $
13.3
 million, $
8.8
 million, and $
5.6
 million, as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
Unrecognized tax benefits of $
591.7
 million, $
562.0
 million, and $
222.5
 million as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, if recognized, would reduce the annual effective tax rate offset by deferred tax assets recorded for uncertain tax positions.
The following table sets forth the tax years subject to examination for the major jurisdictions where we conduct business as of December 31, 2024:
The Netherlands
2012 to 2024
Canada
2016 to 2024

Japan

China
2018 to 2024
Singapore
2019 to 2024
United States
2007 to 2024
U.S. state tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of three to five years after filing of the respective return. The state impact of any federal changes remains subject to examination by various state jurisdictions for a period up to two years after formal notification to the states. As such, U.S. state income tax returns for us are generally subject to examination for the years 2019 to 2024. Although the timing of income tax audit resolutions and negotiations with taxing authorities is highly uncertain, we do not anticipate a significant change in the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

Purchase Commitments
As of December 31, 2024, we had purchase commitments to our third-party manufacturers, primarily for materials and supplies used in the manufacture of our products, for an aggregate of $
301.9
 million. We expect to fulfill our commitments under these agreements in the normal course of business, and as such, no liability has been recorded.
Other
We are regularly subject to, and are currently undergoing, audits by various tax authorities in the U.S. and several foreign jurisdictions, including customs duties, import and other taxes for prior tax years.
During our normal course of business, we may make certain indemnities, commitments, and guarantees under which we may be required to make payments in relation to certain matters. We cannot determine a range of estimated future payments and have not recorded any liability for such payments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
See Note 18 — Legal Proceedings for further details regarding potential loss contingencies related to government tax audits and other current legal proceedings.

OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION 
We have 
two
 reportable operating segments: the Crocs Brand and the HEYDUDE Brand. Each of the reportable operating segments derives its revenues from the sale of footwear and accessories to external customers. 
Additionally, ‘Enterprise corporate’ costs include global corporate costs associated with both brands, including legal, information technology, human resources, and finance.
Each segment’s performance is evaluated based on segment results without allocating Enterprise corporate expenses. Segment profits or losses include adjustments to eliminate inter-segment sales. Reconciling items between segment income from operations and income from operations consist of unallocated enterprise corporate expenses. Our chief operating decision maker is Andrew Rees, Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Rees uses income from operations as a measure of profit or loss. Mr. Rees considers the performance of these measures against management expectations when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources to each segment.
We do not report asset information by segment because that information is not used to evaluate performance or allocate resources between segments.

  In the fourth quarter of 2023, to reflect changes in the way management evaluates performance, makes operating decisions, and allocates resources, we updated our reportable operating segments to be (i) Crocs Brand and (ii) HEYDUDE Brand. Our ‘North America,’ ‘Asia Pacific,’ and ‘EMEALA’ segments as well as revenues and expenses related to Crocs ‘Brand corporate’ have been consolidated to the ‘Crocs Brand.’ As a result of these changes, the previously reported amounts for revenues, income from operations, and depreciation and amortization for the year ended December 31, 2022 have been recast to conform to current period presentation.
(2)
  In November 2023, the FASB issued authoritative guidance related to the segment disclosures. This guidance became effective beginning for the year ended December 31, 2024 and should be applied on a retrospective basis. The guidance requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. As a result of this guidance, we disclosed cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses as measures of significant expenses included within income from operations shown in the table above.
(3)  
In the first quarter of 2024, to reflect a change in the way management evaluates segment performance, makes operating decisions, and allocates resources, we made changes to segment profitability related to certain foreign currency amounts impacting cost of sales. These amounts have shifted costs or benefits that were previously presented in each of our reportable segments to ‘Enterprise corporate.’ We believe that the impact of these changes on prior periods is insignificant to each segment and thus have not recast prior periods.
(4)
  We acquired HEYDUDE on February 17, 2022 and in connection therewith added the HEYDUDE Brand as a new reportable operating segment. Therefore, the amounts shown above for the year ended December 31, 2022 represent results during the partial period beginning on the Acquisition Date through December 31, 2022. 
(5)  
The amounts of depreciation and amortization disclosed by reportable segment and ‘Enterprise corporate’ are included within ‘Cost of sales’ and ‘Selling, general and administrative expenses.’

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
On January 22, 2025, a putative class action lawsuit titled Carretta v. Crocs, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:25-cv-00096, was filed in the District Court for the District of Delaware against the Company and certain of its current officers. The complaint was filed on behalf of a purported class consisting of all purchasers of the Company’s common stock between November 3, 2022 and October 28, 2024, inclusive. The complaint asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 based on allegedly false and misleading statements related to the Company’s wholesaler inventory and its alleged impact on the Company’s revenue. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, an award of costs and expenses, and other unspecified relief. The Company and its officers intend to vigorously defend this action in all respects. The case is in its early stages and a lead plaintiff has yet to be appointed. The Company is not in a position to assess the likelihood of any potential loss or adverse effect on its financial condition or to estimate the amount or range of potential loss, if any, from this action at this time.
For all other legal claims and disputes, we have accrued estimated losses of $
2.7
 million within ‘Accrued expenses and other liabilities’ in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. As we are able, we estimate reasonably possible losses or a range of reasonably possible losses. As of December 31, 2024, we estimated that reasonably possible losses associated with these legal claims and other disputes could potentially exceed amounts accrued by an insignificant amount.
Although we are subject to other litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including employment, intellectual property, and product liability claims, other than as set forth above, we are not party to any other pending legal proceedings that we believe would reasonably have a material adverse impact on our business, financial results, and cash flows.
