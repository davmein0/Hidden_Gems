We own a single-story industrial building of approximately 31,000 square feet in Sunnyvale, California, which we have leased on a long-term basis to a corporate tenant, which has occupied the building since June 2016. The initial term of the lease agreement expired on May 31, 2024 and was extended for an additional eighty-four months, commencing June 1, 2024 and ending May 31, 2031.

All other domestic and foreign facilities are leased from third-party lessors on arms’ length terms. We believe our owned and leased facilities are adequate for our foreseeable needs.
