MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

A discussion regarding our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, was included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, on pages 27-29 under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, which was filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024.

We design, develop, manufacture, and market modular power components and power systems for converting electrical power for use in electrically-powered devices. Our competitive position is supported by innovations in product design and achievements in product performance, largely enabled by our focus on the research and development of advanced technologies and processes, often implemented in proprietary semiconductor circuitry, materials, and packaging. Many of our products incorporate patented or proprietary implementations of high-frequency switching topologies enabling power system solutions that are more efficient and much smaller than conventional alternatives. Our strategy emphasizes demonstrable product differentiation and a value proposition based on competitively superior solution performance, advantageous design flexibility, and a compelling total cost of ownership. While we offer a wide range of alternating current (“AC”) and direct current (“DC”) power conversion products, we consider our core competencies to be associated with 48V DC distribution, which offers numerous inherent cost and performance advantages over lower distribution voltages. However, we also offer products addressing other DC voltage standards (e.g., 380V for power distribution in data centers, 110V for rail applications, 28V for military and avionics applications, and 24V for industrial automation).

Based on design, performance, and form factor considerations, as well as the range of evolving applications for which our products are appropriate, we categorize our product portfolios as either “Advanced Products” or “Brick Products.” The Advanced Products category consists of our more recently introduced products, which are largely used to implement our proprietary Factorized Power Architecture™ (“FPA”), an innovative power distribution architecture enabling flexible, rapid power system design using individual components optimized to perform a specific conversion function.

The Brick Products category largely consists of our broad and well-established families of integrated power converters, incorporating multiple conversion stages, used in conventional power systems architectures. Given the growth profiles of the markets we serve with our Advanced Products line and our Brick Products line, our strategy involves a continuing transition in organizational focus, emphasizing investment in our Advanced Products line and targeting high growth market segments with a low-mix, high-volume operational model, while maintaining a profitable business in the mature market segments we serve with our Brick Products line with a high-mix, low-volume operational model.

The applications in which our Advanced Products and Brick Products are used are typically in the higher-performance, higher-power segments of the market segments we serve. With our Advanced Products, we generally serve large Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”), Original Design Manufacturers (“ODMs”), and their contract manufacturers, with sales currently concentrated in the data center and hyperscaler segments of enterprise computing, in which our products are used for power delivery on server motherboards, in server racks, and across datacenter infrastructure. We have established a leadership position in the emerging market segment for powering high-performance processors used for acceleration of applications associated with artificial intelligence (“AI”). Our customers in the AI market segment include the leading innovators in processor and accelerator design, as well as early adopters in cloud computing and high performance computing. We also serve applications in aerospace and aviation, defense electronics, satellites, factory automation, instrumentation, test equipment, transportation, telecommunications and networking infrastructure, and vehicles (notably in the autonomous driving, electric vehicle, and hybrid vehicle niches of the vehicle segment). With our Brick Products, we generally serve a fragmented base of large and small customers, concentrated in aerospace and defense electronics, industrial equipment, instrumentation and test equipment, and transportation (notably in rail and heavy equipment applications). With our strategic emphasis on larger, high-volume customers, we expect to experience over time a greater concentration of sales, including from intellectual property licensing among relatively fewer customers.

Our quarterly consolidated operating results can be difficult to forecast and have been subject to significant fluctuations. We plan our production and inventory levels based on management’s estimates of customer demand, customer forecasts, and other information sources. Customer forecasts, particularly those of OEM, ODM, and contract manufacturing customers to which we supply Advanced Products in high volumes, are subject to scheduling changes on short notice, contributing to operating inefficiencies and excess costs. In addition, external factors such as supply chain uncertainties, which are often associated with the cyclicality of the electronics industry, regional macroeconomic and trade-related circumstances, and force majeure events (most recently evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic), have caused our operating results to vary meaningfully. Supply chain disruptions, including those associated with our reliance on outsourced package

process steps that are essential in the production of some of our Advanced Products, and those relating, for example, to the procurement of raw material, have in the past negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact our operating results. We have taken steps to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions by, among other things and in varying degrees, moving outsourced manufacturing steps in-house to the Company, ordering supplies with extended lead times, paying higher prices for certain supplies or outsourced production, and expediting deliveries at a cost premium. The resulting impact of the steps taken to mitigate supply chain disruptions have, to varying degrees and at different times, reduced our revenue, gross margin, operating profit and cash flow and may continue to do so in the future.  Our quarterly gross margin as a percentage of net revenues may vary, depending on production volumes, licensing income, average selling prices, average unit costs, the mix of products sold during that quarter, and the level of importation of raw materials subject to tariffs. Our quarterly operating margin as a percentage of net revenues also may vary with changes in revenue and product level profitability, but our operating costs are largely associated with compensation and related employee costs, which are not subject to sudden or significant changes.

2024 Financial Highlights

•
Net revenues decreased 11.4% to $359,058,000 for 2024, from $405,059,000 for 2023. Net revenues for Advanced Products for 2024 decreased compared to 2023, primarily due to continued softness in underpenetrated markets, partially offset by increased royalty revenue associated with intellectual property licensing. The decrease in net revenues for Brick Products was primarily due to reduced market demand. 

•
Export sales, as a percentage of total revenues, represented approximately 48.2% in 2024 and 63.1% in 2023.

•
Gross margin decreased to $183,998,000 for 2024, from $204,929,000 for 2023. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenues increased to 51.2% for 2024 from 50.6% for 2023. The decrease in gross margin dollars was primarily the result of lower sales volume in 2024, with the increase in gross margin percentage primarily attributable to higher royalty revenue and improved production efficiencies compared to 2023 along with certain reductions in supply chain costs.

•
Backlog, representing the total of orders received for products for which shipment is scheduled within the next 12 months, was approximately $155,505,000 at the end of 2024, as compared to $160,805,000 at the end of 2023. 

•
Operating expenses for 2024 increased $31,737,000, or 20.7%, to $185,308,000 from $153,571,000 for 2023. Litigation-contingency expense was $19,500,000 for 2024, which related to the litigation with SynQor, Inc. ("SynQor"), as compared to $0 for 2023. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the SynQor litigation-contingency expense.

•
We reported net income for 2024 of $6,129,000, or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to net income of $53,595,000, or $1.19 per diluted share, for 2023.  

•
In 2024, as a result of a full year of activities in our expanded manufacturing facility and the related capital equipment being placed in service during the year, depreciation and amortization totaled $18,626,000, and capital expenditures were $23,602,000, compared to $17,240,000 and $33,452,000, respectively, for 2023. 

•
Inventories decreased by approximately $547,000, or 0.5%, to $106,032,000 at the end of 2024, as compared to $106,579,000 at the end of 2023.

The following table sets forth certain items of selected consolidated financial information as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.  This table and the subsequent discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

24

Table of Contents

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”).  The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, and our associated judgments, including those related to inventories, income taxes, contingencies, and litigation.  We base our estimates, assumptions, and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and on various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  We also have other policies we consider key accounting policies (See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements – 
Significant Accounting Policies –Impact of recently issued accounting standards
). However, the application of these other policies does not require us to make significant estimates and assumptions difficult to support quantitatively.

Inventories

We employ a variety of methodologies to evaluate inventory that is estimated to be excess, obsolete or unmarketable, in order to write down that inventory to net realizable value. Our estimation process for assessing net realizable value is based upon forecasted future usage which we derive based on backlog, historical consumption, and expected market conditions. For both our Brick and Advanced Product lines, the methodology used compares on-hand quantities to forecasted usage and historical consumption, such that amounts of inventory on hand in excess of management’s estimate of expected future utility, are fully reserved. While we have used our best efforts and believe we have used the best available information to estimate future demand, due to uncertainty in the economy and our business and the inherent difficulty in forecasting future usage, it is possible actual demand for our products will differ from our estimates. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory reserves for existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods.

Evaluation of the Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets

Significant management judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part.  We assess the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis.  We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and past financial performance.  Despite recent positive operating results, we face uncertainties in forecasting our operating results due to the unpredictability of customer orders in certain markets, product transitions, new program introductions and adoption times of new technology offerings.  This operating uncertainty also makes it difficult to predict the availability and utilization of tax benefits over the next several years. As a result, management has concluded, as of December 31, 2024, it is more likely than not our net domestic deferred tax assets will not be realized, and a full valuation allowance against all net domestic deferred tax assets is still warranted as of December 31, 2024.   The valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets may require adjustment in the future based on changes in the mix of temporary differences, changes in tax laws, and operating performance. If the positive operating results continue, and our concerns about the unpredictability of customer orders in certain markets, product transitions, new program introductions and adoption times of new technology offerings are resolved, and we believe future taxable income can be more reliably forecasted, we may release all or a portion of the valuation allowance in the near-term. Certain state tax credits, though, will likely never be released by the valuation allowance. If and when we determine the valuation allowance should be released (i.e., reduced), the adjustment would result in a tax benefit reported in that period’s Consolidated Statements of Operations, the effect of which would be an increase in reported net income.

The amount of any such tax benefit associated with release of our valuation allowance in a particular quarter may be material.

New Accounting Pronouncements

From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) that we adopt as of the specified effective date.  Unless otherwise discussed, we believe the impact of recently issued accounting standards will not have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations.  See Note 2 – 
Significant Accounting Policies
 – 
Impact of recently issued accounting standards
, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements, including the dates of adoption and expected impact on our financial position and results of operations.

Other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after December 31, 2024 are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Year ended December 31, 2024 compared to Year ended December 31, 2023

Consolidated net revenues for 2024 were $359,058,000, a decrease of $46,001,000, or 11.4%, as compared to $405,059,000 for 2023.

The decrease in net revenues for Advanced Products was primarily due to continued softness in underpenetrated markets, partially offset by increased royalty revenue. The decrease in net revenues for Brick Products was primarily due to reduced market demand.

Gross margin for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 decreased $20,931,000, or 10.2%, to $183,998,000 from $204,929,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenues, increased to 51.2% for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2024, as compared to 50.6% for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in gross margin dollars was primarily the result of lower sales volume in 2024, with the increase in gross margin percentage primarily attributable to higher royalty revenue and improved production efficiencies compared to 2023 along with certain reductions in supply chain costs, including a reduction of $1,958,000 in outsourced manufacturing costs partially offset by incremental costs of bringing production in-house for certain Advanced Products, offset by slightly unfavorable sales mix and an increase in freight-in and tariff spending of $953,000 (net of approximately $1,669,000 in duty drawback recovery in 2024 and $6,954,000 in duty drawback recovery in 2023 of previously paid tariffs).

Selling, general, and administrative expenses were $96,886,000 for 2024, an increase of $11,172,000, or 13.0%, as compared to $85,714,000 for 2023.  As a percentage of net revenues, selling, general, and administrative expenses increased to 27.0% in 2024 from 21.2% in 2023.

Our exposure to market risk fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates to the operations of Vicor Japan Company, Ltd. ("VJCL"), for which the functional currency is the Japanese Yen, and all other subsidiaries in Europe and Asia, for which the functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. These subsidiaries in Europe and Asia experienced more unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in 2024 compared to 2023. In 2024, interest income increased due to higher balances of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company.

Income before income taxes was $10,487,000 in 2024, as compared to $60,244,000 in 2023.

The effective tax rates differ from the statutory tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 primarily due to the Company’s full valuation allowance position against net domestic deferred tax assets. The provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 included estimated federal, state, and foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which the Company does not have sufficient tax attributes.

The Company's tax expense and the rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 continues to be negatively impacted by the capitalization of research and development expenses under Section 174 in the U.S., which given the Company's performance, is having an outsized impact on the rate by increasing the taxable income position, which causes a significant tax expense. This is further compounded by the Company not getting a deferred tax benefit from temporary differences due to the full valuation allowance on net domestic deferred tax assets.

See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure regarding our current assessment of the valuation allowance against all net domestic deferred tax assets, and the possible release (i.e., reduction) of the allowance in the future.

We reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 of $6,129,000, or $0.14 per diluted share, as compared to $53,595,000, or $1.19 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

At December 31, 2024, we had $277,273,000 in cash and cash equivalents.  The ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 7.5:1 at December 31, 2024, as compared to 9.5:1 at December 31, 2023.  Net working capital increased $25,017,000 to $401,214,000 at December 31, 2024 from $376,197,000 at December 31, 2023.

In November 2000, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $30,000,000 of our Common Stock (the “November 2000 Plan”). In July 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100,000,000 of our Common Stock (the “New Repurchase Authorization”). The New Repurchase Authorization replaces the November 2000 Plan in its entirety and no further repurchases will be made pursuant to the November 2000 Plan. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $99,503,000 remaining available for repurchases of our Common Stock under the New Repurchase Authorization. The timing and amounts of Common Stock repurchases under the New Repurchase Authorization are at the discretion of the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer based upon economic and financial market conditions.

As of December 31, 2024, we had a total of approximately $12,669,000 of cancelable and non-cancelable capital expenditure commitments, principally for manufacturing and production equipment, which we intend to fund with existing cash, and approximately $1,946,000 of capital expenditure items and internal-use software which had been received and included in Property, plant and equipment in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, but not yet paid for. Our primary needs for liquidity are for making continuing investments in manufacturing and production equipment. We believe cash generated from operations together with our available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund planned operational needs and capital equipment purchases for the foreseeable future.

We do not consider the impact of inflation and changing prices on our business activities or fluctuations in the exchange rates for foreign currency transactions to have been significant during the last three fiscal years.

Item 7A.  
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  As our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments consist principally of cash accounts, money market securities and U.S. Treasury securities, which are short-term in nature, we believe our exposure to market risk on interest rate fluctuations for these investments is not significant. As of December 31, 2024, our long-term investment portfolio, recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as “Long-term investment, net”, consisted of a single auction rate security with a par value of $3,000,000, purchased through and held in custody by a broker-dealer affiliate of Bank of America, N.A., that has experienced failed auctions (the “Failed Auction Security”) since February 2008.  While the Failed Auction Security is Aaa/AA+ rated by major credit rating agencies, collateralized by student loans and guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education under the Federal Family Education Loan Program, continued failure to sell at its periodic auction dates (i.e., reset dates) could negatively impact the carrying value of the investment, in turn leading to impairment charges in future periods.  Periodic changes in the fair value of the Failed Auction Security attributable to credit loss (i.e., risk of the issuer’s default) are recorded through earnings as a component of “Other income (expense), net”, with the remainder of any periodic change in fair value not related to credit loss (i.e., temporary “mark-to-market” carrying value adjustments) recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)”, a component of Vicor Corporation Stockholders’ Equity.  Should we conclude a decline in

29

Table of Contents

the fair value of the Failed Auction Security is other than temporary, such losses would be recorded through earnings as a component of “Other income (expense), net”.  We do not believe there was an “other-than-temporary” decline in value in this security as of December 31, 2024.

We estimate our annual interest income would change by approximately $30,000 in 2024 for each 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates.

Our exposure to market risk for fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the operations of VJCL, for which the functional currency is the Japanese Yen, and changes in the relative value of the Yen to the U.S. Dollar.  Relative to our Yen exposure as of December 31, 2024, we estimate a 10% unfavorable movement in the value of the Yen relative to the U.S. Dollar would increase our foreign currency loss by approximately $49,000. The functional currency of all other subsidiaries in Europe and other subsidiaries in Asia is the U.S. Dollar. While we believe risk to fluctuations in foreign currency rates for these subsidiaries is generally not significant, they can be subject to substantial currency changes, and therefore foreign exchange exposures.

Report of Independent R

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors

Vicor Corporation:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Vicor Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in Item 15(a)(2) (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Realizability of raw materials inventory

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company values inventories at the lower of cost, determined using the first-in, first-out method, or net realizable value. The Company’s estimation process for assessing net realizable value is based upon expected future utility, which was derived based on backlog, historical consumption and expected market conditions. As disclosed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements approximately 74% or $78.9 million, of the Company’s total inventory balance is comprised of raw materials.

We identified the evaluation of the realizability of certain raw materials inventory to be a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required as a result of uncertainty in market conditions used to estimate forecasted future usage and

32

Table of Contents

the long lead times to acquire raw materials within the global electronics supply chain. Changes in forecasted future usage could have a significant impact on the realizability of raw materials inventory.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the Company’s process to develop its forecast of usage, including estimates of the projected demand based on historical usage and the potential impact of market conditions. We evaluated the Company’s estimate of the realizability of raw materials by:

•
assessing historical consumption as a predictor of future product demand by comparing it to trends in industry publications

•
examining the historical accuracy of the Company’s prior estimates by considering subsequent usage and write off activity

•
evaluating the adjustments made to forecast future demand based on historical usage data

•
interviewing operational personnel of the Company involved in purchasing and manufacturing to evaluate product innovations, changes in customer mix, and other factors that may impact expected future sales and usage of raw material inventory.

Realizability of domestic deferred tax assets

As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company had a valuation allowance of $61.5 million against domestic deferred tax assets, net of deferred tax liabilities, for which realization cannot be considered more likely than not. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers all positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and past financial performance.

We identified the evaluation of the realizability of the domestic deferred tax assets as a critical audit matter due to subjectivity involved in assessing the recoverability of those deferred tax assets. Subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the uncertainty inherent in estimating the Company’s ability to generate sufficient domestic taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences of the appropriate character in the future.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s income tax process, including a control related to the assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets and the application of relevant tax regulations. To assess the Company’s ability to forecast its financial performance used to determine future domestic taxable income, we compared the Company’s previous forecasts to actual results, and evaluated the Company’s consideration of the customer orders as well as the impact of industry and global economic conditions through inquiry with operational personnel and inspection of third-party publications. We involved federal income tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the Company’s application of relevant tax regulations and evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets.

The deferred tax assets associated with cumulative foreign currency translation losses and cumulative unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities are completely offset by a tax valuation allowance as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. Therefore, there is 
no
 income tax benefit (provision) recognized in any of the three years ended December 31, 2024.

VICOR CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.
DESCRIPTIO
N OF BUSINESS
Vicor Corporation (the “Company” or “Vicor”) designs, develops, manufactures, and markets modular power components and power systems for converting electrical power. The Company also licenses certain rights to its technology in return for recurring royalties. The principal markets for the Company’s power converters and systems are large original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), original design manufacturers (“ODMs”) and their contract manufacturers, and smaller, lower volume users, which are broadly distributed across several major market areas.

2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of consolidation
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.

Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates and assumptions relate to the useful lives of fixed assets and identified intangible assets, recoverability of long-lived assets, fair value of short-term and long-term investments, allowances for doubtful accounts, potential excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventory, potential reserves relating to litigation matters, accrued liabilities, accrued taxes, deferred tax valuation allowances, assumptions pertaining to share-based payments, and other reserves. Actual results could differ from those based on these estimates and assumptions, and such differences may be material to the financial statements.
Foreign currency translation
The financial statements of Vicor Japan Company, Ltd. ("VJCL"), a majority-owned subsidiary, for which the functional currency is the Japanese Yen, have been translated into U.S. Dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date for balance sheet amounts and the average exchange rates in effect during the year for income statement amounts. The gains and losses resulting from the changes in exchange rates from year to year have been reported in other comprehensive income.
Transaction gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is the U.S. Dollar are included in other income (expense), net. Foreign currency losses included in other income (expense), net were approximately $(
622,000
), $(
161,000
), and $(
653,000
) in 
2024, 2023, and 2022
, respectively.
Investments
The Company’s principal sources of liquidity are its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and cash generated from operations. Consistent with the guidelines of the Company’s investment policy, the Company can invest, and has historically invested, its cash balances in demand deposit accounts, money market funds, government debt securities, and auction rate securities meeting certain quality criteria.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and maturities of 90 days or less at the time of acquisition.  Cash and cash equivalents include funds held in disbursement (i.e., checking) and money market accounts, certificates of deposit, and debt securities with maturities of 
less than three months
 at the time of purchase. Cash and cash equivalents are valued at cost, approximating market value. The Company’s money market securities are purchased and redeemed at par value. Their estimated fair value is equal to their cost, and, due to the nature of the securities and their classification as cash equivalents, there are no unrealized gains or losses recorded at the balance sheet dates.

VICOR CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Short-term Investments
The Company’s short-term investments, consisting of obligations of the U.S. Treasury, are debt securities with original maturities greater than three months but less than one year at the time of purchase.
Long-term Investment

The Company’s long-term investment is an auction rate debt security with a maturity of greater than one year and is subject to credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risk.
Available-For-Sale Securities
Certain of the cash and cash equivalents, all of the short-term investments and the long-term investment are classified as available-for-sale securities (“AFS”).   These securities are recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, attributable to credit loss recorded through the Consolidated Statement of Operations and unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, attributable to other non-credit factors recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” a component of Total Equity. Given the nature of the cash and cash equivalents and the short-term investments designated as AFS, credit losses are not considered to be material.  In determining the amount of credit loss for the long-term investment, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected to the amortized cost basis of the security, considering credit default risk probabilities and changes in credit ratings, among other factors.

The Company periodically evaluates the long-term investment to determine if impairment is required, whether an impairment is other than temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. The Company considers a variety of impairment indicators such as, but not limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, or asset quality of the investment.
The amortized cost of the debt securities are adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, the net amount of which, along with interest and realized gains and losses, is included in “Other income (expense), net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Fair value measurements
The Company accounts for certain financial assets at fair value, defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. A three-level hierarchy is used to show the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair value measurements:

Level 1

Inputs used to measure fair value are unadjusted quoted prices available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.

Level 2

Inputs used to measure fair value, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in inactive markets. Level 2 also includes assets and liabilities valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data from actively quoted markets for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3

Inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management’s estimates of market participant assumptions.

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short maturities of these financial instruments.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (determined using the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. Fixed production overhead is allocated to the inventory cost per unit based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. Abnormal production costs, including fixed cost variances from normal production capacity, if any, are charged to cost of product revenues in the period incurred. All shipping and handling costs incurred in connection with the sale of products are included in cost of product revenues.
Inventory estimated to be excess, obsolete, or unmarketable is written down to net realizable value. The Company’s estimation process for assessing net realizable value is based upon management’s estimate of expected future utility which is derived based on backlog, historical consumption and expected market conditions. If the Company’s estimated demand and/or market expectations were to change or if product sales were to decline, the Company’s estimation process may cause larger inventory reserves to be recorded, resulting in larger charges to cost of product revenues.

Government Grants

The Company accounts for government assistance that is not subject to the scope of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 740, Income Taxes using a grant accounting model, by analogy to International Accounting Standards 20, 
Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance
, and recognize such grants when we have reasonable assurance that we will comply with the grant’s conditions and that the grant will be received. Government grants whose primary condition is the purchase, construction, or acquisition of a long-lived asset are considered asset-based grants and are recognized as a reduction to such asset’s cost basis, which reduces future depreciation. Other government grants not related to long-lived assets are considered income-based grants, which are initially recognized as “Government grants receivable” and are also recognized as a reduction to the related cost of activities that generated the benefit. Proceeds received from asset based grants are presented as cash inflows from investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows, whereas proceeds received from income based grants are presented as cash inflows from operating activities.
Concentrations of risk
Financial instruments potentially subjecting the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which a significant portion are held by three financial institutions, its long-term investment, and trade accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and certain other financial instruments with high credit counterparties, and continuously monitors the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and diversifies its investments in order to minimize its credit risk. Generally, amounts invested with these financial institutions are in excess of federal deposit insurance limits.  The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts, and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk.  The Company’s long-term investment as of December 31, 2024
 consists of a single auction rate security with a par value of $
3,000,000
, which is collateralized by student loans. It is a highly rated (Aaa/AA+) municipal and corporate debt security. Through 
December 31, 2024, auctions held for the Company’s auction rate security have failed. The funds associated with an auction rate security that has failed auction may not be accessible until a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, the security is called, or the underlying securities have matured. If the credit rating of the issuer of the auction rate security held deteriorates, the Company may be required to adjust the carrying value of the investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value through an impairment charge. The Company’s investment policy, approved by the Board of Directors, limits the amount the Company may invest in any issuer, thereby reducing credit risk concentrations.
The Company’s products are sold worldwide to customers ranging from smaller, independent manufacturers of highly specialized electronic devices, to larger OEMs, ODMs and their contract manufacturers.  The Company’s Brick Products’ customers are primarily concentrated in the following industries: aerospace and defense electronics, industrial equipment, instrumentation and test equipment, and transportation (notably in rail and heavy equipment applications). The Company’s  Advanced Products’ customers are concentrated in the data center and hyperscaler segments of enterprise computing, in which the Company’s products are used for power delivery on server motherboards, in server racks, and across datacenter infrastructure. The Company also serves applications in aerospace and aviation, defense electronics, satellites, factory automation, instrumentation, test equipment, transportation, telecommunications and networking infrastructure, and vehicles (notably in the autonomous driving, electric vehicle, and hybrid vehicle niches of the vehicle segment).  While, overall, the Company has a broad customer base and sells into a variety of industries, a substantial portion of the Company’s revenue from its Advanced Products line has been derived from a limited number of customers.  This concentration of revenue is a

41

Table of Contents

VICOR CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

reflection of the relatively early stage of adoption of the technologies, architectures and products offered in the Advanced Products line, and the Company’s strategy of targeting market leading innovators as initial customers for its Advanced Products.   Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the number of entities comprising the Company’s customer base. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, 
one
 customer accounted for approximately 
11.5
% and 
12.0
%, respectively, of trade account receivables.

Components and materials used in the Company’s products are purchased from a variety of vendors.  While most of the components are available from multiple sources, some key components for certain Advanced Products, in particular, are supplied by single vendors.  In instances of single source items, the Company maintains levels of inventories management considers appropriate to enable meeting the delivery requirements of customers.  If suppliers or subcontractors cannot provide their products or services on time or to the required specifications, the Company may not be able to meet the demand for its products and its delivery times may be negatively affected.
Long-lived assets
The Company reviews property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.  Management determines whether the carrying value of an asset or asset group is recoverable based on comparison to the undiscounted expected future cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives.  If an asset value is not recoverable, the impairment loss is equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined by either a quoted market price, if any, or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique.  Evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows.  Actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long-lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets.   These differences could result in impairment charges, which could be material.
Intangible assets
Patents
Values assigned to patents are amortized using the straight-line method over periods ranging from 
three
 to 
20
 years.  Patents and other intangible assets are included in “Other assets” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Internally Developed Software
We capitalize internal and external costs related to developing, modifying or obtaining software for internal use, incurred during the application development stage in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 350-40, 
Internal-Use Software
. Costs related to software upgrades and enhancements are capitalized if it is determined that these upgrades or enhancements provide additional functionality to the software. The capitalized software is amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software. As of December 31, 2024
 and 2023, we had $
20,469,000
 and $
11,712,000
, respectively, of capitalized internal-use software costs which have not been amortized as the software has not yet been placed in service.
Product warranties
The Company generally offers a two-year warranty for all of its products, though it has extended the warranty period to three years for certain products. The Company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors influencing the Company’s warranty reserves include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty returns, and the cost per return. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of warranty reserves and adjusts the amounts as necessary. Warranty obligations are included in "Accrued expenses" in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Revenue recognition

Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Sales, value add, and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue producing activities are excluded from revenue. The expected costs associated

42

Table of Contents

VICOR CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

with product warranties continue to be recognized at the time product revenue is recognized. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of product revenues.
The Company’s primary source of net revenue comes from the sale of products, which are modular power components and power systems for converting, regulating and controlling electric current. The principal customers for the Company’s power converters and systems are large OEMs, ODMs and the original design manufacturers and contract manufacturers serving them, and smaller, lower volume users, which are broadly distributed across several major market areas. The Company recognizes revenue for product sales at a point in time following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, including sales to stocking distributors, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery, depending on the terms of the underlying contract.  The Company establishes sales allowances on shipments to stocking distributors for estimated future product returns including distributor returns and price adjustment credits, primarily based upon historical and anticipated rates of product returns and allowances.
Certain contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations, which typically may include a combination of non-recurring engineering services (“NRE”), prototype units, and production units. For these contracts, the individual performance obligations are accounted for separately if they are distinct. Generally, the Company has determined the NRE and prototype units represent one distinct performance obligation and the production units represent a separate distinct performance obligation. For such arrangements, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, based on prices charged to customers or using the expected cost plus a margin approach. The Company recognizes revenue for NRE and prototype units at the point in time at which the final milestone under the NRE arrangement is completed and control is transferred to the customer, which is generally the shipment or delivery of the prototype. Revenue for production units is recognized upon shipment or delivery, consistent with product revenue summarized above.
The Company licenses its intellectual property under right to use licenses, in which royalties due to the Company are based upon a percentage of the licensee’s sales. The Company utilizes the exception under the revenue recognition guidance for the recognition of sales- or usage-based royalties, in which the royalties are not recognized until the later of when 1) the customer’s subsequent sales or usages occur, or 2) the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales- or usage-based royalty has been allocated is satisfied or partially satisfied.
Accounts receivable includes amounts billed and currently due from customers. The amounts due are stated at their estimated realizable value. The Company’s payment terms vary by the type and location of its customers and the products or services offered, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 
30
 to 
60
 days. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments, based on assessments of customers’ credit-risk profiles and payment histories. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The Company does not require collateral from its customers, although there have been circumstances when the Company has required cash in advance (i.e., a partial down-payment) to facilitate orders in excess of a customer’s established credit limit. To date, such amounts have not been material.
The Company records deferred revenue, which represents a contract liability, when cash payments are received or due in advance of performance under a contract with a customer. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Company recognized revenue of approximately $
1,865,000
 and $
7,568,000
, respectively, which was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the respective period.

The Company applies the practical expedient for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract for sales commissions, which are expensed when incurred because the amortization period is generally less than one year. These costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
The Company also applies another practical expedient and does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.
Advertising expense
The cost of advertising is expensed as incurred. The Company incurred approximately $
3,490,000
, $
3,730,000
, 
and

43

Table of Contents

VICOR CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

$
3,786,000
 in advertising costs during 
2024, 2023, and 2022
, respectively.
Legal Costs
Legal costs in connection with litigation are expensed as incurred.

Stock-based compensation
The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock option awards, whether they possess time-based vesting provisions or performance-based vesting provisions, and awards granted under the Vicor Corporation 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), as of their grant date. For stock options with time-based vesting provisions, the calculated compensation expense, net of expected forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally 
five years
 for stock options.  For stock options with performance-based vesting provisions, recognition of compensation expense, net of expected forfeitures, commences if and when the achievement of the performance criteria is deemed probable.  For stock options with performance-based vesting provisions, compensation expense, net of expected forfeitures, when recognized, is recognized over the relevant performance period.

Income taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted income tax rates and laws expected to be in effect when the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if management determines it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  All deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent.

The Company follows a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to recognize. The first step is to evaluate the tax position to determine the likelihood it would be sustained upon examination by a tax authority. If the tax position is deemed “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained, the second step is to assess the tax position to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that possesses greater than 
50
 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If the tax position does not meet the “more-likely-than-not” threshold, then it is not recognized in the financial statements. Additionally, the Company accrues interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest and penalties, if any, are included in “Long-term income taxes payable” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Net income per common share
The Company computes basic net income per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and diluted net income per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of outstanding dilutive stock options, if any.  
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for the years ended December 31 (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Impact of recently issued accounting standards

On November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, which enhances segment disclosures and requires additional disclosures of segment expenses. This ASU is effective for annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods thereafter. The Company 
adopted
 ASU 2023-07 during the year ended December 31, 2024 on a retrospective basis. See Note 10 Segment Information to the consolidated financial statements.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
, which focuses on the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU No. 2023-09 requires a public business entity ("PBE") to disclose, on an annual basis, a tabular rate reconciliation using both percentages and currency amounts, broken out into specified categories with certain reconciling items further broken out by nature and jurisdiction to the extent those items exceed a specified threshold. In addition, all entities are required to disclose income taxes paid, net of refunds received disaggregated by federal, state/local, and foreign and by jurisdiction if the amount is at least 5% of total income tax payments, net of refunds received. For PBEs, the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. An entity may apply the amendments in this ASU prospectively by providing the revised disclosures for the period ending December 31, 2025 and continuing to provide the pre-ASU disclosures for the prior periods, or may apply the amendments retrospectively by providing the revised disclosures for all period presented. The Company expects this ASU to impact disclosures with no impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
, requiring public entities to disclose additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to the financial statements on an interim and annual basis. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2024-03.
Other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after December 31, 2024 are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

INVESTMENTS
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the Company held one auction rate security with a par value of $
3,000,000
 and an estimated fair value of approximately $
2,641,000
 and $
2,530,000
, respectively, purchased through and held in custody by a broker-dealer affiliate of Bank of America, N.A., that has experienced failed auctions (the “Failed Auction Security”) since February 2008. The Failed Auction Security held by the Company is Aaa/AA+ rated by major credit rating agencies, is collateralized by student loans, and is guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. Management is not aware of any reason to believe the issuer of the Failed Auction Security is presently at risk of default. Through 
December 31, 2024
, the Company has continued to receive interest payments on the Failed Auction Security in accordance with the terms of its indenture. Management believes the Company ultimately should be able to liquidate the Failed Auction Security without significant loss primarily due to the overall quality of the issue held and the collateral securing the substantial majority of the underlying obligation.  Changes in the estimated fair value of the Failed Auction Security have not been significant in the past three years.  However, current conditions in the auction rate securities market have led management to conclude the recovery period for the Failed Auction Security 
exceeds 12 months
. As a result, the Company continued to classify the Failed Auction Security as long-term as of 
December 31, 2024.
At this time, the Company has no intent to sell the Failed Auction Security and does not believe it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security. If current market conditions deteriorate further, the Company may be required to record additional unrealized losses. If the credit rating of the security deteriorates, the Company may be required to adjust the carrying value of the investment through impairment charges recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, and any such impairment adjustments may be material.

The Company accounts for certain financial assets at fair value, defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.  A three-level hierarchy is used to show the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair value measurements.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis included the following as of

On August 9, 2022, Congress enacted a 
25
 percent tax credit for investment in semiconductor manufacturing to incentivize domestic semiconductor production. The Advanced Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit ("ITC") was enacted as part of the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors Act in response to supply chain disruptions.

The Company had undergone a study of its 2024 and 2023 capital expenditures to determine which additions would qualify under the ITC guidance and which would not. The Company believes that it does comply with the grant conditions supported by the study and that the grant will be received based on meeting these conditions.

The Company recorded in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 an Other current asset for the associated value of the ITC credit receivable of $
6,274,000

 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Vicor currently grants options for the purchase of Common Stock (i.e., “stock options”) under the following equity compensation plans that are stockholder-approved:
Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the “2000 Plan”)
  — Under the 2000 Plan, the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors may grant stock incentive awards based on the Company’s Common Stock, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares, unrestricted stock, deferred stock, and dividend equivalent rights.  Awards may be granted to employees and other key persons, including non-employee directors.  Incentive stock options may be granted to employees at a price at least equal to the fair market value per share of the Common Stock on the date of grant, and non-qualified options may be granted to non-employee directors at a price at least equal to 
85
% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant.  A total of 
10,000,000
 shares of Common Stock have been reserved for issuance under the 2000 Plan.  The period of time during which an option may be exercised and the vesting periods are determined by the Compensation Committee.  The term of each option may not exceed 
10
 years from the date of grant and have a vesting period of 
five years
.
Vicor Corporation 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Plan” or the “ESPP”)
. Under the ESPP, the Company has reserved 
2,000,000
 shares of Common Stock for issuance to eligible employees who elect to participate.  The ESPP is intended to qualify as an “employee stock purchase plan” under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The ESPP operates in successive periods of approximately 
six months
, each referred to as an “offering period.” Generally, offering periods commence on or around September 1 and March 1 and end on or around the following February 28 or August 31, respectively. Under the ESPP, an option is granted to participating employees on the first day of an offering period to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock at the end of that offering period at a purchase price equal to 
85
% of the lesser of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on either the first day or the last day of that offering period.  The purchase of shares is funded by means of periodic payroll deductions, which may not exceed 
15.0
% of the employee’s eligible compensation, as defined in the Plan. Among other provisions, the Plan limits the number of shares that can be purchased by a participant during any offering period and cumulatively for any calendar year.

All time-based (i.e., non-performance-based) options for the purchase of Vicor common stock are granted with an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price for Vicor Common Stock at the date of the grant. 
The fair value for non-performance-based stock options awarded under the 2000 Plan for the years shown below was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

4.4

Risk-free interest rate:
The Company uses the yield on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury “Strip” securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption for each vesting period.

Expected dividend yield:
The Company determines the expected dividend yield by annualizing the most recent prior cash dividends declared by the Company’s Board of Directors, if any, and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of that dividend declaration. Dividends are not paid on options.

Expected volatility:
Vicor uses historical volatility to estimate the grant-date fair value of the options, using the expected term for the period over which to calculate the volatility (see below). The Company does not expect its future volatility to differ from its historical volatility. The computation of the Company’s volatility is based on a simple average calculation of monthly volatilities over the expected term.
Expected term:
The Company uses historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the Black-Scholes grant-date valuation. The Company believes this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of options, and all groups of the Company’s employees exhibit similar exercise behavior.

Forfeiture rate:

The amount of stock-based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards

Table of Contents

VICOR CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

that are ultimately expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option. The forfeiture analysis is re-evaluated annually and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary.  Ultimately, the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest.
Based on an analysis of historical forfeitures, the Company applied an annual forfeiture rate of 
4.30
% in 2024, estimating approximately 
88
% of its options would actually vest.  For 2023 and 2022, the Company applied an annual forfeiture rate of 
5.00
% and 
5.35
%, respectively, estimating approximately 
86
% and 
85
%, respectively, of its options would actually vest.

, the Company had options exercisable for 
973,894
 and 
1,046,092

, $
17,957,000
, and $
15,087,000
, respectively.

As of December 31, 2024
, there was approximately $
26,273,000
 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards for Vicor. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of

7,537,000
 in 2026, $
3,911,000

 LEASES
All of the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases.  The majority of the Company’s leases are for office and manufacturing space, along with several automobiles and certain equipment. Leases with initial terms of less than twelve months are not recorded on the balance sheet.  Expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  The Company’s leases have remaining terms of less than 
one year
 to just over 
11 years
.  The majority of the Company’s leases do not have options to renew, although several have renewal terms to extend the lease for one five-year term, and one lease contains two five-year renewal options.  None of the renewal options are included in determining the term of the lease, used for calculating the associated lease liabilities. None of the Company’s leases include variable payments, residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.   A number of the Company’s leases for office and manufacturing space include provisions for common area maintenance (“CAM”). The Company accounts for CAM separately from lease payments, and therefore costs for CAM are not included in the determination of lease liabilities. The Company is a party to one arrangement as the lessor, for its facility located in Sunnyvale, California, with a third party. 
The initial term of the lease agreement expired on 
May 31, 2024
 and was extended for an additional 
eighty-four months
, commencing 
June 1, 2024
 and ending 
May 31, 2031
.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, the balance of right of use (“
ROU
”) assets was approximately $
6,367,000
 and $
7,390,000
, respectively. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the balances of short-term and long-term lease liabilities were approximately $
1,716,000
 and $
5,620,000
, respectively.  As of 
December 31, 2023
, the balances of short-term and long-term lease liabilities were approximately $
1,864,000
 and $
6,364,000
, respectively.  For the year ended 
December 31, 2024
, the Company recorded operating lease cost, including short-term lease cost, of approximately $
2,108,000
 ($
2,138,000
 in 2023).  The ROU assets are included in “Property, plant and equipment, net” in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of December 31, 2024

 against 
all net domestic deferred tax assets, for which realization cannot be considered more likely than not at this time.  Management

assesses 
the need for the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers all positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and past financial performance. Despite recent positive operating results, the Company faces uncertainties in forecasting its operating results due to the unpredictability of customer orders in certain markets, product transitions, new program introductions and adoption times of new technology offerings . This operating uncertainty also makes it difficult to predict the availability and utilization of tax benefits over the next several years. As a result, management has concluded, as of December 31, 2024, it is more likely than not the Company’s net domestic deferred tax assets will not be realized, and a full valuation allowance against all net domestic deferred tax assets is still warranted as of December 31, 2024. The valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets may require adjustment in the future based on changes in the mix of temporary differences, changes in tax laws, and operating performance. If the positive operating results continue, the Company’s concerns about industry uncertainty, product transitions, new program introductions and adoption times of new technology offerings are resolved, and the Company believes future taxable income can be more reliably forecasted, the Company may release all or a portion of the valuation allowance in the near-term. Certain state tax credits, though, will likely never be released by the valuation allowance. If and when the Company determines the valuation allowance should be released (i.e., reduced), the adjustment would result in a tax benefit reported in that period’s Consolidated Statements of Operations, the effect of which would be an increase in reported net income.
As of December 31, 2024
, the Company had 
no
 federal net operating loss carryforwards available, and had state net operating losses of approximately $
4,000
, which will begin to expire in 
2030
. The Company has federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $
12,344,000
 and $
21,892,000
, which will begin to expire in 
2039
 and

The Company has reviewed the tax positions taken, or to be taken, in its tax returns for all tax years currently open to examination by a taxing authority.  The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, that is the aggregate tax effect of differences between tax return positions and the benefits recognized in the Company’s financial statements, as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 of $

3,474,000
, respectively, if recognized, may decrease the Company’s income tax provision and effective tax rate.  None of the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024 are expected to significantly change during the next twelve months.

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.  During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recognized approximately $
36,000
, $
23,000
, and $
17,000
, respectively, in net interest expense.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had accrued approximately $
52,000
 and $
67,000
, respectively, for the potential payment of interest.

The Company files income tax returns in the United States and various foreign tax jurisdictions. These tax returns are generally open to examination by the relevant tax authorities from three to seven years from the date they are filed. The tax filings relating to the Company’s federal and state taxes are currently open to examination for tax years 2021 through 2023 and 2020 through 2023, respectively. In addition, the Company generated federal research and development credits in tax years 2005 through 2020. These years may also be subject to examination when the credits are carried forward and utilized in future years.

The Company was informed in September 2021 by the Internal Revenue Service of their intention to examine the Company’s 2019 Federal income tax return.  The IRS has closed the examination of the 2019 tax year with no material adjustments. There are no other audits or examinations in process in any other jurisdiction.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has not provided deferred U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences resulting from unremitted earnings for non-U.S. subsidiaries, which were not significant, and were permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. Upon repatriation of those earnings, in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company could be subject to immaterial withholding taxes payable to the various foreign countries.

 COMMITMENTS AND contingencies
At December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately 
$
12,669,000
 of cancelable and non-cancelable capital expenditure commitments, principally for manufacturing equipment.
As previously reported in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K, the Company is the defendant in a patent infringement lawsuit originally filed on January 28, 2011 by SynQor, Inc. (“SynQor”) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “District Court”). SynQor alleged that certain Vicor products infringed certain United States Patents owned by SynQor.

On October 26, 2022, after a trial in the District Court, the jury returned a verdict finding that the Company willfully infringed one SynQor patent, and awarding SynQor damages in the amount of $
6,500,000
.

On May 20, 2024, the District Court issued an Amended Corrected Final Judgment, awarding SynQor actual damages of $
6,500,000
, enhanced damages of $
4,500,000
, costs in the amount of approximately $
87,000
, attorney fees in the amount of $
9,500,000
, and pre-judgment interest of approximately $
5,400,000
, for a total judgment of approximately $
26,000,000
. In addition, the District Court ordered that post-judgment interest would accrue at an amount of $
2,323
 per day starting on April 24, 2024 until the judgment is paid, compounded annually, and that additional post-judgment interest in the amount of $
1,351
 per day would accrue starting on May 20, 2024 until the judgment is paid, compounded annually.

On May 22, 2024, the Company filed an appeal of the District Court’s judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. That appeal remains pending.

In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company recorded a litigation related accrual of $
6,500,000
 in the third quarter of 2022 and incremental litigation related accruals of $
17,200,000
 in the first quarter of 2024 and $
2,300,000
 in the second quarter of 2024 when the Amended Corrected Final Judgment was issued, for a total of $
26,000,000
, as its estimate based on the awarded judgments, including enhanced damages, pre-judgment interest, costs and attorney fees. The final determination of the litigation related accrual amount will be subject to appeal and could differ from the recorded liability.

Consistent with the court order, post-judgment interest will accrue on the pre-judgment amount until paid and the Company has recorded post judgment interest of approximately $
992,000
 for the year ended December 31, 2024, within the Selling, general and administrative expenses on the Statement of Operations and the associated Accrued litigation account.

On July 11, 2024, purported stockholders of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California styled Pouladian et al. v. Vicor Corporation et al., case number 3:24-cv-04196. The suit was brought against the Company and the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman (the "Defendants"). The plaintiffs allege violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), due to allegedly false and misleading statements during earnings calls in 2023 about the Company’s commercial relationship with an existing customer. The complaint seeks damages, interest and attorneys’ fees and costs. The plaintiffs were appointed lead plaintiffs on October 24, 2024, and an amended complaint was filed on November 22, 2024. The Defendants filed their motion to dismiss the amended complaint on January 1, 2025. The plaintiffs’ response is due March 5, 2025, and the Defendants have until March 21, 2025 to file their reply. The Defendants believe the plaintiffs’ claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.

On July 25, 2024, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts styled Valiquette v. Vicor Corporation et al., case number 1:24-cv-11935. The suit was brought against the Company; the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman; the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Secretary and Director; and the Company’s Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing and Director. The plaintiffs alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, due to allegedly false and

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

misleading statements during earnings calls in 2023 about the Company’s commercial relationship with an existing customer. The complaint sought damages, interest and attorneys' fees and costs. On September 24, 2024, the class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts was voluntarily dismissed, without prejudice.

In addition, the Company is involved in certain other litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of its business, both as a defendant and a plaintiff. While the outcome of such other lawsuits and claims against the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not expect such litigation or claims will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations.

ITEM 9A. 
Controls and procedures

Attached as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K are certifications of our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), which are required in accordance with Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act. This “Controls and Procedures” section includes information concerning the controls and controls evaluation referred to in the certifications.

(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures

As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, conducted an evaluation regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the last fiscal year. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We recognize any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and we necessarily apply our judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  Based on the evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, the CEO and CFO concluded, as of such date, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

(b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures: (a) pertaining to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (b) providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and Board of Directors; and (c) providing reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

Management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, the end of our fiscal year. Management based its assessment on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Management’s assessment included evaluation of such elements as the design and operating effectiveness of key financial reporting controls, process documentation, accounting policies, and our overall control environment.

Based on our assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included immediately below.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Vicor Corporation:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Vicor Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in Item 15(a)(2) (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

(c) Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

The Company’s management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

(d) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
