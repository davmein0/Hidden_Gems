BUSINESS OVERVIEW AND TRENDS 
General
​
We are a leading Bitcoin mining company focused on utilizing our vertical integration strategy to mine Bitcoin in support of the Bitcoin blockchain. We own and operate multiple Bitcoin mining sites in the United States with two locations in Texas, consisting of the Rockdale Facility and the Corsicana Facility, and the Kentucky Facility. The Rockdale Facility is believed to be the largest Bitcoin mining facility in North America, as measured by developed capacity, and currently provides 700 MW in total developed capacity. Additionally, we are developing our second large-scale Bitcoin mining facility, the Corsicana Facility, which currently provides 400 MW in developed capacity. Upon completion, the Corsicana Facility is expected to have approximately one GW of capacity available. During 2024, we capitalized on our positioning within the market and acquired Block Mining, a Kentucky-based vertically-integrated Bitcoin miner and E4A Solutions, a leading provider of electrical engineering services to a diverse customer base of energy developers and data center operators. The Block Mining Acquisition added 60 MW of operational capacity for self-mining operations, which we are working to expand to 110 MW in 2025, and provided us with access to a secondary electrical grid. The acquisition of E4A Solutions adds engineering expertise to service our own existing and future electrical infrastructure, as well as provides solutions and services to the rapidly growing market for electrical infrastructure. 
​
Our market environment is highly competitive globally and regionally. We compete against other large-scale Bitcoin miners and individuals to receive the Bitcoin reward that is the heart of our operations. Our industry frequently evolves based on the proliferation of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, and we believe we are well positioned in the digital commodities industry in which we operate. 
We are organized in two business segments: Bitcoin Mining and Engineering.

​
Bitcoin Mining
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we continued development activities at the Corsicana Facility, acquired the Kentucky Facility and deployed miners at all our Facilities, with the objective of increasing our operational efficiency and performance in the future. As of December 31, 2024, we had a total deployed hash rate capacity of 31.5 EH/s, as compared to 12.4 EH/s as of December 31, 2023, an increase of 154.0%. 
​
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we mined 4,828 Bitcoin, as compared to 6,626 Bitcoin mined during the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease of 1,798 Bitcoin was primarily due to the April 2024 halving event, which was partially offset by our increase in deployed hash rate.
​
We are targeting a total self-mining hash rate capacity of 38.4 EH/s by the end of 2025.

Custodians
​
As Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency, it is not required that Bitcoin be held by a custodian, and we may elect to self-custody. However, we believe our private keys relating to our Bitcoin are better safeguarded by the secure environment provided by custodians. Self-custody poses an increased risk to our private keys and we may not have the same level of protection as custody providers who are well versed in industry best practices to protect digital assets from potential theft, loss, or destruction.
​
Pursuant to the Digital Asset Custodial Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2023, between us and NYDIG (as may be amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the “NYDIG Custodial Agreement”), NYDIG, a well-known U.S.-based third-party digital asset-focused custodian, holds our Bitcoin in cold storage wallets in a digital asset account in our name. In exchange for its custodial services, NYDIG charges an annual fee equal to a percentage of our custodied Bitcoin based on the daily average value in U.S. dollars of the Bitcoin we custody with NYDIG. Our Bitcoin held in such digital asset accounts does not constitute “deposits” within the meaning of U.S. federal or state banking law and the digital asset accounts are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections. The cold storage wallets in which our Bitcoin is held with NYDIG are all located in the United States. The NYDIG Custodial Agreement is for a term of one-year, and automatically renews for successive one-year periods, unless either the Company or NYDIG provides thirty days’ notice of termination, in writing, except that either the Company or NYDIG may terminate the NYDIG Custodial Agreement in writing, effective immediately, in the event that either NYDIG or the Company are adjudged bankrupt or insolvent or files an application for an arrangement with its creditors, or there is a material misstatement or failure of a party to perform its obligations under the NYDIG Custodial Agreement, a change in applicable law that has a material adverse effect on the services provided for in the NYDIG Custodial Agreement, or a substantial change in ownership or control or material adverse change in the financial condition of NYDIG or the Company.
​
The NYDIG Custodial Agreement contains certain mutual indemnification provisions, including that NYDIG will indemnify us against direct claims for loss of custodied assets that arise directly from NYDIG’s or NYDIG’s nominees’ grossly negligent action, grossly negligent failure to act, bad faith or willful misconduct. Additionally, the Company shall indemnify NYDIG against all claims and liabilities incurred or assessed against NYDIG in connection with the NYDIG Custodial Agreement, except as may arise from certain of NYDIG or its nominees’ own actions or conduct.
​
For more information on the NYDIG Custodial Agreement, see the full text of the NYDIG Custodial Agreement filed herewith as Exhibit 10.22, which qualifies the forgoing descriptions of the NYDIG Custodial Agreement in its entirety.
​
We are also a party to a Digital Asset Execution Agreement with NYDIG Execution LLC (“NYDIG Execution”), pursuant to which NYDIG Execution executes or arranges transactions of our Bitcoin (“Orders”) as our agent. NYDIG Execution earns a commission on each trade determined by the net trade proceeds in U.S. dollars. NYDIG Execution does not charge us additional fees for principal trades. We deliver our Orders to NYDIG Execution via a designated security procedure, and each Order is affirmatively accepted by NYDIG Execution. While our Bitcoin may temporarily be processed through a NYDIG Execution customer account, NYDIG has covenanted that our assets will not be commingled with the assets of NYDIG Execution. NYDIG Execution is required to deposit any cash from the sale of our Bitcoin into our bank account at a U.S. depositary institution, less any applicable commissions. NYDIG Execution does not guarantee the value of our Bitcoin and is not responsible for any delay or failure to complete any Order caused by a digital asset network. If NYDIG Execution fails to (1) execute a properly executable Order and (2) give us notice of such failure, NYDIG Execution will only be liable for our actual damages.
​
The Company also engaged Coinbase, a well-known U.S.-based third-party digital asset-focused custodian through the Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement, which includes the Coinbase Custody Services Agreement, and the Coinbase Master Trading Agreement (together, the “Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement”) for custodial and prime broker services, including, but not limited to, the storing of digital assets, trade execution, lending, post-trade credit, and other services. In exchange for its custodial services, Coinbase charges an initial storage fee and an annualized custodial service fee based on the total value of the digital assets the Company custodies with Coinbase. Our Bitcoin held in such digital asset accounts does not constitute “deposits” within the meaning of U.S. federal or state banking law and the digital asset accounts are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections. The cold storage wallets in which our Bitcoin is held with Coinbase are located in the United States.
​
The Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated by Coinbase or the Company for any reason upon providing thirty days written notice to the other party. However, Coinbase may, in its sole discretion, suspend, restrict or terminate the Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement, including by suspending, restricting or closing the Company’s accounts or any provision of credit (as applicable), immediately upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement), without prior notice to the Company.
​
37

Table of Contents
The Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement contains certain mutual indemnification provisions, including that Coinbase will indemnify the Company from and against direct claims and losses arising out of or relating to any (i) violation, misappropriation, or infringement upon any United States patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property right of a third party or (ii) violation of applicable law, unless such claims or losses arise out of or relate to the Company’s gross negligence, fraud, willful misconduct, or breach of the Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement. The Company will indemnify Coinbase from and against any and all third-party claims and losses arising out of or relating to the Company’s breach of the Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement, the Company’s violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or rights of any third party, or the Company’s gross negligence, fraud, or willful misconduct, except to the extent such third-party claims and losses resulted from the gross negligence, fraud or willful misconduct of Coinbase.
​
Additionally, under the Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement, Coinbase may execute or arrange transactions of our Bitcoin as our agent. The Company will pay a fixed rate as commission and transaction fees associated with the Order executed. The Company delivers Orders to Coinbase, and Coinbase executes Orders by using automated trade routing services or by filling Orders on Coinbase’s over-the-counter trading service. Coinbase may accept or reject any Order, at its sole discretion. Coinbase does not guarantee the value of our Bitcoin and is not responsible for any delay or failure to complete any Order caused by a digital asset network. 
​
For more information on the Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement, see the full text of the Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement included herein as Exhibit 10.23, which qualifies the forgoing description
s
 of the Coinbase Prime Broker Agreement in its entirety.
​
Our custodian and brokerage services relationships are non-exclusive, and we may change our Bitcoin custodian and brokerage relationships at any time. We continually monitor our Bitcoin assets held by our Custodians, and in the case of NYDIG we have unlimited audit rights with respect to such custodial accounts. The Company performs monthly reconciliations of our Bitcoin assets held by our custodian(s) and the records of our mining pool, and our independent auditors verify the location and quantity of our Bitcoin assets annually, as part of the year-end audit process of our financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting. The Company’s insurance providers do not have inspection rights associated with our Bitcoin assets held in cold storage.

(1)
Hash rate, deployed, represents the total potential hash rate of all our deployed miners as of the end of the period, whereas hash rate, average operating, represents the average total hash rate our deployed miners provided throughout the period. The difference between deployed hash rate and operating hash rate is attributable to down time of all or some of miners for power curtailments, or repairs and maintenance of Bitcoin miners or supporting infrastructure. The difference between deployed and operating hash rate is a key measure in determining the efficiency of our Bitcoin Mining operations. 
​
(2)
All-in power cost is the price we paid throughout the period for our power, net of power curtailments received. Power is overwhelmingly the largest marginal input cost in mining Bitcoin and a significant contributor to profitability. Miners with a low cost of power  are also able to profitability mine in a wider range of Bitcoin price.
​
(3)
Developed power is the total amount of electricity our Facilities can utilize for Bitcoin Mining as of the end of the period.

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we paid cash of approximately $342.4 million, $247.7 million, and $195.1 million, respectively, in total deposits and payments for the purchase of miners. Costs to finance the purchase of miners were zero as the miners were paid for with cash from our cash balance. The seller did not provide any financing, nor did we borrow from a third-party to purchase the miners. We do not have any current plans to finance miners we may purchase in the future.
​
(3)
Power curtailment credits are credited against our power invoices as a result of temporarily pausing our operations to participate in ERCOT’s Demand Response Service Programs. Our fixed-price power purchase contracts enable us to strategically curtail our mining operations and participate in these programs, which significantly lower our cost to mine Bitcoin. These credits are recognized in 
Power curtailment credits
 on our Consolidated Statements of Operations, outside of cost of revenue, but significantly reduce our overall cost to mine Bitcoin.
​

We capitalize the acquisition cost of our miners and include these costs in 
Property and equipment, net
 on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The miners are depreciated over an estimated useful life of three years, during which time, the miners are expected to generate Bitcoin revenue. We do not consider depreciation expense in determining whether it is economical to

operate our miners since depreciation is a non-cash expense and is not a variable operating cost that can be avoided even if we curtail operations temporarily. Depreciation expense incurred is disclosed for each respective period in the table above.

Computed as revenue recognized from Bitcoin mined divided by the quantity of Bitcoin mined during the same period.
​
During 2023, we entered into purchase orders under the Master Agreement to acquire new immersion miners from MicroBT. These purchase orders represented a total hash rate of 25.6 EH/s, for a total purchase price of approximately $453.4 million, subject to downward price adjustment as provided by the Master Agreement. These miners are primarily for use at the Corsicana Facility, which commenced operations in April 2024. Delivery of these miners began in 2023 and all miners are expected to be received and deployed by mid-2025. The Master Agreement provides us with four additional annual options to purchase miners, on the same or more favorable terms as the second purchase order executed under the Master Agreement. These additional miners represent a total hash rate of approximately 75.0 EH/s, assuming exercise of all four annual purchase options.
​
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we executed an additional purchase order with MicroBT under the Master Agreement to acquire new air-cooled miners with a total hash rate of 5.9 EH/s, for a total purchase price of approximately $96.7 million. This purchase order is in addition to the four additional purchase options remaining under the Master Agreement. Delivery of these miners occurred in the third quarter of 2024, and deployment commenced upon delivery.
​
For the year ended December 31, 2024, Bitcoin Mining revenue was approximately $321.0 million.

Data Center Hosting
​
In 2023, we made the decision to stop pursuing new hosting contracts and end our legacy contracts, to focus on our self-mining efforts. During the year ended December 31, 2024, all agreements with Data Center Hosting customers were terminated, and we have no plans to offer data center hosting services to new customers. We no longer report Data Center Hosting as a separate reportable segment.
​
Engineering
Our Engineering business designs and manufactures power distribution equipment and custom engineered electrical products. The products allow us to vertically-integrate many critical electrical components and engineering services necessary for our site developments and to reduce our execution and counter-party risk in ongoing and future expansion projects. The specialized talent employed in our Engineering business allows us the opportunity to explore new methods to optimize and develop best-in-class Bitcoin Mining operations and have been instrumental in the development of our industrial-scale immersion-cooled Bitcoin mining hardware.
Our Engineering business also provides electricity distribution product design, manufacturing, and installation services primarily focused on large-scale commercial and governmental customers and serves a broad scope of clients across a wide range of markets including data center, power generation, utility, water, industrial, and alternative energy.  
Engineering revenue is derived from the sale of custom products built to customers’ specifications under fixed-price contracts with one identified performance obligation. Engineering revenue is recognized over time as performance creates or enhances an asset with no alternative use, and for which we have an enforceable right to receive compensation as defined under the contract.
In December 2024, we acquired E4A Solutions, a leading provider of electrical engineering services to a diverse customer base of energy developers and data center operators (the “E4A Solutions Acquisition”). This acquisition adds to our vertically integrated strategy by adding engineering expertise to service its own existing and future electrical infrastructure as well as provide solutions and services to the rapidly growing market for electrical infrastructure. 
​
For the year ended December 31, 2024, Engineering revenue was approximately $38.5 million.
Strategic Goals and Initiatives
Bitcoin Treasury Strategy
Our Bitcoin acquisition strategy involves mining Bitcoin utilizing vertical integration, and from time to time, subject to market conditions, purchasing Bitcoin with our liquid assets derived from issuing debt or equity securities. Our vertical integration strategy has supported our stability during market fluctuations and allows us to capitalize on industry consolidation while building on our liquidity position. 
We view our Bitcoin holdings as long-term holdings, and during the year ended December 31, 2024, made the strategic decision to halt the sale of Bitcoin, and instead increase our Bitcoin holdings. 
​
Power Strategy
Long-term power contracts form the basis of our power strategy. We utilize our Power Purchase Agreements (“PPA”) in place at the Rockdale Facility (the “Rockdale PPA”) and Kentucky Facility (the “Kentucky PPA”) in the following ways:
Manual Curtailment
We power down operations and return power to the utility when market prices for electricity provide the potential for us to receive more power curtailment credits than the Bitcoin Mining revenues we would have generated had we not curtailed our mining operations. We receive power credits for the difference in the market power price and our fixed power price, which provides us the ability to maximize our overall profitability between Bitcoin Mining and supporting the grid by not drawing power from the grid when electricity is most scarce.

Table of Contents
Ancillary Services
We competitively bid to sell ERCOT and MISO the option to control our electrical load during certain hours. ERCOT and MISO compensate us in the form of Demand Response Credits, which are received whether or not we are called on to power down.
ERCOT’s 4CP Program
At the Rockdale Facility, we voluntarily power down operations during times of peak demand in summer months. Participation provides us substantial savings on transmission costs in the subsequent year’s power bills, reducing our overall power costs.

Challenges, Risks, and Industry Trends
Increased Competition and Network Difficulty
The price of Bitcoin increased during the first quarter of 2024 due to a new source of demand, the eleven Bitcoin spot ETFs, which were approved to begin trading by the SEC on January 11, 2024. The ETFs, as investment vehicles, provide a new access point for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin through more traditional markets.
During 2023 and 2024, the Bitcoin mining industry saw record growth as the price of Bitcoin increased from the lows experienced in early 2023. The increasing Bitcoin price renewed opportunities to access capital markets to fund growth, leading to unprecedented expansion in mining operations and resulting in a doubling in the size of provisioned hash calculation services on the network, as measured by total hash rate. Many Bitcoin mining companies heavily invested in implementing vertically-integrated business models, infrastructure, and upgrading and expanding mining fleets in advance of the April 2024 Bitcoin network halving. Competition on the Bitcoin network has expanded in kind and we expect competition within the mining industry to continue as long as Bitcoin prices remain elevated or increase further.
We have observed that when the market price for Bitcoin experiences a sustained increase (as it did across 2024), new miners are introduced onto the Bitcoin network, increasing its network difficulty. Despite increasing our hash rate by approximately 154.0% from December 31, 2023, to December 31, 2024, the halving in April 2024 and increased network difficulty following increased network hash rate across the periods resulted in a decrease of approximately 27.1% in the number of Bitcoin we mined in 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023.    
Accordingly, as network difficulty continues to increase, existing miners will need to increase their hash rate to maintain and improve their chances of earning a Bitcoin mining reward. To do this, we seek out new Bitcoin mining capacity, including through our acquisition and development of new Bitcoin mining facilities (such as the Corsicana Facility and the Block Mining Acquisition) and electricity supply and distribution facilities to service them, as well as other strategic growth opportunities. Further, we have adopted new and improved technology to increase both our mining power and efficiency, including our industrial-scale adoption of immersion cooling and our strategic acquisitions of large quantities of the newest and most powerful and efficient miners available.
Increased Transaction Fees 
The Bitcoin mining industry recently experienced an increase in transaction fees on the Bitcoin network, as well as an increase in overall demand for Bitcoin. Various protocols on the Bitcoin network gained popularity during 2023, and at times temporarily resulted in a significant increase in the transaction fees paid to add a certain Bitcoin transaction to the blockchain. These transaction fees are volatile in nature but are paid directly to miners and are representative of public interest in transacting in Bitcoin. Transaction fees are packaged with the block subsidy issued by the Bitcoin network to combine for the total reward paid to miners upon solving a block.
We have led the industry by focusing on a vertically-integrated business model since 2021. We continue to focus on building long-term stockholder value by taking strategic actions to further vertically-integrate our business at the current Rockdale Facility, developing the Corsicana Facility, and having acquired the Kentucky Facility and E4A Solutions. Management believes a focus on vertical integration will positively affect each of our business segments by providing increased capacity for our Bitcoin Mining operations, more opportunities for implementing our proprietary power strategy, and by positioning us to capitalize on supply chain efficiencies and electrical engineering services garnered through our Engineering segment. We continue to focus on deploying our efficient Bitcoin mining fleet, at scale, while realizing the benefits of being an owner and operator of our Bitcoin Mining facilities.
Grid Curtailment
​
The PUCT, ERCOT, and Oncor collectively oversee the regulatory, administrative, and delivery aspects of our power supply in Texas; MISO oversees our power supply in Kentucky. In recent years, regulatory scrutiny on Bitcoin mining facilities and their energy consumption has intensified as the industry has grown.
​
As the grid operator, ERCOT is responsible for monitoring and testing market participants, including our Bitcoin mining facilities in Rockdale and Corsicana, to evaluate their impact on grid reliability. During this process, ERCOT may issue curtailment notices to reduce the power usage at our Texas operations. We are periodically tested and monitored, and have experienced curtailment of power based on instructions we receive from Oncor and ERCOT. Due to the uncertainties regarding the duration or extent of power curtailments and testing procedures, we are currently unable to reasonably estimate any potential impacts to our business. If we 
43

Table of Contents
cannot secure adequate access to electrical power, we may be forced to reduce or shut down our operations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.
​
See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report for additional discussion regarding potential impacts our competitive and evolving industry may have on our business.
​
Recent Events Affecting the Company
For the year ended December 31, 2024, we continued to experience an inflationary environment and global supply chain logistics issues across all channels of distribution. We have experienced delays in certain of our miner delivery schedules and in our infrastructure development schedules due to constraints on globalized supply chains for miners, electricity distribution equipment, and construction materials. We have also experienced delays in our Engineering business segment’s manufacturing and delivery schedule, and in our infrastructure development schedules, resulting from constraints on the globalized supply chains for miners, electricity distribution equipment and construction materials.
​
Through the date of this Annual Report, we have been able to effectively and efficiently mitigate delivery delays to avoid materially impacting our miner deployment schedule, however, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to mitigate any such delivery delays in the future. Additionally, the development and potential expansions of our Facilities require large quantities of construction materials, specialized electricity distribution equipment, and other component parts that are in high demand and can be difficult to source. To help mitigate the impacts of global supply chain constraints and increasing demand for these goods, including any inflationary pricing concerns that may result, we have procured and already hold many of the electrical infrastructure components and materials required for development of the next 600 MW phase of our development of the Corsicana Facility, as well as replacement components and parts for our existing systems, to help shorten the impact of potential damage to installed equipment.
​
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Results of Operations Comparative Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023
Revenue
Our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, was $376.7 million and $280.7 million, respectively, and consisted of Bitcoin Mining revenue, Engineering revenue, and Other revenue. Other revenue consists almost entirely of residual activity related to our ceased Data Center Hosting segment.
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, Bitcoin Mining revenue was $321.0 million and $189.0 million, respectively. The increase of $132.0 million was primarily due to an increase in price of Bitcoin in the 2024 period, which averaged 
$66,488
 per Bitcoin, as compared to 
$28,523
 per Bitcoin for the 2023 period, partially offset by decreased production resulting from the increase in the Bitcoin network difficulty and the April 2024 halving. 
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, Engineering revenue was $38.5 million and $64.3 million, respectively. 
The decrease of $25.8 million was primarily attributable to supply chain constraints resulting in decreased receipts of materials, delaying the completion of certain custom products, and therefore, the recognition of revenue. Our custom electrical products are used as important components in data center development and in power generation and distribution facilities. There continues to be significant demand for these products due to the escalated interest in data center construction, as well as the growing worldwide demand for power.

 are individually not material. 
This increase of approximately $92.6 million was primarily due to the increase in Bitcoin Mining capacity at the Rockdale Facility and commencement of Bitcoin Mining activities at the Corsicana Facility, both of which require additional headcount and direct costs necessary to maintain and support our expanded Bitcoin Mining operations, as well as the absorption of other costs previously included in our former Data Center Hosting segment. Cost of revenue for Bitcoin Mining excludes depreciation and amortization, which are stated separately on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
​
Cost of revenue for Engineering for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $41.7 million and $60.6 million, respectively. The costs consisted primarily of direct materials and labor, as well as indirect manufacturing costs. Consistent with the causes of decreased Engineering revenue noted above, the decrease of approximately $18.9 million was primarily due to decreased receipts of materials resulting from increased competition for direct materials due to supply chain constraints. 
​
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, totaled $266.9 million and $100.3 million, respectively. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of stock-based compensation, legal and professional fees, and other personnel and related costs. 
The increase of approximately $166.6 million was primarily due to increases in stock compensation expenses of $93.0 million, which was primarily due to new grants under our long-term incentive program, compensation expenses of $22.8 million as a result of hiring additional employees to support our ongoing growth, legal and professional fees of $29.4 million primarily related to ongoing litigation, public company compliance, and ongoing due diligence, and $21.2 million for additional insurance and other costs primarily attributable to ongoing growth. 
Depreciation and amortization expense during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 totaled $212.1 million and $252.4 million, respectively, a decrease of $40.3 million. The decrease was primarily due to the change in the estimated lives of our Bitcoin miners from 2 years to 3 years, partially offset by increased depreciation from the Corsicana Facility coming online in April 2024 and additional miners being deployed.
The changes in fair value of Bitcoin for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were gains of $457.4 million and $184.7 million, respectively, and were recognized to adjust the fair value of our Bitcoin held at the end of each period.  
The changes in fair value of our derivative asset for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were gains of $45.3 million and $6.7 million, respectively, and
 were recorded to adjust the fair values of the Rockdale PPA and 25 MW Power Purchase Agreement in place at the Corsicana Facility (“Corsicana PPA”), which are classified as a derivative assets and measured at fair value. The changes in fair value were primarily due to changes in future power prices over the applicable period. 
The gain incurred during the year ended December 31, 2024, was primarily attributable to the average of the forward prices utilized in the discounted cash flow estimation models increasing from $45.15 per megawatt hours (“mWh”) as of December 31, 2023, to $51.70 per mWh as of December 31, 2024. 
Power curtailment credits during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $33.7 million and $71.2 million, respectively, 
and represent sales of unused power under the Rockdale PPA and the Kentucky PPA and participation in ancillary services under ERCOT and MISO Demand Response Services Programs. The amount of these credits varies from period to period depending on various factors impacting the supply of power to, and the demand for power on, the power grids, such as weather and global fuel costs

Non-GAAP Measures
In addition to financial measures presented under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), we consistently evaluate our use of and calculation of non-GAAP financial measures such as “Adjusted EBITDA.” EBITDA is computed as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure defined as EBITDA adjusted to eliminate the effects of certain non-cash and/or non-recurring items that do not reflect our ongoing strategic business operations, which management believes results in a performance measurement that represents a key indicator of our core business operations of Bitcoin mining. The adjustments include fair value adjustments such as derivative power contract adjustments, equity securities value changes, and non-cash stock-based compensation expense, in addition to financing and legacy business income and expense items.

We believe Adjusted EBITDA can be an important financial measure because it allows management, investors, and our Board to evaluate and compare our operating results, including our return on capital and operating efficiencies, from period-to-period by making such adjustments. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is used as a performance metric in our share-based compensation plan.  

Adjusted EBITDA is provided in addition to, and should not be considered to be a substitute for, or superior to, net income, the most comparable measure under GAAP to Adjusted EBITDA. Further, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to revenue growth, net income, diluted earnings per share or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this financial measure either in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We generate non-cash revenue through mining Bitcoin at our Facilities, which we retain based on our Bitcoin Treasury Strategy, while financing operations and other expenses with cash typically raised through the issuance of our common stock under our ATM offering program. Additionally, in the year ended December 31, 2024, we used nearly all of our cash proceeds from our 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030, to acquire Bitcoin. During the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we issued and sold approximately 90.6 million shares and 62.2 million shares, respectively, of our common stock under our ATM offering program for aggregate net proceeds (net of sales commissions and expenses) of $956.6 million and $761.8 million, respectively. 
As of December 31, 2024, our net working capital totaled approximately $439.1 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $277.9 million, and marketable securities of $134.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we reported net income of $109.4 million, which included $395.7 million in non-cash net gains, primarily consisting of revenue recognized from Bitcoin mined of $321.0 million, $457.4 million in change in fair value of Bitcoin, and the change in fair value of the derivative asset of $45.3 million, partially offset by depreciation and amortization of $212.1 million, stock-based compensation of $125.2 million, and the unrealized loss on marketable securities of $69.5 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold 212 Bitcoin for proceeds of approximately $9.5 million. Subsequent to those sales, we made the strategic decision to temporarily halt the sale of all our Bitcoin production and instead, increase our Bitcoin holdings. We monitor our balance sheet on an ongoing basis and evaluate the level of Bitcoin retained from monthly production in consideration of our cash requirements for ongoing operations and expansion. 
Contractual Commitments and Obligations
As of December 31, 2024, we had a remaining commitment of approximately $1.0 million due to MicroBT for the contractual purchase of miners, which was paid in full in January 2025.

Development of the Corsicana Facility 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we announced our planned development of the Corsicana Facility, our second large-scale Bitcoin Mining facility located on a 265-acre site in Navarro County, Texas. The Corsicana Facility is expected, upon completion, to have 1.0 GW of developed capacity, with an additional 200 MW of electrical capacity available for development, at our discretion, which is securely supplied with power by a substation being developed for us on the premises that will be interconnected with the nearby Navarro Switch. The strategic decision to locate the Corsicana Facility next to the Navarro Switch was made to limit electricity lost in transmission and maximize the efficiency of our substation’s power distribution facilities. The initial phase of the development of the Corsicana Facility involved the construction of a 400 MW substation and an equal amount of immersion-cooled Bitcoin Mining infrastructure spread across multiple buildings, as well as construction of various utilities, offices, warehouses, and infrastructure to support the facility’s operations. Our Bitcoin Mining operations commenced in April 2024, following commissioning of the substation. As of December 31, 2024, we deployed 400 MW of Bitcoin Mining infrastructure comprised of four completed 100 MW buildings, Buildings A1, A2, B1, and B2. 
​
Through December 31, 2024, we incurred costs of approximately $415.9 million related to the development of the first phase of the Corsicana Facility, which consisted of $10.1 million for land and $405.8 million of initial developments costs and equipment. 
Revenue from Operations
Bitcoin Mining
We expect to generate ongoing revenue from Bitcoin rewards in connection with our Bitcoin Mining operations and our ability to liquidate Bitcoin rewards at future values will be regularly evaluated to generate cash for operations.
Generating Bitcoin rewards which exceed our production and overhead costs will determine our ability to report profit margins related to such Bitcoin Mining operations, although accounting for our reported profitability is significantly complex. Furthermore, regardless of our ability to generate proceeds from the sale of our Bitcoin produced from our Bitcoin Mining business, we may need to raise additional capital in the form of equity or debt to fund our operations and pursue our business strategy.
The ability to raise funds through the sale of equity, debt financings, or the sale of Bitcoin to maintain our operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties and any future equity issuances or convertible debt offerings could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and any future debt or debt securities may contain covenants that limit our operations or ability to enter into certain transactions. Our ability to realize revenue through Bitcoin production and successfully convert Bitcoin into cash or fund overhead with Bitcoin is subject to a number of risks, including regulatory, financial and business risks, many of which are beyond our control. Additionally, we have observed significant historical volatility in the market price of Bitcoin and, as such, future prices cannot be predicted. See the discussion of risks affecting our business under Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
Engineering
Substantially all Engineering revenue is derived from the sale of custom products built to customers’ specifications under fixed-price contracts. Revenue is recognized over time as performance creates or enhances an asset with no alternative use, and for which we have an enforceable right to receive compensation as defined under the contract. The length of time required to complete a custom product varies but is typically between four to 12 weeks.
Customers are typically required to make periodic progress payments based on contractually agreed-upon milestones. 
If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue from our Bitcoin Mining or Engineering operations when needed or secure additional sources of funding, it may be necessary to significantly reduce our current rate of spending or explore other strategic alternatives.
Long-term Debt
In December 2024, we issued $594.4 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Senior Notes maturing in 2030 (“2030 Notes”) and used $577.5 million of the net proceeds from the 2030 Notes to acquire 5,784 Bitcoin. 
As part of the Block Mining Acquisition, we 
acquired a $5.7 million note payable with a fixed interest rate of 8.81%. The note payable matures in December 2035, with annual principal and interest payments due beginning on December 31, 2024.

​
Operating Activities
The increase in cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily attributable to a $166.7 million reduction in proceeds from the sale of Bitcoin due to our ceasing of sales of Bitcoin early in 2024, increased power costs of $59.8 million, and a $73.5 million increase in selling, general, and administrative costs, excluding stock-based compensation, all of which were primarily driven by our increased mining capacity and headcount, combined with other general operating costs such as insurance and information technology projects to support our growth.
​
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, was primarily attributable to purchases of Bitcoin and purchases and deposits paid for miners and purchases of property and equipment for our ongoing expansions, as we continue towards our anticipated 38.4 EH/s of total self-mining hash rate capacity by the end of 2025. During 2024, we acquired 5,784 Bitcoin for approximately $577.5 million. We completed our expansion of the Rockdale Facility during the year ended December 31, 2023, and continued to develop the Corsicana Facility, which commenced self-mining operations during the second quarter of 2024, and the first phase of which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we paid $442.5 million and $230.4 million, respectively, in deposits and payments for the purchase of miners and paid $240.3 million and $193.7 million, respectively, for the purchases of property and equipment, including construction in process. During 2024, we also purchased 90.1 million shares of Bitfarms common stock for $203.8 million, acquired E4A Solutions for $50.9 million in cash (net of cash acquired), and acquired Block Mining for $7.2 million in cash (net of cash acquired).

Table of Contents
Financing Activities
For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, net cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of net proceeds from our ATM Offerings of $956.6 million and $761.8 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we received proceeds of $594.4 million from the issuance of the 2030 Notes, for which we paid debt issuance costs of approximately $15.2 million. In addition to the 2030 Notes, we assumed approximately $5.3 million in debt as part of the Block Mining Acquisition. We have primarily financed our strategic growth through proceeds from our ATM Offerings and issuances of our common stock. It is reasonably likely that we will continue to finance our ongoing growth with proceeds from current and future ATM Offerings and may utilize additional convertible debt offerings.
​
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
In preparing our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our Consolidated Financial Statements. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both (i) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (ii) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimates and assumptions is material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. These include: business combinations, valuation of the Rockdale PPA and the Corsicana PPA, long-lived assets and stock-based compensation. We believe these and other accounting policies set forth in Note 1
. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition.
We have discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board.
Business combinations
Accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including estimates for property and equipment and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe our assumptions and estimates have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Estimates used in determining the value of property and equipment included the estimated replacement costs, which included replacement cost new, remaining life, and effective age. Estimates primarily used in determining the value of the contingent consideration included the timing and probability of achieving milestones and discount rates.
Rockdale PPA and Corsicana PPA Valuation
The Rockdale PPA and the Corsicana PPA are accounted for as derivatives, the valuations of which are based on significant unobservable inputs utilized in the valuations, which include discounted cash flow estimation models containing quoted commodity exchange spot and forward prices and are adjusted for basis spreads for load zone-to-hub differentials through the respective terms of the Rockdale PPA and the Corsicana PPA. Significant judgement and estimations are required when creating the discounted cash flow estimation models. Should our discounted cash flow estimation models change significantly, potentially material changes to the fair value of the derivative asset may result, which could have a material impact on our financial statements.
See Note 9. 
Power Supply Agreements
 for a discussion of the unobservable inputs and their impact on the valuation.
Long-lived assets
Long-lived assets are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Judgment is necessary in estimating our various assets’ useful lives. This includes evaluating our own usage experience with our currently owned assets, the quality of materials used in construction-related projects, and for its miners, the rate of technological advancement and market-related factors such as the price of Bitcoin and the Bitcoin network hash rate, which impact the value of the miners. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, which is determined based on a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. Significant judgment is used when estimating future cash flows, particularly the price of Bitcoin and the Bitcoin network hash rate. If such assets are considered impaired, an impairment is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets.
52

Table of Contents
Should our estimates of useful lives, undiscounted future cash flows, or asset fair values change, additional and potentially material impairments may be required, which could have a material impact on our reported financial results.
Stock-based Compensation
Stock-based compensation expense related to share-based payment awards is recognized at the grant date of the award and is estimated based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant. Compensation cost for performance-based, share-based payment awards is recognized over the performance period when achievement of the milestones and targets becomes probable. We use significant judgment in determining the likelihood of meeting milestones and market conditions. Inputs into valuation models such as Monte Carlo simulations include both the Company’s and the Russell 3000’s historical and expected annual volatilities, and depending on the inputs selected, we could calculate significantly different estimated grant date fair values, materially impacting the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense we recognize in future periods.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
The following discussion about our market risk exposures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. For more information regarding the forward-looking statements used in this section and elsewhere in this Annual Report, see the “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the forepart of this Annual Report. 
The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.
Risk Regarding the Price of Bitcoin.
Our business and development strategy is focused on maintaining and expanding our Bitcoin Mining operations to maximize the amount of new Bitcoin rewards we earn. As of December 31, 2024, we held 17,722 Bitcoin that was recognized at its fair value of $1.7 billion. 
Of our Bitcoin held 11,938 were produced from our Bitcoin Mining operations and 5,784 were acquired using proceeds of approximately $577.5 million from the offering of the 2030 Notes.
We cannot accurately predict the future market price of Bitcoin, the future value of which will affect revenue from our operations, and any future declines in the fair value of the Bitcoin we mine and hold for our account would be reported in our financial statements and results of operations as a charge against net income, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price for our securities.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
​
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Riot Platforms, Inc. 
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
​
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Riot Platforms, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the 2024 and 2023 financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2022, before the effects of the retrospective adjustments to the disclosures for a change in the composition of reportable segments and the adoption of ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07), discussed in Notes 2 and 20 to the financial statements, were audited by predecessor auditors whose report, dated March 2, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements. We have also audited the adjustments to the 2022 consolidated financial statements to retrospectively adjust the disclosures for a change in the composition of reportable segments and apply the change in accounting for the adoption of ASU 2023-07 in 2024, as discussed in Notes 2 and 20 to the financial statements. Our procedures included (1) comparing the amounts of segment revenues, segment costs of revenue, and gross profit (loss) for both the change in composition of reportable segments and the adoption of ASU 2023-07 to the Company’s underlying accounting analysis, (2) comparing  the previously reported segment information per the Company’s accounting analysis to the adjustments for the adoption of ASU 2023-07, and (3) recalculating the mathematical accuracy of the reconciliations of segment amounts to the consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, such retrospective adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. However, we were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company other than with respect to these retrospective adjustments, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 2022 consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion 
​
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter 
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Mining Revenue – Refer to Notes 2 to the financial statements 
Critical Audit Matter Description 
The Company participates in a digital asset mining pool (“the mining pool”) by executing agreements with mining pool operators for the provision of hash calculation services to the mining pool. The Company decides when to provide hash calculation services under the agreements and the Company’s enforceable rights to compensation begins only when and lasts as long as the Company provides hash calculation services to the mining pool operator and is created as power is provided over time. In exchange for providing hash calculation services, the Company is entitled to a payout of Bitcoin based on a contractual formula, which primarily calculates the hash rate provided to the mining pool as a percentage of total network hash rate, and other inputs.  Revenue is recognized on the same day that control of the contracted service transfers to the mining pool operator, which is the same day as contract inception. For the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023, Bitcoin Mining revenue was $321.0 million, and $189.0 million, respectively.
We identified the auditing of Bitcoin Mining revenue as a critical audit matter due to the extent of audit effort required to perform audit procedures over the Company’s hash calculation services provided to the mining pool operator, the associated contractual payouts including the blockchain contractual inputs, the Company’s valuation of Bitcoin received from the mining pool operator and evaluating the results of those procedures.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit 
Our audit procedures related to the Company’s process for recording Bitcoin Mining revenue included the following, among others: 
●
With the assistance of our Information Technology (IT) specialists, we identified the significant systems used to monitor hash calculation services and tested the general IT controls over each of these systems.
●
We tested the effectiveness of controls over the Company’s Bitcoin Mining revenue calculation. 
●
We tested the amount of the Bitcoin Mining revenue recorded by developing an expectation for the amount recorded based on the hash calculation services provided to the mining pool operator and the payout method prescribed in the contract with the mining pool operator and comparing our expectation to the amount recorded by the Company. 
●
We confirmed with the mining pool operator the significant contractual terms utilized in the determination of Bitcoin Mining revenue, total mining rewards earned, and the digital asset wallet addresses in which the rewards are deposited. 
●
We utilized our proprietary audit tool to independently obtain evidence from the Bitcoin blockchain to test the occurrence and accuracy of Bitcoin Mining revenue.
●
With the assistance of our Valuation specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the prices utilized by the Company to value Bitcoin by obtaining independent Bitcoin prices and comparing those to the prices selected by the Company.

In our opinion, the 2022 financial statements, before the effects of the retrospective adjustments to the disclosures for a change in the composition of reportable segments and adoption of ASU 2023-07 discussed in Note 2 and Note 20 to the financial statements, present fairly, in all material respects, the results of the Company’s operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
​
We were not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the retrospective adjustments to the disclosures for a change in the composition of reportable segments and adoption of ASU 2023-07 discussed in Note 2 and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance about whether such retrospective adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. Those retrospective adjustments were audited by other auditors.
​
Basis for Opinion
​
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
​
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. 
​
Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Organization and Basis of Presentation
Organization
Riot Platforms is a vertically-integrated Bitcoin mining company principally engaged in enhancing our capabilities to mine Bitcoin in support of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Rockdale Facility is a large-scale Bitcoin mining facility in Rockdale, Texas and we 
completed Phase I of development of a second large-scale Bitcoin mining facility, the Corsicana Facility, which is currently equipped to provide up to 
400
 MW of capacity for our Bitcoin Mining. Upon completion, the Corsicana Facility is expected to have approximately 
1
 GW of capacity available.
 During 2024, the Company acquired the Kentucky Facility, which has existing
 operational Bitcoin mining capacity and the potential for significant expansion. Also, during 2024, the Company acquired E4A Solutions, a leading provider of electrical engineering services to a diverse customer base of energy developers and data center operators.
​
Basis of presentation and principles of consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements (“Consolidated Financial Statements”) and these notes (these “Notes”) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In the opinion of management, the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation of such results. 
The accompanying audited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
​
Unless otherwise indicated, amounts are stated in thousands of U.S. Dollars except for: share, per share, and miner amounts; Bitcoin quantities, prices, and hash rate; cost to mine one Bitcoin; and production value of one Bitcoin mined.
​
As described in Note 20. 
Segment Information
, we operate in 
two
 reportable business segments: Bitcoin Mining and Engineering.
​
Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the balance sheet and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements include revenue recognition; valuation of the derivative asset classified under Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy; determination of the useful lives and recoverability of long-lived assets; impairment analysis of fixed assets and finite-lived intangibles; impairment analysis of goodwill; allocating the fair value of purchase consideration to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business acquisitions; stock-based compensation; and the valuation allowance associated with the Company’s deferred tax assets. 
Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The reclassifications did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. The impact on any prior period disclosures was immaterial.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consists of cash on hand and highly liquid investments. We consider any highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at acquisition to be cash equivalents. From time to time, the Company’s cash account balances exceed the balances as covered by the FDIC. The Company has never suffered a loss due to such excess balances. 
Accounts receivable
The Company’s accounts receivable balance consists of amounts due from its mining pool operator and engineering customers. The Company records accounts receivable at the invoiced amount less an allowance for any potentially uncollectable accounts under the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) impairment model and presents the net amount of the receivable expected to be collected. 
F-10

Table of Contents
Riot Platforms, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The CECL impairment model requires an estimate of expected credit losses, measured over the contractual life of an instrument, which considers forecasts of future economic conditions in addition to information about past events and current conditions. Based on this model, the Company considers many factors, including the age of the balance, collection history, and current economic trends. Bad debts are written off after all collection efforts have ceased.
Allowances for credit losses are recorded as a direct reduction from an asset’s amortized cost basis. Credit losses and recoveries are recorded in 
Selling, general and administrative expenses
 in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Recoveries of financial assets previously written off are recorded when received. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recognized $
0.1
 million, $
0.0
 million, and $
0.0
 million respectively, in bad debt expense.
Based on the Company’s current and historical collection experience, management recorded allowances for doubtful accounts of $
2.9
 million and $
1.5
 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, retainage of $
1.0
 million and $
3.2
 million, respectively, was included in 
Accounts receivable, net
, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Bitcoin
The Company’s Bitcoin is recorded at fair value, as determined using the period-end closing price of Bitcoin on the Company’s principal market, Coinbase (the “Principal Market”), and changes in fair value are recognized in 
Change in fair value of Bitcoin
, in 
Operating income (loss)
 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
During 2024, Riot made the strategic decision to temporarily halt the sale of its Bitcoin production and instead, increase its Bitcoin holdings. As a result of its intent to hold its Bitcoin, the Company began classifying its Bitcoin held as a non-current asset on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. For all periods presented, all sales of Bitcoin occurred before the strategic decision and, as such Bitcoin was sold nearly immediately after receipt by the Company, the proceeds were recognized within 
Operating activities
 on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
Long-term investments
For equity investments, the Company initially records equity investments at cost then adjusts the carrying value of such equity investments through earnings when there is an observable transaction involving the same or a similar investment with the same issuer or upon an impairment.
For debt investments, such as convertible notes, the Company classifies them as available-for-sale debt instruments and recognizes the investments at fair value in 
Other long-term assets
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized changes in the fair value of the convertible note are recognized in 
Other comprehensive income (loss)
 on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Interest income is recognized within

Revenue recognition
Bitcoin Mining
The Company participates in digital asset mining pools by executing agreements with mining pool operators for the provision of hash calculation services to the mining pool. Currently, the Company only participates in a Full-Pay-Per-Share (“FPPS”) mining pool. The Company decides when to provide hash calculation services under the agreements and the Company’s enforceable right to compensation begins only when, and lasts as long as, the Company provides hash calculation services to the mining pool operator and is created as power is provided over time. The only consideration due to the Company relates to the provision of hash calculation services. Such agreements are freely terminable at any time by the Company or by the pool operator, without penalty to either party. Providing hash calculation services in digital asset transaction verification services is an output of the Company’s ordinary activities and is the only performance obligation in the agreements with mining pool operators. 
The transaction consideration received, if any, is noncash consideration in the form of Bitcoin. Changes in the fair value of the noncash consideration after contract inception due to the form of the consideration (changes in the market price of Bitcoin) are not included in the transaction price and, therefore, are not included in revenue. 
Certain mining pool operators charge fees to cover the costs of maintaining the pool. These fees are deducted from amounts we may otherwise earn and are treated as a reduction to the 
F-11

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
consideration received. Fees fluctuate and historically have averaged no more than 
approximately 
2
% per
 reward earned. 
Under the agreements neither party can dispute settlement terms after approximately 35 days following settlement. 
In exchange for providing hash calculation services, the Company is entitled to a FPPS payout of Bitcoin based on a contractual formula, which primarily calculates the hash rate provided to the mining pool as a percentage of total network hash rate, and other inputs. 
The Company is entitled to consideration even if a block is not successfully placed by the mining pool operator. Bitcoin network block subsidies are based on the total amount of block subsidies that are expected to be generated on the Bitcoin network as a whole during the 24-hour period beginning at 0:00:00 UTC daily (i.e., the “measurement period”), while network transaction fees are based on the total amount of transaction fees and block rewards that are actually generated on the blockchain network as a whole during the measurement period. The Company is also entitled to a fractional share of the Bitcoin award and transaction fees from the mining pool operator as determined based on the hash rate provided by the Company to the mining pool as a percentage of the total expected Bitcoin network hash rate based on the current network difficulty. The Company is entitled to its relative share of consideration at the end of each measurement period, even if a block is not successfully placed by the mining pool. 
For accounting purposes, the agreement by and between the Company and the mining pool operator has a duration of less than 24 hours as a result of the agreement being continually renewed at the beginning of each measurement period. However, the continual renewal of the agreement does not represent a material right requiring separate performance obligations, as the FPPS formula remains the same upon each renewal.
Consideration is all variable. Revenue is recognized on the same day that control of the contracted service transfers to the mining pool operator, which is the same day as contract inception. As it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur and we are able to calculate the payout based on the contractual formula, revenue is estimated and recognized based on the spot price of Bitcoin determined using the Company’s Principal Market at the beginning of each measurement period, which the Company considers to be 0:00:00 UTC on the date of contract inception. Noncash consideration is measured at fair value at agreement inception. The fair value of the crypto asset consideration is determined using the quoted price per the Principal Market at the beginning of each measurement period at the single Bitcoin level (one Bitcoin). 
There is no significant financing component in these transactions, due to the performance obligations and settlement of the transactions being on a daily basis.
Engineering
Substantially all revenue is derived from the sale of custom products built to customers’ specifications under fixed-price contracts with one identified performance obligation. Revenue is recognized over time as performance creates or enhances an asset with no alternative use, and for which the Company has an enforceable right to receive compensation as defined under the contract.
To determine the amount of revenue to recognize over time, the Company utilizes the cost-to-cost method as management believes cost incurred best represents the amount of work completed and remaining on projects. As the cost-to-cost method is driven by incurred cost, the Company calculates the percentage of completion by dividing costs incurred to date by the total estimated cost. The percentage of completion is then multiplied by the estimated contract amount to determine inception-to-date revenue. Approved changes to design plans are generally recognized as a cumulative adjustment to the percentage of completion calculation. Revenue recognized for the period is the current inception-to-date recognized revenue less the prior period inception-to-date recognized revenue. If a contract is projected to result in a loss, the entire contract loss is recognized in the period when the loss was first determined, and any additional losses incurred subsequently are recognized in the subsequent reporting periods as they are identified. Additionally, contract costs incurred to date and expected total contract costs are continuously monitored during the term of the contract.
Changes in the job performance, job conditions and final contract settlements are factors that influence management’s assessment of total contract value and the total estimated costs to complete those contracts, and therefore, profit and revenue recognition. Any costs to obtain a contract are not material to the Company’s financial statements and would be expensed as incurred. Because of the inherent uncertainties in estimating costs, it is at least reasonably possible that the estimates used will change within the near term. The length of time for the Company to complete a custom product varies but is typically between four to 12 weeks.
Customers are typically required to make periodic progress payments to the Company based on contractually agreed-upon milestones. Invoices are due net, 30 days, and retainage, if any, is generally due 30 days after delivery. Taxes collected from 
F-12

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs are treated as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales.
Fair value measurement
Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.
Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, for similar assets or liabilities that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activity and that are financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.
The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The Company will update its assumptions each reporting period based on new developments and record such amounts at fair value based on the revised assumptions until the agreements expire or contingency is resolved, as applicable.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements are typically the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the life of the term of the lease. The estimated useful lives for all the Company’s property and equipment are as follows:
​

​

​
Impairment of long-lived assets
Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.
Goodwill 
Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized and is reviewed for impairment annually as of December 31, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. We use both qualitative and quantitative analyses in making this determination. The Company determined that it has two reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes, Bitcoin Mining and Engineering, which are consistent with internal management reporting and management’s oversight of operations. Our analyses require significant assumptions and judgments, including assumptions about future economic conditions, revenue growth, and operating margins, among other factors. Examples of events or changes in circumstances considered in the qualitative analysis, many of which are subjective in nature, include: a significant negative trend in our industry or overall 
F-13

Table of Contents
Riot Platforms, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
economic trends, a significant change in how we use the acquired assets, a significant change in our business strategy, a significant decrease in the market value of the asset, a significant change in regulations or in the industry that could affect the value of the asset, and a change in segments. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs the quantitative test to identify and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered impaired and that excess is recognized as a goodwill impairment loss.
Finite-lived intangible assets
Intangible assets with finite lives are comprised of customer contracts, trademarks, UL Listings, and patents that are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives, which is their contractual term or estimated useful life. Patent costs consisting of filing and legal fees incurred are initially recorded at cost. The Company performs assessments to determine whether finite-lived classification is still appropriate at least annually. The carrying value of finite-lived assets and their remaining useful lives are also reviewed at least annually to determine if circumstances exist which may indicate a potential impairment or revision to the amortization period. A finite-lived intangible asset is considered to be impaired if its carrying value exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from it. We exercise judgment in selecting the assumptions used in the estimated future undiscounted cash flows analysis. Impairment is measured by the amount that the carrying value exceeds fair value.
The use of different estimates or assumptions could result in significantly different fair values for our reporting units and intangible assets.
Business combinations
The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting by recognizing the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquired business, measured at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the aforementioned amounts. Contingent consideration is included within the purchase price and is recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date. A liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value as of each reporting date until the contingency is resolved, and subsequent changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. Contingent consideration is recorded in current and long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately apply preliminary values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, these estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of the assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date, including estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, pre-acquisition contingencies, and contingent consideration, where applicable. The fair value assigned to acquired assets and liabilities assumed are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include future expected cash flows from customer contracts, discount rates, and estimated market changes in the value of the Rockdale PPA, which is accounted for as a nonhedged derivative contract. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates, or actual results.
Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.
Investment in marketable equity securities
For investments in marketable equity securities in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee, the Company accounts for its investment using the equity method of accounting.  Determining the ability of an investor to exercise significant influence is not always clear and applying judgment is necessary to assess the status of each investment. 
​
F-14

Table of Contents
Riot Platforms, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The Company has elected to measure its equity method marketable equity securities at fair value at each balance sheet date, with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded in other income (expense), as the shares have a readily determinable fair value since they are publicly traded and have significant average daily volume traded. 
Convertible Debt Arrangements
Convertible debt securities contain embedded conversion options that must be first evaluated to determine if bifurcation and separate accounting would be required for the embedded feature. As a result, the Company is required: (1) to analyze whether the conversion feature meets the definition of a derivative and is not eligible for an exception from this guidance (otherwise, the conversion feature will be recognized as a derivative) and (2) to analyze whether there is a significant premium associated with the convertible debt instrument (otherwise, the Company will allocate the debt proceeds with the premium being allocated to equity). If neither condition is met, the entire instrument will be accounted for as debt (i.e., no bifurcation is needed). The embedded conversion features in the Company’s convertible debt securities are deemed to be indexed to the Company’s common stock and meet the criteria for classification in stockholders’ equity, and therefore derivative accounting does not apply. Therefore, the Company recognizes its convertible debt securities as long-term debt on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of unamortized debt issuance costs. The associated debt issuance costs are amortized into interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations using the effective interest method over the term of the debt.
Leases
The Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of the arrangement. If a lease is determined to exist, the term of such lease is assessed based on the date on which the underlying asset is made available for the Company’s use by the lessor. The Company’s assessment of the lease term reflects the non-cancelable term of the lease, inclusive of any rent-free periods and/or periods covered by early-termination options which the Company is reasonably certain of not exercising, as well as periods covered by renewal options which the Company is reasonably certain of exercising. The Company also determines lease classification as either operating or finance at lease commencement, which governs the pattern of expense recognition and the presentation reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the lease term. For all periods presented, the Company only had operating leases. 
For leases with a term exceeding 12 months, an operating lease liability is recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at lease commencement reflecting the present value of its fixed minimum payment obligations over the lease term. A corresponding operating lease right-of-use asset equal to the initial lease liability is also recorded, adjusted for any prepaid rent and/or initial direct costs incurred in connection with execution of the lease and reduced by any lease incentives received. For purposes of measuring the present value of its fixed payment obligations for a given lease, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, determined based on information available at lease commencement, as rates implicit in its leasing arrangements are typically not readily determinable. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate reflects the rate it would pay to borrow on a secured basis and incorporates the term and economic environment of the associated lease.
For the Company’s operating leases, fixed lease payments are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, any fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and are not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as an accounting policy election. Leases qualifying for the short-term lease exception were insignificant. Variable lease costs are recognized as incurred and primarily consist of common area maintenance and utility charges not included in the measurement of right of use assets and operating lease liabilities.
Operating segments
Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which discrete financial information is available that is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), which is comprised of several members of its executive management team, including the CEO, Executive Chairman, EVO-CFO, EVP-Head of Corporate Development & Strategy, and COO. The CODM uses segment gross profit (loss) to assess the performance of, manage the operations of, and allocate capital and operational resources to the Company’s 
two
 reportable segments.
Change in Reportable Segments
Previously, the Company operated in 
three
 reportable business segments: Bitcoin Mining, Data Center Hosting, and Engineering. As of January 1, 2024, the Company has terminated all contracts with its legacy data center hosting customers and made the strategic decision to no longer offer data center hosting services to customers. Commencing with the three months ended March 31, 2024, the 
F-15

Riot Platforms, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Data Center Hosting Segment no longer met the quantitative requirements as a reportable segment, and the CODM ceased analyzing the performance of the Company’s legacy data center hosting operations. As such, the Data Center Hosting Segment has been eliminated as a separate reportable segment. Bitcoin Mining and Engineering are the Company’s 
two
 remaining reportable business segments. See Note 20. 
Segment Information 
for more information.
Income taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is required to the extent any deferred tax assets may not be realizable.
Contract balances
Contract assets consist of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted engineering contracts.
Deferred revenue relates to upfront payments and consideration received from customers for the upfront license fee generated from our legacy animal health business.  Contract liabilities consist of billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted engineering contracts.
​
Remaining performance obligations
Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of contracts for work that has not yet been performed. The Company elected the practical expedient to not adjust the transaction price for the existence of a significant financing component if the timing difference between a customer’s payment and our performance is one year or less.
​
Stock-based compensation
The Company accounts for share-based payment awards exchanged for services at the estimated grant date fair value of the award, which is based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the time of the grant. For performance-based share-based payment awards, the Company recognizes compensation cost over the performance period when achievement of the milestones and targets is probable.
The Company has elected to account for forfeitures of awards as they occur.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements
The Company continually assesses new accounting pronouncements to determine their applicability. When it is determined that a new accounting pronouncement affects the Company’s financial reporting, the Company undertakes a study to determine the consequences of such change to its Consolidated Financial Statements and assures that there are proper controls in place to ascertain that the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements properly reflect the change.
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures 
(“ASU 2023-09”). ASU 2023-09 expands existing income tax disclosures for rate reconciliations by requiring disclosure of certain specific categories and additional reconciling items that meet quantitative thresholds and expands disclosures for income taxes paid by requiring disaggregation by certain jurisdictions. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024; early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact the updated guidance will have on its disclosures.

Note 3. Acquisitions
E4A Solutions Acquisition
On December 16, 2024, the Company acquired 
100
%
 of the equity interests of E4A Solutions, a Texas-based electrical engineering solutions company, for total consideration of approximately 
$
54.4
 million, which was comprised of 
$
51.8
 million paid for using the Company’s existing cash and a contingent purchase price payable to the sellers with an estimated fair value of 
$
2.6
 million. Under the contingent purchase price payable, the sellers are eligible to earn potential earn-out targets based on E4A Solutions’ Adjusted EBITDA during the two years ending December 31, 2026, payable in cash or Riot common stock at the Company’s discretion. The potential earnout is calculated as 
2.65
 times the amount the average adjusted EBITDA exceeds the Earnout threshold, as defined in the purchase agreement.
E4A Solutions is a provider of electrical engineering services to a diverse customer base of energy developers and data center operators. This acquisition adds to Riot’s vertically integrated strategy by adding engineering expertise to service its own existing and future electrical infrastructure as well as provide solutions and services to the rapidly growing market for electrical infrastructure. 
​
The acquisition was accounted for as an acquisition of a business using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values on the date of acquisition. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has completed a preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration. Therefore, the allocation of the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on provisional estimates and is subject to continuing management analysis, with assistance from third party valuation advisors. The Company expects to finalize the valuation of these assets and liabilities, and consideration transferred, as soon as practicable, but not later than one year from the acquisition date. Any changes to the preliminary estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recorded as adjustments to those assets and liabilities and residual amounts will be allocated to goodwill.

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, other long-term assets, accounts payable, contract liabilities, accrued expenses, and other long-term liabilities were determined to be the carrying values due to the immaterial and/or short-term nature of the assets and liabilities. 
The finite-lived intangible assets consist of a trademark and customer relationships. The fair value of the trademark was estimated using the relief from royalty rate method, which estimated future royalty charges attributable to the trademark. The fair value of the customer relationships was estimated using the income approach, which estimated future revenues and costs of the existing customer relationships.  The estimated fair values of the trademark and customer relationship utilized a 
discount
 rate of 
13.4
%
.
The right of use asset and operating lease liabilities consisted of an operating lease of office and commercial space in Houston, Texas. The lease has annual payments of approximately 
$
0.4
 million and a remaining lease term of approximately 
two years
 as of acquisition.
​
Goodwill was attributable to the assembled workforce of experienced personnel at E4A Solutions and synergies expected to be achieved from the combined operations of Riot and E4A Solutions. The goodwill recognized is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. We assigned the goodwill to our Engineering reportable segment.
The operating results of E4A Solutions have been included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations since the acquisition date. Through December 31, 2024, the Company recognized approximately 
$
2.7
 million of acquisition-related costs related to this acquisition that were expensed as incurred. 
From the acquisition date through December 31, 2024, E4A Solution’s total revenue and net income was approximately 
$
0.8
 million and less than 
$
0.1
 million, respectively.

Block Mining Acquisition
On July 23, 2024, the Company acquired 
100
%
 of the equity interests of Block Mining, for total consideration of approximately 
$
113.6
 million, which was comprised of 
$
13.5
 million in cash (adjusted for net working capital acquired and other items, excluding the payoff of debt of 
$
5.0
 million, which was accounted for as a transaction separate from the acquisition) from the Company’s existing cash, 
7.2
 million shares of Riot common stock valued at approximately 
$
74.0
 million, and a contingent purchase price payable to the sellers with an estimated fair value of 
$
26.1
 million. Under the contingent purchase price payable, the sellers are eligible to earn up to 
$
32.5
 million in potential earn-out targets if certain milestones are reached by December 31, 2025. 
The Block Mining Acquisition immediately increased Riot’s hash rate, expanded Riot’s footprint geographically, and provided exposure to additional energy markets outside of ERCOT
, including the Paducah Power Systems, Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)

. Block Mining is a vertically-integrated Bitcoin miner consisting of 
two
 operational sites, both in Kentucky, which consist of existing operational Bitcoin mining capacity, with the potential to expand. Additionally, Block Mining owns a separate greenfield expansion opportunity in Kentucky, adjacent to an existing substation, presenting the opportunity for further expansion. Block Mining is a capital efficient

developer and operator of Bitcoin mining facilities with an experienced management team that will add to Riot’s ability to execute on its vertically-integrated strategy.

The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses were determined to be the carrying values due to the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities. 
The fair value of property and equipment was estimated by applying the cost approach, which uses the replacement cost as an indicator of fair value. The assumptions of the cost approach include replacement cost new and physical deterioration factors including remaining life and effective age. The replacement cost new was based on a price per terahash consistent with prices the Company pays for new Bitcoin miners and an effective age of three years, consistent with the Company’s current estimated useful life of Bitcoin miners.
The right of use asset and operating lease liabilities consisted of an operating lease of a data center in Calvert City, Kentucky. The lease has annual payments of approximately 
$
1.4
 million and a remaining lease term of approximately 
3.0
 years as of acquisition.
The assumed debt consisted of a 
$
5.0

million secured loan and a 
$
5.7
 million note payable. The secured loan was paid off on the date of acquisition. The note payable carries a fixed rate of 
8.81
%
, and matures in December 2035, with annual principal and accrued interest payments beginning on December 31, 2024. The fair value of the debt at acquisition of 
$
5.7
 million was determined to equal its carrying value due at acquisition, as the interest rate is reasonably consistent with rates the Company would expect to incur for similar debt instruments. 
Goodwill was attributable to the assembled workforce of experienced personnel at Block Mining and synergies expected to be achieved from the combined operations of Riot and Block Mining. The goodwill recognized is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. We assigned the goodwill to our Bitcoin Mining reportable segment.
The operating results of Block Mining have been included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations since the acquisition date. Through December 31, 2024, the Company recognized 
$
2.8
 million of acquisition-related costs related to this acquisition that were expensed as incurred.

Note 6. Investments
Equity method investment - marketable securities
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company acquired approximately 
90.1
 million common shares of Bitfarms Ltd. (“Bitfarms”) on the open market for approximately $
203.8
 million. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s investment in Bitfarms was equal to approximately 
19.9
% of all outstanding Bitfarms common stock. 
In September 2024, the Company and Bitfarms entered into a settlement agreement, under which the Company intends to review its investment in Bitfarms on a continuing basis and, subject to the terms of the settlement agreement, depending upon various factors, including without limitation, any discussion between the Company, Bitfarms and/or the Board of Bitfarms and Bitfarms’ advisors regarding, among other things, Bitfarms’ financial position and strategic direction, overall market conditions, other investment opportunities available to the Company, and the availability of securities of Bitfarms at prices that would make the purchase or sale of such securities desirable, the Company may (i) increase or decrease its position in Bitfarms through, among other things, the purchase or sale of securities of Bitfarms, including through transactions involving its common shares and/or other equity, debt, 
F-21

Table of Contents
Riot Platforms, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
notes, other securities, or derivative or other instruments that are based upon or relate to the value of securities of Bitfarms in the open market or otherwise, (ii) enter into transactions that increase or hedge its economic exposure to its investment without affecting its beneficial ownership of Bitfarms common stock or (iii) consider or propose other actions, including submitting a revised proposal to acquire Bitfarms.
​
On September 23, 2024, Bitfarms appointed an independent director to its board of directors that the Company proposed to be nominated and supported. As a result, for accounting purposes, the Company determined it obtained the ability to exercise significant influence over its investment. Therefore, the Company began accounting for its investment under the equity method of accounting and elected to account for it at fair value. There have been no intra-entity transactions, and therefore, no intra-entity profits or losses. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized in 
Other income (expense)
 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value measurement of the Company’s investment in Bitfarms is based on quoted prices in an active market and valued at the closing price reported at the end of each period and thus represents a Level 1 measurement on the fair value hierarchy.

Convertible note
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company invested in a $
4.5
 million convertible note at face value. The convertible note has a 
three-year
 term and earns interest at a rate of 
12
% per annum, which may be paid in cash or in-kind, and converts into equity of the issuer of the convertible note at the end of the 
three-year
 term. 
The convertible note is accounted for as an available-for-sale debt instrument and is recognized at fair value in 
Other long-term assets
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized changes in the fair value of the convertible note are recognized in 
Other comprehensive income (loss)
 on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). Interest income is recognized within 
Interest income (expense)
 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
The fair value measurement of the convertible note is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement on the fair value hierarchy. The significant assumptions used to estimate fair value of the convertible note as of December 31, 2024, primarily consisted of a discount rate of 
12.4
%
, which reflected the issuance date spread premium over the selected yield for the remaining time to maturity.

The Company determined that the issuer of the convertible preferred note was a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and that the Company held a variable interest in the issuer of the convertible preferred note. The Company has considered the amount it is contributing to the issuer, its lack of decision-making rights and control, among other factors, and has concluded that it does not hold a controlling financial interest and does not have majority decision-making control. Therefore, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and as a result, the Company is not required to consolidate the VIE. The entire $
4.5
 million investment is at risk of loss. 
Coinsquare and Mogo
In September 2017, and February 2018, the Company acquired a minority interest for $
9.4
 million in Coinsquare Ltd., a Canadian cryptocurrency exchange (“Coinsquare”), which operates a digital cryptocurrency exchange platform in Canada. The investment resulted in an approximately 
11.7
% ownership in Coinsquare by the Company on a fully diluted basis. The Company elected to account for the investment using the measurement alternative as the equity securities are without a readily determinable fair value

and do not give the Company significant influence over Coinsquare. Per the measurement alternative, the investment is recorded at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, under agreements between Coinsquare, Coinsquare’s shareholders (including Riot) and Mogo Inc. (NASDAQ: MOGO), a digital payments and financial technology company (“Mogo”), Riot sold all 
3.4
 million common shares of Coinsquare in exchange for approximately 
3.2
 million common shares of Mogo and approximately $
1.8
 million in cash.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold all 
3.2
 million shares of its shares of Mogo for proceeds of $
1.8
 million, resulting in realized losses of approximately $
9.0
 million.

The Company recognized an impairment charge for its miners and mining equipment during the year ended December 31, 2022, as described below, but did not incur any other impairment charges for its property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Miners and mining equipment
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had deployed miners in its Bitcoin Mining operations at its Rockdale Facility, Corsicana Facility, and Kentucky Facility. As of December 31, 2023, all the Company’s deployed miners were at its Rockdale Facility. 
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company entered into the Master Agreement to acquire miners from MicroBT
. In 2023
, we executed purchase orders with MicroBT to acquire U.S.-manufactured miners with a total hash rate of 
25.6
 EH/s, for a total purchase price of approximately $
453.4
 million, subject to downward adjustment, as provided under the Master Agreement. Delivery of these miners to the Corsicana Facility, for deployment in immersion cooling systems, began in 2023, and all miners under these purchase orders are expected to be received and deployed by mid-2025. The Master Agreement also provides the Company with an option to purchase additional miners with a total hash rate of approximately 
75.0
 EH/s, on the same terms as the initial order.
​
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company entered into an additional purchase order with MicroBT under the Master Agreement to acquire 
31,500
 air-cooled miners with a total hash rate of 
5.9
 EH/s for a total purchase price of approximately $
96.7
 million. This purchase order is in addition to existing purchase options under the Master Agreement. Delivery of these miners occurred during the year ended December 31, 2024. 
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we sold 
19,817
 and 
2,700
, underperforming Antminer model S19 XP miners, respectively, for which we recognized losses of $
17.4
 million and $
5.3
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
Effective January 1, 2024, as a result of new information about the useful lives of Bitcoin miners, the Company determined the estimated useful life of its Bitcoin miners will be increased from 
two years
 to 
three years
. In making this determination, the Company 
F-23

Table of Contents
Riot Platforms, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
took into consideration its first-hand experience of miners remaining in service beyond a two-year period, as well as its increased use of immersion-based mining, which the Company anticipates will extend the useful life of miners, due to improved heat removal and reduced exposure to particulates, as compared to traditional air-cooled mining. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation expense and an increase in net income of approximately $
78.3
 million, and increases in basic earnings per share of $
0.28
 and diluted earnings per share of $
0.25
. 
​
Impairment of miners 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, adverse changes in business climate, including decreases in the price of Bitcoin and resulting decrease in the market price of miners, indicated that an impairment triggering event had occurred. Testing performed indicated the estimated fair value of the Company’s miners to be less than their net carrying value as of December 31, 2022, and an impairment charge of $
55.5
 million was recognized, decreasing the net carrying value of the Company’s miners to their estimated fair value. The estimated fair value of the Company’s miners was classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy due to the quoted market prices for similar assets. 
Casualty-related charges (recoveries), net
In December 2022, the Rockdale Facility was damaged during severe winter storms in Texas. As of December 31, 2024, the Company estimated that total damages of $
10.3
 million had been incurred. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company received net insurance recoveries of $
2.8
 million, in addition to the $
7.5
 million recovered during the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily related to the damage incurred at Rockdale Facility. Recoveries are recognized when they are probable of being received. 
Construction in progress
In 2022, the Company initiated development of the Corsicana Facility to expand its Bitcoin Mining capabilities, on a 
265
-acre site in Navarro County, Texas, located near the Navarro Switch. 
The initial phase of development of the Corsicana Facility involves the construction of immersion-cooled Bitcoin Mining infrastructure, including a high-voltage power substation and electrical and water transmission facilities to supply power and water to the facility. Operations of this initial phase of the development commenced in April 2024, following energization of the substation. As of December 31, 2024, the initial phase of Corsicana was complete with deployed Bitcoin Mining infrastructure comprising of four operational buildings, Buildings A1, A2, B1, and B2.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire immersion cooling systems for use in Bitcoin Mining facilities developed at the Corsicana Facility. Delivery and installation of these immersion cooling systems was completed during the year ended December 31, 2024, with miner installation and operations commencing progressively as the systems were installed. The purchase agreement also provides the Company an option to purchase additional immersion cooling systems from the same manufacturer, on the same terms as the initial order, through December 31, 2025.
​
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company entered into a second purchase agreement to acquire immersion cooling systems from a different manufacturer for use in the Bitcoin Mining facilities at the Corsicana Facility. Delivery of these immersion cooling systems was completed during the year ended December 31, 2024. 
Through December 31, 2024, the Company incurred total costs of approximately $
415.9
 million related to the development of the first phase of the Corsicana Facility (exclusive of miners), including $
10.1
 million paid to acquire the land on which the facility was  developed. 
​
Related party land transaction
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company began an initiative to provide certain on-site temporary housing for stakeholders, including partners, analysts, stockholders, employees, vendors, and other visitors to the Rockdale Facility, which is located in a relatively remote area of central Texas with limited accommodations for visitors. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Riot completed its acquisition of property and land for the development of temporary housing from Lyle Theriot (indirectly, through a limited liability company controlled by Mr. Theriot) for approximately $
1.1
 million, consisting of $
0.2
 million for land and $
0.9
 million for buildings and improvements. At the time of the transaction, Mr. Theriot was part of the management team at Riot and was considered a related party of Riot. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition.

Note 8. Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill
The goodwill balance of $
121.9
 million as of December 31, 2024, was attributable to the assembled workforces of experienced personnel at Block Mining and E4A Solutions and synergies expected to be achieved as a result of the Company’s acquisitions. See Note 3. 
Acquisitions
. 
During the second quarter of 2022, adverse changes in business climate, including decreases in the price of Bitcoin and increased volatility of equity markets, as evidenced by declines in the market price of the Company’s securities, those of its peers, and major market indices, reduced market multiples and increased weighted-average costs of capital, primarily driven by an increase in interest rates. Market concerns related to inflation, supply chain disruption issues and other macroeconomic factors were some of the primary causes for these declines. Additionally, the price of Bitcoin had declined significantly, notably during the second quarter of 2022. 
Due to these factors, the Company determined that a triggering event had occurred, and therefore, performed a goodwill impairment assessment as of June 30, 2022. The valuation of the Company’s reporting units was determined with the assistance of an independent valuation specialist firm using a market approach. The market approach was based on the Guideline Public Company Method, which is derived from metrics of publicly traded companies or historically completed transactions of comparable businesses. The selection of comparable businesses was based on the markets in which the reporting units operated, giving consideration to risk profiles, size, geography, and diversity of products and services. Under the market approach, the Company evaluated the fair value based on trailing and forward-looking earnings and revenue multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar market position and size as the Company’s reporting units. The unobservable inputs used to measure the fair value included projected revenue growth rates, the price of Bitcoin, the global Bitcoin network hash rate, the timing of miner shipments under currently executed contracts and their subsequent deployment, and the determination of appropriate market comparison companies. The trailing-twelve-month and next-twelve-month enterprise value-to-revenue multiples assumed in the analysis ranged from approximately 0.7x to approximately 3.9x. The resulting estimated fair values of the combined reporting units were reconciled to the Company’s market capitalization, including an estimated implied control premium of approximately 
30
%.
The results of the quantitative test indicated the fair value of the reporting units did not exceed their carrying amounts, including goodwill, in excess of the carrying value of the goodwill. As a result, the entire carrying amount of the goodwill was recognized as a non-cash impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Note 9. Power Supply Agreements
Rockdale Facility 
Power Purchase Agreement
In May 2020, the Company, through its subsidiary, Whinstone, entered into the Rockdale PPA to provide for the delivery of power to its Rockdale Facility, via the nearby Sandow Switch. Pursuant to the Rockdale PPA, the Company has agreed to acquire a total of 
345
 MW of long-term, fixed-price power, in multiple blocks, as follows: 
130
 MW contracted in May 2020, at fixed prices through April 30, 2030; 
65
 MW contracted in March 2022, at fixed prices through April 30, 2030; and 
150
 MW contracted in November 2022, at fixed prices through October 31, 2027. Additionally, under the Rockdale PPA, the Company has the option to purchase additional power at market prices, as needed.      
Under the Rockdale PPA, the Company may also elect not to utilize its long-term, fixed-price power for its operations, and instead elect to sell that power in exchange for credits against future power costs when there is a benefit to the Company, depending on the spot market price of electricity. The Company’s power strategy combines participation in Demand Response Services Programs, as described below, participation in ERCOT’s Four Coincident Peak (“4CP”) program, and sales of power, to attempt to manage operating costs most efficiently. 
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company earned credits against future power costs in exchange for power resold of approximately $
33.7
 million, $
71.2
 million, and $
27.3
 million, respectively. These amounts are recorded in 
Power curtailment credits
 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company determined the Rockdale PPA meets the definition of a derivative because it allows for net settlement. However, because the Company has the ability to offer the power back for sale outside of the Rockdale PPA, rather than taking physical delivery, the Company determined that physical delivery is not probable through the entirety of the contract and therefore, the Company does not believe the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception applies to the Rockdale PPA. Accordingly, the Rockdale PPA (a non-hedging derivative contract) is accounted for as a derivative and recorded at its estimated fair value each reporting period in 
Derivative asset
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with the change in the fair value recorded in 
Change in fair 
F-26

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
value of derivative asset
 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Rockdale PPA is not designated as a hedging instrument. The Facilities Agreement, Demand Response Service Programs, and the 4CP program are not part of the Rockdale PPA, and are therefore not subject to treatment and valuation as a derivative along with Rockdale PPA. 
The terms of the Rockdale PPA require margin-based collateral, calculated as exposure resulting from fluctuations in the market cost rate of electricity versus the fixed price stated in the contract. As of December 31, 2024, the margin-based collateral requirement of the Company was 
zero
.
While the Company manages operating costs at the Rockdale Facility in part by periodically selling back unused or uneconomical power, the Company does not consider such actions to be trading activities. 
Demand Response Services Programs
Concurrently with the Rockdale PPA, Whinstone entered into an interconnection agreement for the extension of delivery system transmission/substation facilities to facilitate delivery of electricity to the Rockdale Facility (the “Facilities Agreement”). Power costs incurred under the Facilities Agreement are determined every 15 minutes using settlement information provided by ERCOT and are recorded in 
Cost of revenue 
on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the construction of the interconnection was completed and power costs under the Facilities Agreement are no longer being incurred. 
ERCOT has implemented Demand Response Services Programs for customers like the Company that have the ability to reduce or modify electricity use in response to ERCOT instructions or signals. These Demand Response Services Programs provide the ERCOT market with valuable grid stability and economic services by helping to preserve system reliability, enhancing competition and load predictability, mitigating price spikes, and stabilizing the grid by encouraging the demand side of the market to give more visibility and control of their power consumption to grid operators. Market participants with flexible electrical loads, like the Company, may participate in these Demand Response Service Programs directly by offering their electrical loads into the ERCOT markets, or indirectly by voluntarily reducing their energy usage in response to increasing power demand in the ERCOT marketplace. The Demand Response Services Programs run concurrent with the Rockdale PPA. 
​
Under these Demand Response Services Programs, the Company can participate in a variety of programs known as “ancillary services” by electing to designate a portion of its available electrical load for participation in such programs on a forward basis. For each respective Demand Response Services Program, the Company receives compensation based on hourly rates for power and the amount of electrical load which it has bid into the program. Through ancillary services, the Company competitively bids amongst other market participants to sell ERCOT the ability to control the Company’s electrical load on demand, which requires the Company to remain powered on during the times in which its power is bid into ancillary services, and giving ERCOT the ability to direct the Company to power down the amount of power bid into the program. The Company receives compensation for its participation in ancillary services whether or not the Company is actually called to power down. 
The Company also participates in the 4CP program, which refers to the highest-load settlement intervals in each of the four summer months (June, July, August, and September), during which time, demand for power is typically at its highest across the ERCOT grid. The 4CP program participants may voluntarily power down operations during these times and in doing so, reduce the electrical load demand on the ERCOT grid. Participants that reduce their load in these peak periods receive credits to transmission costs on future power bills during the subsequent year, reducing overall power costs for the year. As a result of participation in the 4CP program in 2023, the Company’s transmission charges in its ongoing 2024 monthly power bills are substantially reduced. The 4CP program has an indefinite life. 
Corsicana Facility
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s subsidiary, Riot Corsicana, LLC, entered into an agreement with ICE Futures U.S., Inc., a subsidiary of the InterContinental Exchange to access the exchange for the execution of electricity futures contracts. The Company intends to purchase agreements up to the amount of power used at the Corsicana Facility. These financial instruments meet the definition of derivatives, but are not designated as hedging instruments, and will be recognized at fair value, with any gains or losses recognized in Net income (loss) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
The Company has entered into the electricity futures contracts to manage electricity price risk and reduce the variability of cash flows associated with purchases of electricity used for the Company’s Bitcoin Mining operations at the Corsicana Facility.

Riot Platforms, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
As of December 31, 2024, the Company held outstanding electricity futures contracts for 
26,992
 mWh with a combined fair value of $
0.3
 million included in 
Prepaid expenses and other current assets
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2024, realized and unrealized gains of $
0.3
 million were recognized in

 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
​
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s subsidiary, Riot Corsicana, LLC, also entered into a requirements contract with MEMS Industrial Supply (“MEMSIS” or “Mitsui”) under which it will purchase retail power to meet the consumption requirements of the Corsicana Facility. Electric power will be invoiced by MEMSIS based upon the market price for electric power at the ERCOT North Load Zone, plus a retail adder corresponding to the peak consumption threshold of the Corsicana Facility, and pass through charges (ex., ancillary charges, taxes, congestion, and line loss), based on the actual variable consumption of the Corsicana Facility. The contract, dated November 12, 2024, has a 3-year term ending November 25, 2027.  Although this contract does not require the supply of power at a fixed price, it allows the parties to enter into fixed-price contracts.  

Under the requirements contract with MEMSIS, during the year ended December 31, 2024, Riot and MEMSIS entered into the Corsicana PPA, a 3-year contract (January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2027, but excluding July and August contracts during the period) for a fixed quantity of 
25
 MW at a fixed price of $
43.95
 per mWh.
​
The Company determined the Corsicana PPA with MEMSIS meets the definition of a derivative and, accordingly, the Corsicana PPA (a non-hedging derivative contract) is recorded at its estimated fair value each reporting period in 
Derivative asset
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with the change in the fair value recorded in 
Change in fair value of derivative asset
 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The requirements contract is not designated as a hedging instrument.
​
Kentucky Facility
In April 2021, the Company’s subsidiary, Block Mining, entered into the Kentucky PPA, a long-term power purchase agreement to provide power to one of its locations in Kentucky. Pursuant to the Kentucky PPA, the Company has the ability, but not the obligation, to acquire up to a total of 
60
 MW of power at one of its facilities through mid-April 2041. The all-in power rate includes a portion of the total fee that is at a fixed rate and another portion that adjusts annually. The Company determined the Kentucky PPA does not meet the definition of a derivative because it does not contain a notional amount. 
Under the Kentucky PPA, the Company may also elect not to utilize its long-term, fixed-price power for its operations, and instead elect to sell that power back into the MISO grid in exchange for credits against future power costs when there is a benefit to the Company, depending on the spot market price of electricity. The Company’s power strategy combines participation in Demand Response Services Programs and sales of power, to attempt to manage operating costs most efficiently.

The estimated fair values of the Rockdale PPA and Corsicana PPA are classified under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the significant unobservable inputs utilized in the valuation, which include the fixed price of each block for all 
345
 MW of power to be delivered per the Rockdale PPA and 
25
 MW of power to be delivered per the Corsicana PPA, discounted cash flow estimation models containing quoted commodity exchange spot and forward prices in mWh and are adjusted for basis spreads for load zone-to-hub differentials through the term of the Rockdale PPA, which is scheduled to end as of April 30, 2030, and the term of the Corsicana

PPA, which is scheduled to end as of December 31, 2027, and a discount rate of 
23.8
%. Actual power usage is not a variable input in the determination of the fair value as the price and quantity of power to be delivered per the Rockdale PPA and the Corsicana PPA are fixed despite the existence of multiple blocks with separate power amounts. 
The discount rate reflects the nature of the contract as it relates to the risk and uncertainty of the estimated future mark-to-market adjustments, forward price curves of the power supply, broker/dealer quotes, and other similar data obtained from quoted market prices or independent pricing vendors, risk-free rate of return, which is determined from United States Treasury Bond yields, estimated cost of debt, which includes a Moody’s rating, and an equity risk premium based upon market data provided by a global cost of capital service provider. The discount rate includes observable market inputs, but also includes unobservable inputs based on qualitative judgment related to Company credit risk.

Note 12. Debt
2030 Notes
In December 2024, the Company sold $
594.4
 million aggregate principal of 
0.75
% Convertible Senior Notes (the “2030 Notes”). Interest is payable semiannually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2025. The notes will mature on January 15, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted. 
Until July 15, 2029, the 2030 Notes may be converted at the option of the holder only upon the occurrence of certain events. On or after July 15, 2029, until the close of business on the second trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the 2030 Notes may be converted at the option of the holder at the conversion rate then in effect. The Company may not redeem the 2030 Notes prior to January 20, 2028, at which time the Company may redeem the 2030 Notes upon the occurrence of certain events.
The Company will settle any conversions of the 2030 Notes by paying or delivering cash, shares of common shares, or a combination of cash and shares of common shares, at the Company’s election. The 2030 Notes are convertible based upon an initial conversion rate of 
67.2767
 shares of the Company's common stocks per $
1,000
 principal amount of the 2030 Notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
14.86
 per share of Company common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain anti-dilutive events. 
The Company incurred $
15.2
 million of issuance costs related to the 2030 Notes, which it will amortize into 
Interest expense, (income) 
on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the term of the 2030 Notes. The 2030 Notes are recognized as long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, and as of December 31, 2024, the amount recognized was $
579.3
 million ($
594.4
 million principal less $
15.1
 million of unamortized debt issuance costs).
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $
0.2
 million of amortization of the deferred issuance costs. 
As of December 31, 2024, the 2030 Notes had an estimated fair value of approximately $
548.6
 million. The estimated fair value is based on quoted prices in an active market and valued at the closing price reported at the end of the period and thus represents a Level 1 measurement on the fair value hierarchy. 
Revolving Credit Facilities
$50 Million Credit Facility
In July 2024, the Company entered into a 
one-year
 $
50.0
 million Revolving Credit Facility (“$50 Million Credit Facility”). Revolving Loans borrowed by the Company under the $50 Million Credit Facility carry a per annum interest rate of 
1.25
% plus the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Letters of Credit issued under the $50 Million Credit Facility have a 
one-year
 term and incur fees of 
1.25
% per annum on the amount of Letters of Credit outstanding. Letters of Credit require the issuance of cash collateral by the Company equal to 
105
% of the Letter of Credit exposure. 
Concurrent with entry into the $50 Million Credit Facility, as required by the agreement, the Company funded the entire $
50.0
 million amount of the credit facility as security into a control account maintained by the lender to serve as collateral. The balance maintained in the control account is included in 
Restricted cash
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Variable interest, equal to approximately 
5.6
% per annum as of December 31, 2024, is earned by the Company on the amount held in the control account.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company issued $
8.4
 million in Letters of Credit against the $50 Million Credit Facility.
$20 Million Credit Facility
In August 2024, the Company entered into a 
two-year
 $
20.0
 million Revolving Credit Facility (“$20 Million Credit Facility”). Revolving Loans borrowed by the Company under the $20 Million Credit Facility carry a per annum interest rate of 
1.60
% plus the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Letters of Credit issued under the $20 Million Credit Facility have a 
one-year
 term and incur 
F-30

Table of Contents

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
fees of 
1.5
% per annum on the amount of Letters of Credit outstanding. Letters of Credit require the issuance of cash collateral by the Company equal to 
105
% of the Letter of Credit exposure. 
Concurrent with entry into the $20 Million Credit Facility, as required by the agreement, the Company funded the entire $
20.0
 million amount as security into a control account maintained by the lender to serve as collateral. The balance maintained in the control account is included in 
Restricted cash
 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Variable interest, equal to approximately 
3.96
% per annum as of December 31, 2024, is earned by the Company on the amount held in the control account.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company did 
no
t issue any Letters of Credit against the $20 Million Credit Facility.
Note Payable
As part of the Block Mining Acquisition, the Company 
assumed a 
$
5.7
 million note payable with a fixed rate of 
8.81
%
. The note matures in December 2035, with annual principal and accrued interest payments due beginning on December 31, 2024.

​
As of December, 31, 2024, the note payable had an estimated fair value of approximately $
5.1
 million. 
The fair value measurement of the note payable is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement on the fair value hierarchy. The significant assumptions used to estimate fair value of the convertible note as of December 31, 2024, primarily consisted of management’s best estimate of both the probability and timing of a conversion event and an interest rate range of 
8.9
%
 to 
10.5
%
, which reflected the issuance date spread premium over the selected yield for the remaining time to maturity. 
​
Credit and Security Facility
​
The Company’s subsidiary, ESS Metron,
 had a Credit and Security Facility Agreement, as amended, which provided for a $
10.0
 million credit and security facility consisting of a $
6.0
 million revolving line of credit (the “Revolving Line of Credit”) and a $
4.0
 million equipment guidance line (the “Equipment Guidance Line”). 
​
The Revolving Line of Credit matured in December 2024 and had interest due monthly and principal due at maturity. Upon maturity, the Revolving Line of Credit was not renewed or extended. All amounts borrowed under the Revolving Line of Credit carried a variable interest of not less than 
4.0
% and were secured by the assets of ESS Metron. There were 
no
 borrowings under the Revolving Line of Credit during the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance on the Revolving Line of Credit was $
0
.
​
The Equipment Guidance Line also matured in December 2024 and permitted the Company to finance up to 
80.0
% of certain equipment purchases. Upon maturity, the Equipment Guidance Line was not renewed or extended. All amounts borrowed under the Equipment Guidance Line carried a variable interest of not less than 
4.0
% and were secured by the assets of ESS Metron. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, there were 
no
 borrowings under the Equipment Guidance Line and
 approximately $
0.5
 million outstanding under the Equipment Guidance Line converted to a fixed rate term loan (see below). A
s of December 31, 2023, the outstanding balance on the Equipment Guidance Line was 
$
0.5
 million.
​
All borrowings and accrued interest under the Equipment Guidance Line converted to fixed rate term loans every six months, which had either 
five-year
 terms for borrowings used to acquire vehicles and manufacturing equipment (“Manufacturing Term Loans”) or 
three-year
 terms for borrowings of equipment other than vehicles and manufacturing equipment (“Equipment Term Loans”). The Manufacturing Term Loans made upon the first conversion of guidance line loans carried interest at a fixed rate equal to the five-year treasury rate plus 
2.5
% as of conversion and the Equipment Term Loans made upon the first conversion of guidance line loans carried interest at a fixed rate equal to the three-year treasury rate plus 
2.5
% as of conversion. All subsequent conversions to Manufacturing Term Loans and Equipment Term Loans carried interest at a fluctuating rate equal to the lender’s prime rate.

Note 15. Stock-Based Compensation
The 2019 Equity Incentive Plan authorizes the granting of stock-based compensation awards to directors, officers, employees, and advisors of the Company in the form of restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”), or stock options, all of which settle in shares of the Company’s common stock upon vesting. 
In July 2023, the Company adopted a new long-term incentive program under its 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, under which employees are eligible to receive performance-based RSAs or RSUs and service-based RSAs or RSUs. The performance-based awards are eligible to vest based on the relative performance of the Company’s common stock (“Total Stockholder Return” or “TSR”), compared to the performance of the Russell 3000 Index (the “Index TSR”), during the 
three-year
 performance period commencing as of the grant date of the TSR award (collectively, the “TSR Awards”). The TSR Awards have a vesting range of 
0
% to 
200
% of the recipient’s target award, which is calculated based on the difference between the Company’s TSR and the Index TSR over the three-year performance period, subject to the recipient’s continuous employment with the Company through the third anniversary of the award’s grant date. The service-based awards are eligible to vest in one-third annual installments over a three-year service period commencing on the award’s grant date, subject to the recipient’s continuous employment with the Company through the applicable vesting dates.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
14,666,096
 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan.

Assets and liabilities not measured at fair value on a recurring basis
In addition to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, we also measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Our non-financial assets, including goodwill, intangible assets, operating lease right of use assets, and property, plant and equipment, are measured at fair value when there is an indication of impairment and the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s projected undiscounted cash flows. These assets are recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, contract assets, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, contract liabilities, and accrued expenses approximated their carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.

Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
Miners and mining equipment
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company paid a total of $
555.9
 million in deposits and payments to MicroBT for the purchase of miners pursuant to the Master Agreement described herein. The remaining commitment of approximately $
1.0
 million due as of December 31, 2024, was paid in January 2025. 
Infrastructure
During 2024, the Company entered into agreements related to water supply infrastructure for the Corsicana Facility resulting in total remaining commitments of approximately $
16.8
 million. The Company expects to incur these costs throughout 2026.
Operating leases
The Company leases its primary office locations and Kentucky Facility data center and has a ground lease for its Rockdale Facility under noncancelable lease agreements that expire on varying dates through 2032. For additional information see Note 13. 
Leases
.
Water reservation agreement
The Company has a water reservation agreement, as amended, with the lessor of its ground lease to secure a certain quantity of non-potable water from a nearby lake to be used by the Company at the Rockdale Facility. The water reservation agreement runs through January 2032 and requires annual payments of approximately $
2.4
 million.
The Company concluded that the water reservation agreement was not a lease or a derivative instrument. Because the Company obtained an additional right of use for the reserved water amount, and the charges were increased by a standalone price commensurate with the additional water use rights and at market rates, the water reservation agreement was determined to be a lease modification accounted for as a separate contract. As such, the fees of the water reservation agreement were excluded from the lease payments of the ground lease and the water reservation agreement was accounted for as a separate executory contract.
Contingent consideration liabilities
Block Mining
As part of the Block Mining Acquisition, the sellers are eligible to earn an additional 
$
32.5
 million in potential earn-out targets, payable in cash or stock, if certain milestones are reached by December 31, 2025 (See Note 3. 
Acquisitions
). This contingent consideration was recognized as the acquisition date fair value of 
$
26.1
 million and is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in 
Contingent consideration liabilities, current portion. 
The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement on the fair value hierarchy. These inputs include management’s best estimate of both the probability and timing of achieving the milestones, a risk-free interest rate of approximately 5% based on the U.S. Treasury rate for the corresponding time periods and a credit spread of approximately 1% based on the median of Investment Grade High Yield Debt Instruments with a Standard & Poor’s BB credit rating. This credit rating was selected based on an independently-produced synthetic credit rating analysis.
As of December 31, 2024, the Block Mining contingent consideration had an estimated fair value of $
23.6
 million. 
E4A Solutions
As part of the E4A Solutions Acquisition, the sellers are eligible to earn potential earn-out targets based on E4A Solutions’ Adjusted EBITDA, calculated as 
2.65
 times the amount the average adjusted EBITDA exceeds the Earnout threshold, as defined in the purchase agreement, during the two years ending December 31, 2026, payable in cash or Riot common stock at the Company’s discretion. This contingent consideration was recognized as the acquisition date fair value of 
$
2.6
 million and is recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in 
Contingent consideration liabilities, less current portion. 
The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement on the fair value hierarchy
. These inputs include management’s best estimate of both the probability and timing of achieving the milestones, a risk-free interest rate of

approximately 4.25% based on the U.S. Treasury rate for the corresponding time periods and a credit spread of approximately 1% based on the median of Investment Grade and High Yield Debt Instruments with a Standard & Poor’s BB credit rating. This credit rating was selected based on an independently-produced synthetic credit rating analysis.
Whinstone
In February 2021, the State of Texas experienced an extreme and unprecedented winter weather event that resulted in prolonged freezing temperatures and caused an electricity generation shortage that was severely disruptive to the whole state. While demand for electricity reached extraordinary levels due to the extreme cold, the supply of electricity significantly decreased in part because of the inability of certain power generation facilities to supply electric power to the grid. Due to the extreme market price of electricity during this time, at the request of ERCOT, the Company stopped supplying power to its customers and instead sold power back to the grid.
In April 2021, under the provisions of the Rockdale PPA, and as a result of the weather event, the Company entered into a Qualified Scheduling Entity (“QSE”) Letter Agreement, which resulted in the Company being entitled to receive approximately $
125.1
 million for its power sales during the February winter storm, all under the terms and conditions of the QSE Letter Agreement. The Company received cash of $
29.0
 million in April 2021 (after deducting $
10.0
 million in power management fees owed by Whinstone), approximately $
59.7
 million was credited against power bills of the Company during 2022, with the remaining $
26.3
 million being contingent upon ERCOT’s future remittance. These amounts are recognized gross before fair value adjustments and expenses incurred by the Company for power management fees noted above and customer settlements. The fair value of the settlement agreement was estimated and recognized as an asset as part of acquisition accounting. 
As part of the acquisition of Whinstone, the Company is obligated to pay the seller up to $
86.0
 million, net of income taxes, (undiscounted) of additional consideration if certain power credits are received or realized by the Company arising from the February 2021 weather event. Upon the acquisition of Whinstone, the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration was approximately $
83.0
 million. 
The estimated fair value measurement is based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement.
Upon the acquisition of Whinstone, the Company estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration using a discounted cash flow analysis, which included estimates of both the timing and amounts of potential future power credits. These estimates were determined using the Company’s historical consumption quantities and patterns combined with management’s expectations of its future consumption requirements, which required significant judgment and depend on various factors outside the Company’s control, such as construction delays. The discount rate of approximately 
2.5
% included observable market inputs, but also included unobservable inputs such as interest rate spreads, which were estimated based on qualitative judgment related to company-specific risk factors. Specifically, the Company used S&P Global’s B credit rating in the yield curve to estimate a reasonable interest rate spread to determine the cost of debt input because the power credits are subordinated obligations of the Company’s counterparty. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events, the estimates could change significantly from period to period. 
Approximately 
$
1.2
 million of remaining future power 
credits
 to be received are estimated to be received over a period of 
12 years
. The Company determined the value of the contingent consideration as of December 31, 2024, using a discount rate of approximately 
8.0
%
, which was based on the factors above, including the recent increase in interest rates.

Legal Proceedings
The Company, and our subsidiaries, are subject at times to various claims, lawsuits and governmental proceedings relating to our business and transactions arising in the ordinary course of business. We cannot predict the final outcome of such proceedings. Where appropriate, we vigorously defend such claims, lawsuits and proceedings. Some of these claims, lawsuits and proceedings seek damages, including, direct, consequential, exemplary, and/or punitive damages, in amounts that could, if awarded, be significant. Certain of the claims, lawsuits and proceedings arising in ordinary course of business are covered by our insurance program. We maintain property, and various types of liability insurance in an effort to protect ourselves from such claims. In terms of any matters where there is no insurance coverage available to us, or where coverage is available and we maintain a retention or deductible associated with such insurance, we may establish an accrual for such loss, retention or deductible based on current available information. In accordance with accounting guidance, if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred as of the date of the financial statements, and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable, then an accrual for the cost to resolve or settle these claims is recorded by us on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If it is reasonably possible that an asset may be impaired as of the date of the financial statement, then we disclose the range of possible loss. Costs related to the defense of such claims are recorded by us as they are incurred. Management, with the assistance of outside counsel, may from time to time adjust such accruals according to new developments in the matter, court rulings, or changes in the strategy affecting our defense of such matters. On the basis of current information, we do not believe there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss, if any, will result from any claims, lawsuits and proceedings to which we are subject to either individually, or in the aggregate.  
Green Revolution Cooling Patent Dispute 
On March 22, 2024, GRC filed a complaint against the Company in Case No. 6:24-CV-152 in the Western District of Texas for patent infringement. More specifically, GRC has alleged that the immersion cooling systems provided to the Company by third parties infringe GRC’s U.S. Patent Nos. 9,992,914 (“the ’914 Patent”) and 10,123,463 (“the ’463 Patent”). In the complaint, GRC seeks unspecified damages and an injunction against all products that allegedly infringe the ’914 Patent and the ’463 Patent (or in lieu of an injunction, an award of a compulsory forward royalty). The Company has engaged counsel and is working with its counsel to evaluate and defend the Company from this infringement claim. While a preliminary investigation of GRC’s claims is underway, the Company cannot reasonably predict the outcome of such ongoing litigation, or the magnitude of such outcome, at this time.

Northern Data Working Capital Disputes

​
On September 7, 2022, the Company filed a complaint against Northern Data AG (“Northern Data”) in the Delaware Court of Chancery (Case No. C.A. No. 2022-0792-LWW) disputing the purchase price of Whinstone and seeking declaratory relief and specific performance of the stock purchase agreement.  On March 31, 2023, the parties filed a stipulation agreeing to dismiss all claims without prejudice and to submit the dispute for final determination to an independent accountant.  The Company placed approximately

$
29.5

million in escrow pending the final determination of the independent accountant, and, on June 9, 2023, the independent accountant rendered a written final determination finding in favor of the Company on disputed issues totaling approximately

$
27.1

million.  Accordingly, approximately

$
27.1

million of the escrowed amount was released from escrow and distributed to the Company on June 13, 2023, with the remaining approximately

$
2.4

million held in escrow allocated to Northern Data.  As a result, the Company recognized a Deferred gain on acquisition post-close dispute settlement of

$
26.0

million on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
​
Following the final determination, Northern Data filed a complaint against the Company in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the “Chancery Court”) on June 23, 2023 (Case No. C.A. No. 2023-0650-LWW) challenging the independent accountant’s written final determination and seeking to

re-litigate the purchase price adjustment process.  The Company contests the legal and factual basis of Northern Data’s claims and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on July 17, 2023, which the Chancery Court heard on February 13, 2024.  The Chancery Court denied the motion to dismiss on May 17, 2024, at which time the court advised the parties that summary judgment briefing after focused discovery may be a worthwhile endeavor.  Both the Company and Northern Data moved for summary judgment on November 6, 2024. On February 17, 2025, the Chancery Court heard the parties motions for summary judgment and took the matter under advisement. The Chancery Court has not yet issued a ruling on the motions. While the Company intends to vigorously oppose such complaint, the Company cannot accurately predict the outcome of the ongoing litigation, estimate the magnitude of such outcome, or forecast when such litigation will be resolved, at this time

Legacy Hosting Customer Disputes 

Rhodium 

On May 2, 2023, Whinstone filed a petition against Rhodium 30MW, LLC (“Rhodium 30MW”), Rhodium JV, LLC (“Rhodium JV”), Air HPC LLC (“Air HPC”), and Jordan HPC, LLC (“Jordan HPC” and, together with Rhodium 30MW, Rhodium JV, and Air HPC, collectively, the “Defendants”) in Case No. CV41873 in the 20th District Court (the “District Court”) of Milam County, Texas. In its amended petition filed May 3, 2023, Whinstone asserted breach of contract claims for Rhodium JV and Air HPC’s failure to pay certain hosting and service fees under the now-terminated Whinstone-Rhodium hosting agreements (“Hosting Agreements”) and sought a declaration regarding the rights and obligations under certain hosting agreements with the Defendants and that no power credits are owed to any Rhodium entity under any agreement. Whinstone sought recovery of more than $
26

million, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, expenses, and pre- and post-judgment interest. On June 12, 2023, Defendants answered and, along with non-parties Rhodium Encore LLC, Rhodium 2.0 LLC, and Rhodium 10mw LLC (collectively, the “Rhodium Non-Parties” and, together with Defendants, collectively, “Rhodium”), filed contingent counterclaims for breach of contract and moved to compel arbitration for alleged unpaid energy sale credits and lost profits. On August 14, 2023, Whinstone filed a second amended petition to include a declaration regarding the rights and obligations under the now-terminated water agreement between Whinstone and various Rhodium entities. 
​
On September 13, 2023, the District Court compelled Whinstone’s claims against Defendants to arbitration over Whinstone’s objection and stayed the lawsuit pending such arbitration. 
​
On December 11, 2023, Rhodium submitted an arbitration demand to the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), seeking damages and specific performance of unspecified contracts. Rhodium amended its demand on June 4, 2024 to include additional claims and disclosed it seeks at least $
67

million in damages. Whinstone does not believe Rhodium’s claims have any merit, and will vigorously contest such claims, as appropriate. Whinstone objected to the AAA’s jurisdiction and authority to entertain the claims and decide any issues of arbitrability. Subject to those objections, Whinstone submitted counterclaims to the AAA on December 29, 2023 against Rhodium JV and Air HPC for breach of contract, seeking recovery of at least $
20

million in past-due revenue share payments, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, expenses, and pre- and post-judgment interest.
​
After a permanent arbitrator was appointed and written discovery commenced, Rhodium filed for bankruptcy protection on August 24, 2024 and August 29, 2024 in a now jointly administered proceeding styled 
In re: Rhodium Encore LLC, et al.
, Case No. 24-90448 (ARP), in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas—Houston Division (the "Bankruptcy Court"). Therein, Rhodium filed a motion to assume the Hosting Agreements, and the Bankruptcy Court set a contested hearing on the matter for November 12-29, 2024. 
​
On October 3, 2024, Whinstone filed a motion for partial summary judgment and on October 16, 2024, Rhodium filed its own motion for partial summary judgment.  The Bankruptcy Court denied both motions on November 8, 2024. From November 11, 2024 to November 14, 2024, the Bankruptcy Court heard phase one of Rhodium's Motion to Assume, which the Court granted in an interim order on December 16, 2024.  Phase two of Rhodium’s Motion to Assume is set for February 26, 2025. The Company anticipates appealing the Bankruptcy Court’s decision and cannot reasonably predict the outcome of such ongoing proceedings, or the magnitude of such an outcome, at this time.  
​
On February 11, 2025, Rhodium Encore LLC, Rhodium JV LLC, Rhodium 30MW LLC, Rhodium 2.0 LLC, Rhodium 10MW LLC, Air HPC LLC, Jordan HPC LLC, Rhodium Industries LLC and Rhodium Renewables LLC (collectively, "Plaintiffs") filed a complaint against Riot and Whinstone in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. Plaintiffs allege damages for breach of contract and tortious interference, and requests an application for permanent injunctive relief seeking more than $300 million in damages. Riot and Whinstone believe Plaintiff's claims are without merit and intends to vigorously contest them, as appropriate. Because this litigation is still at this early stage, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the magnitude of such an outcome, if any.
​
SBI Crypto Co.

On April 5, 2023, SBI Crypto Co., Ltd. (“SBI”) filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas (Case No. 6:23-cv-252), which it later amended, against Whinstone alleging breach of contract, fraud, and negligent bailment claims related to a colocation services agreement between Whinstone and SBI that was terminated in 2021. On July 21, 2023, Whinstone filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which was denied on October 25, 2023. SBI seeks recovery of at least $
15.0

million in lost profits and at least $
16.0

million for equipment damage, plus reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs, expenses, costs, and pre-

and post-judgment interest. Whinstone believes many of the claims are barred or waived, and that all of SBI’s claims substantively lack merit, and Whinstone plans to vigorously contest the same, as appropriate. While a preliminary investigation of the merits of SBI’s claims has commenced and because this litigation is still at this early stage, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome of such ongoing litigation, or the magnitude of such an outcome, at this time.  

GMO 
​
On June 13, 2022, GMO Gamecenter USA, Inc. and its parent, GMO Internet Group, Inc., (collectively “GMO”) filed a complaint against Whinstone alleging breach of a colocation services agreement between GMO and Whinstone, which has since been terminated, seeking damages in excess of $
150.0

million for lost profit and profit sharing payments GMO alleges it was owed from Whinstone. The case is pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Case No. 1:22-cv-05974-JPC). Whinstone has responded to GMO’s claims and raised counterclaims of its own, alleging GMO itself breached the colocation services agreement, seeking a declaratory judgment and damages in excess of $
25.0

million. On October 19, 2023, GMO filed its fourth amended complaint claiming an additional $
496.0

million in damages, for loss of future profits and future profit sharing payments GMO alleges would have been received through the term of the agreement, based on Whinstone’s allegedly wrongful termination of the colocation services agreement as of June 29, 2023. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome of such ongoing litigation, or the magnitude of such an outcome, at this time.

The Company has approximately $
896.0
 million and $
289.0
 million of federal and state tax Net Operating Losses (“NOLs”), respectively, that may be available to offset future taxable income. Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $
130.0
 million and $
159.0
 million, respectively, if not utilized, expire between 2026 and 2037. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, $
766.0
 million federal and $
130.0
 million state NOLs incurred after December 31, 2017 are carried forward indefinitely, but may be limited in utilization to 80% of taxable income. 
Furthermore, as a result of changes in the ownership of our common stock and changes in our business operations, our ability to use our federal and state NOLs may be subject to annual limitations limited under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 and 383. The annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before they are able to be utilized. The Company does not expect any previous ownership changes, as defined under Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, to result in an ultimate limitation that will materially reduce the total amount of net operating loss carryforwards and credits that can be utilized.
The statute of limitations for assessment by the IRS and state tax authorities is open for tax years ending December 31, 2018 through 2023, although carryforward attributes that were generated prior to tax year 2018 may still be adjusted upon examination by the IRS or state tax authorities if they either have been or will be used in a future period. Currently, no federal or state income tax returns are under examination by the respective taxing authorities.
In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and taxing strategies in making this assessment. In case the deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods, the Company has provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The valuation allowance decreased by approximately $
53.0
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Note 20. Segment Information
The Company has 
two
 reportable segments: Bitcoin Mining and Engineering. The reportable segments are identified based on the types of service performed. No operating segments have been aggregated to form the reportable segments.
Gross profit (loss) is the segment performance measure the CODM uses to assess the Company’s reportable segments, and is before elimination of intersegment profits. 
Prior to 2024, the Company had a Data Center Hosting reportable segment but has since terminated all contracts with its Data Center Hosting customers. Commencing with the three months ended March 31, 2024, the CODM ceased analyzing the performance of the Data Center Hosting operations and the Company ceased reporting Data Center Hosting as a separate reportable business segment. The Company has no plans to offer data center hosting services to new customers. All residual revenue and costs of revenue related to Data Center Hosting incurred during the year ended December 31, 2024, are included in 
Revenue: Other 
and 
Cost of Revenue: Other. 
Prior period amounts related to Data Center Hosting have been recast into 
Revenue: Other 
and 
Cost of Revenue: Other
. 
Other than the $
96.9
 million of goodwill from the Block Mining Acquisition allocated to the Bitcoin Mining segment, and $
25.0
 million of goodwill from the E4A Solutions Acquisition allocated to the Engineering segment, the Company does not allocate assets 
F-46

Riot Platforms, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
to the reporting segments because its assets are managed on an entity-wide basis and, therefore, does not separately disclose the total assets of its reportable operating segments. 
The Bitcoin Mining segment generates revenue from the Bitcoin the Company earns through its Bitcoin Mining activities. The Engineering segment generates revenue through customer contracts for custom engineered electrical products. All
 Revenue: Other revenue
 is from external customers.
All revenue and cost of revenue from intersegment transactions have been eliminated in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

ITEM 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
As of May 18, 2023, the Company dismissed Marcum LLP (“Marcum”) as its independent registered public accounting firm, not as a result of any disagreement on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or audit scope or procedure.
​
During the Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, as well as the subsequent interim periods through Marcum’s dismissal, there were no disagreements within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K with Marcum on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to Marcum’s satisfaction, would have caused Marcum to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its reports on the Company’s financial statements for such fiscal years. There was a reportable event within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, taking the form of an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting related to the existence of a material weakness for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Specifically, Marcum’s report contained an adverse opinion regarding the Company’s control pertaining to the review of its Bitcoin for potential impairment
.
​
ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2024, to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.
Based on this evaluation, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024.
​
Changes in internal control
We periodically review our internal control over financial reporting as part of our efforts to ensure compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting to identify potential changes to our processes and systems that may improve controls and increase efficiency, with the goal of establishing and maintaining an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating the activities of business units, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations, formalizing policies and procedures, improving segregation of duties and increasing monitoring controls. 
In July and December 2024, we acquired 100% of the equity interests of Block Mining and E4A Solutions, respectively. The Company has not yet completed an assessment of the design and/or operating effectiveness of Block Mining or E4A Solutions’ internal control over financial reporting. As part of our ongoing integration activities, we are incorporating our controls and procedures into these recently acquired businesses. 
Other than those changes made in connection with the acquisitions of Block Mining and E4A Solutions, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We are currently in the process of integrating the Block Mining and E4A Solutions operations, control processes, and information systems into our systems and control environment and expect to include them in the scope of design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting for the year ending December 31, 2025. We believe that we have taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting during this integration.

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Our management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the internal controls of Block Mining and E4A Solutions, which we acquired in July and December of 2024, respectively, and whose financial statements represent, on a combined basis, 5.8% of our consolidated total assets and 0.6% of our consolidated total revenue as of and for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. We are currently in the process of integrating the Block Mining and E4A Solutions operations, control processes, and information systems into our systems and control environment and expect to include them in the scope of design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting for the year ending December 31, 2025. We believe that we have taken the necessary steps to monitor and maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting during this integration.
​
Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management utilized the criteria established in the Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Based on our management’s assessment and those criteria, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an audit report on management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The report of Deloitte & Touche LLP is included below in this Item 9A. controls and Procedures under the heading “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting”.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Riot Platforms, Inc. 
​
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
​
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Riot Platforms, Inc. (the “Company”) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
As described in Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Block Mining, Inc. and E4A Solutions, LLC, which were acquired on July 23, 2024 and December 16, 2024, respectively, and whose financial statements constitute 5.8% of the consolidated total assets and 0.6% of the consolidated total revenue of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Block Mining, Inc. and E4A Solutions, LLC.
Basis for Opinion

​
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
