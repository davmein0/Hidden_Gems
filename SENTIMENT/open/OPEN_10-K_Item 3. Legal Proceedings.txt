Overview
Opendoor’s mission is to power life’s progress, one move at a time. Residential real estate is a trillion-dollar industry underpinned by a process that is complicated, time-consuming, stressful, and offline. We believe all consumers deserve to buy, sell, and move between homes with simplicity and confidence, and we have dedicated over a decade to delivering on this vision. We have built unique pricing and operations capabilities to become one of the largest buyers and sellers of homes in the United States. Since our founding, we have helped customers to buy or sell homes in over 274,000 transactions and have expanded our footprint to 50 markets across the country.

Current Housing Environment
Throughout 2024, the U.S. housing market faced persistent headwinds as elevated mortgage rates, affordability constraints, and supply-demand imbalances weighed on market activity. Mortgage rates remained volatile, with brief periods of relief followed by rate reversions that reinforced sluggish market conditions. 
45

(Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share data and ratios, or as noted)
Housing market activity remained subdued, with 2024 seasonally adjusted annual home sales coming in at just over four million units – well below the decade average of over five million. The ongoing lock-in effect, where homeowners with low fixed-rate mortgages are reluctant to sell, continued to constrain supply, while elevated borrowing costs weighed on buyer affordability. Against this backdrop, delistings – homes removed from the market unsold – continued to climb throughout the year, reflecting a persistent disconnect between seller expectations and buyer willingness to transact.
By mid-year, month-over-month home price appreciation (“HPA”) had turned negative earlier than in any year in the last decade outside of 2020. A brief period of declining mortgage rates in the fall spurred a temporary uptick in demand and HPA, but as rates rebounded, demand and home price appreciation reverted back to negative territory.
We continue to operate with a flexible approach, dynamically adjusting pricing strategies to balance growth, margin, and risk. We will continue to monitor macroeconomic signals, and we remain nimble in our decision making so that we can capitalize on shifts in interest rates and market conditions.
Factors Affecting our Business Performance
Market Penetration in Existing Markets
Residential real estate is one of the largest consumer markets in the United States, of which less than 1% of the estimated $1.7 trillion of home value transacted annually is conducted online. Given the fact that we operate in a highly fragmented industry and offer a differentiated value proposition to the traditional offline selling process, we believe there is significant opportunity to expand our share in our existing markets. By providing a consistent, high-quality and differentiated experience to our customers, we hope to continue to drive positive word-of-mouth awareness and trust in our platform.
We are steadily growing our reach via our partnership channels with homebuilders, agents, and online real estate platforms. We have relationships with two of the largest online real estate platforms, Zillow and Redfin, which together reach millions of unique monthly visitors. We launched our partnership with Zillow, Inc. in early 2023, allowing home sellers on the Zillow, Inc. platform to request an offer directly from Opendoor. In addition to driving incremental acquisitions, we expect these partnerships can build our brand awareness and serve as additional avenues for sellers to learn about the benefits of our flagship cash offer.
A continued source of opportunity is re-engagement with our base of registered sellers, meaning sellers that have received an offer from Opendoor but have not yet sold their home. In the last ten years, we have sent millions of offers and, while not everyone is ready to act when they request an offer, we treat everyone as a potential future seller. We perpetually iterate on our re-engagement strategies and believe that our registered customer base will continue to be an important source of home acquisition volumes.

Due to the deteriorating macro environment in 2022, 2023, and 2024, we paused our new market expansion plans and are continually assessing areas within our existing markets to expand. 
Adjacent Services
We believe home sellers and buyers value simplicity and certainty. To that end, we are building an online, integrated suite of home services, which currently includes title insurance, escrow services and real estate brokerage services. 
Our success with title insurance and escrow services helps validate our view that customers prefer an online, integrated experience. 
We will continue to evaluate new ways to improve our end-to-end solution and expect to invest in additional

(Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share data and ratios, or as noted)
adjacent products and services over time with the expectation that these adjacent services will continue to improve our unit economics.
Unit Economics
We view Contribution Margin as a key measure of unit economic performance. Contribution Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “—
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
” for further details and a reconciliation of Contribution Margin to gross margin.

Our long-term financial performance depends, in part, on continuing to maintain and expand unit margins through the following initiatives:
•
Optimization and enhancements of our pricing engine; 
•
Platform efficiency improvements through greater automation and self-service;
•
Incremental attach of services, which supplement the core transaction margin profile; and
•
Expansion of our List with Opendoor and Opendoor Marketplace product offerings, which will reduce our inventory exposure and capital intensity, and eliminate the holding and selling costs associated with taking ownership of the home.
Inventory Management
Effectively managing our overall inventory position and balancing growth, margin, and risk are critical to our financial performance. Since our inception, we have prioritized investment in our pricing capabilities across our home acquisition processes and our forecasting and resale systems, and will continue to do so. As part of our overall risk management framework, we consider both individual market and aggregate portfolio exposures. We typically seek to maximize the resale margin performance of our inventory in the context of managing overall risk and inventory health through monitoring sell-through rates, holding periods, and portfolio aging, and we will adjust down listed prices on our inventory when appropriate to stay in-line with market sell-through rates and drive resale clearance. We also adjust the spreads embedded in our offers to respond to current market conditions, both at a macro and local level. (Spreads are defined as total discount to our home valuation at time of offer less the Opendoor service fee of 5%.) 
Real estate inventory is reviewed for valuation adjustments on a quarterly basis. If the carrying amount for a given home is not expected to be recovered, an inventory valuation adjustment is recorded to cost of revenue and the home’s carrying value is adjusted to its net realizable value. Inventory valuation adjustments are not offset by any expected gains and are not reversed or adjusted should the expected net realizable value subsequently increase. We recorded inventory valuation adjustments of $57 million and $65 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See “—
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Real Estate Inventory”
 for a detailed discussion of inventory valuation adjustments.
As one key measure of inventory management performance, we evaluate our portfolio metrics relative to the broader market (as observed on the multiple listing services (“MLS”)). One such metric is our percentage of homes “on the market” for greater than 120 days as measured from initial listing date. As of December 31, 2024, such homes represented 46% of our portfolio, compared to 25% for the broader market when filtered for the types of homes we are able to underwrite and acquire based on characteristics such as market, price range, home type, home location, year built and lot size (which we refer to as our “buybox”). This metric fluctuates based on seasonal factors, market dynamics, and our resale strategies. In the fourth quarter, we implemented fewer home-level price reductions as the market slowed, opting not to sell inventory into a low-demand environment. Meanwhile, delistings continued to rise, with over one in four home sellers removing their listings from the MLS rather than going into contract. The combination of slower price reductions and rising delistings resulted in longer listing times compared to market participants who took a more aggressive pricing approach or were willing to delist their homes from the market. Additionally, beginning in mid-May, we intentionally slowed our home acquisition pace in response to our risk management objectives and broader macroeconomic uncertainty. When newly acquired homes represent a smaller proportion of our overall inventory, average days on market for our portfolio generally increases.
Inventory Financing
Our business model is working capital intensive and inventory financing is a key enabler of our growth. We primarily rely on our access to non-recourse asset-backed debt, which consists of asset-backed senior debt facilities and asset-backed 
47

(Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share data and ratios, or as noted)
mezzanine term debt facilities, to finance our home acquisitions. See “—
Liquidity and Capital Resources — Debt and Financing Arrangements.
”
Seasonality
The residential real estate market is seasonal, with greater demand and home price appreciation from home buyers in the spring and summer, and typically weaker demand and lower home price appreciation in late fall and winter. In general, we expect our financial results and working capital requirements to reflect seasonal variations over time. However, other factors, including growth, market expansion and changes in macroeconomic conditions, such as rising inflation and interest rate increases, have obscured the impact of seasonality in our historical financials and we expect may continue to do so.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to our results of operations below, we report certain financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
These measures have limitations as analytical tools when assessing our operating performance and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures, including gross profit and net loss. We may calculate or present our non-GAAP financial measures differently than other companies who report measures with similar titles and, as a result, the non-GAAP financial measures we report may not be comparable with those of companies in our industry or in other industries.
Adjusted Gross Profit and Contribution Profit (Loss)
To provide investors with additional information regarding our margins and return on inventory acquired, we have included Adjusted Gross Profit and Contribution Profit (Loss), which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that Adjusted Gross Profit and Contribution Profit (Loss) are useful financial measures for investors as they are supplemental measures used by management in evaluating unit level economics and our operating performance. Each of these measures is intended to present the economics related to homes sold during a given period. We do so by including revenue generated from homes sold (and adjacent services) in the period and only the expenses that are directly attributable to such home sales, even if such expenses were recognized in prior periods, and excluding expenses related to homes that remain in inventory as of the end of the period. Contribution Profit (Loss) provides investors a measure to assess Opendoor’s ability to generate returns on homes sold during a reporting period after considering home purchase costs, renovation and repair costs, holding costs and selling costs. 
Adjusted Gross Profit and Contribution Profit (Loss) are supplemental measures of our operating performance and have limitations as analytical tools. For example, these measures include costs that were recorded in prior periods under GAAP and exclude, in connection with homes held in inventory at the end of the period, costs required to be recorded under GAAP in the same period. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We include a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is gross profit.
Adjusted Gross Profit / Margin
We calculate Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit under GAAP adjusted for (1) inventory valuation adjustment in the current period and (2) inventory valuation adjustment in prior periods. Inventory valuation adjustment in the current period is calculated by adding back the inventory valuation adjustments recorded during the period on homes that remain in inventory at period end. Inventory valuation adjustment in prior periods is calculated by subtracting the inventory valuation adjustments recorded in prior periods on homes sold in the current period. Adjusted Gross Margin is Adjusted Gross Profit as a percentage of revenue. See “—
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates — Real Estate Inventory”
 for a detailed discussion of inventory valuation adjustments.
We view this metric as an important measure of business performance as it captures gross margin performance isolated to homes sold in a given period and provides comparability across reporting periods. Adjusted Gross Profit helps management assess home pricing, service fees and renovation performance for a specific resale cohort.

Contribution Profit / Margin
We calculate Contribution Profit (Loss) as Adjusted Gross Profit, minus certain costs incurred on homes sold during the current period including: (1) holding costs incurred in the current period, (2) holding costs incurred in prior periods, and (3) direct selling costs. Contribution Margin is Contribution Profit (Loss) as a percentage of revenue.
We view this metric as an important measure of business performance as it captures the unit level performance isolated to homes sold in a given period and provides comparability across reporting periods. Contribution Profit (Loss) helps management assess inflows and outflows directly associated with a specific resale cohort.

Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA

These measures are also commonly used by investors and analysts to compare the underlying performance of companies in our industry. We believe these measures provide investors with

meaningful period over period comparisons of our underlying performance, adjusted for certain charges that are non-cash, not directly related to our revenue-generating operations, not aligned to related revenue, or not reflective of ongoing operating results that vary in frequency and amount.
Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of our operating performance and have important limitations. For example, these measures exclude the impact of certain costs required to be recorded under GAAP. These measures also include inventory valuation adjustments that were recorded in prior periods under GAAP and exclude, in connection with homes held in inventory at the end of the period, inventory valuation adjustments required to be recorded under GAAP in the same period. These measures could differ substantially from similarly titled measures presented by other companies in our industry or companies in other industries. Accordingly, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We include a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, which is net loss.
Adjusted Net Loss
We calculate Adjusted Net Loss as GAAP net loss adjusted to exclude non-cash expenses of stock-based compensation, equity securities fair value adjustment, and intangibles amortization expense. It excludes expenses that are not directly related to our revenue-generating operations such as restructuring and legal contingency accruals. It excludes loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt as these expenses or gains were incurred as a result of decisions made by management to repay portions of our outstanding credit facilities and the 0.25% convertible senior notes due in 2026 (the "2026 Notes") early; these expenses are not reflective of ongoing operating results and vary in frequency and amount. It also excludes goodwill impairment. Adjusted Net Loss also aligns the timing of inventory valuation adjustments recorded under GAAP to the period in which the related revenue is recorded in order to improve the comparability of this measure to our non-GAAP financial measures of unit economics, as described above. Our calculation of Adjusted Net Loss does not currently include the tax effects of the non-GAAP adjustments because our taxes and such tax effects have not been material to date.
Adjusted EBITDA / Margin
We calculated Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted Net Loss adjusted for depreciation and amortization, property financing and other interest expense, interest income, and income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental performance measure that our management uses to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue.

Components of Our Results of Operations
Revenue
We generate the majority of our revenue from the sale of homes that we previously acquired from homeowners. In addition, we generate revenue from additional services we provide to both home sellers and buyers, which consists primarily of title insurance and escrow services and brokerage services.
Home sales revenue from selling residential real estate is recognized when title to and possession of the property has transferred to the buyer and we have no continuing involvement with the property, which is generally the close of escrow. The amount of revenue recognized for each home sale is equal to the sale price of the home net of any concessions.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue includes the property purchase price, acquisition costs and direct costs to renovate or repair the home. These costs are accumulated in real estate inventory during the property holding period and charged to cost of revenue under the specific identification method when the property is sold. Real estate inventory is reviewed for valuation adjustments at least quarterly. If the carrying amount for a given home is not expected to be recovered, an inventory valuation adjustment is recorded to cost of revenue and the home’s carrying value is adjusted to its net realizable value. Additionally, for our revenue other than home sales revenue, cost of revenue consists of any costs incurred in delivering the service, including associated headcount expenses such as salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation.
Operating Expenses
Sales, Marketing and Operations Expense
Sales, marketing and operations expense consists primarily of broker commissions (paid to the home buyers’ real estate agents and third-party listing agents, if applicable), resale closing costs, holding costs related to real estate inventory including utilities, property taxes and maintenance, and expenses associated with product marketing, promotions and brand-building. Sales, marketing and operations expense also includes any headcount expenses in support of sales, marketing, and real estate operations such as salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation.
General and Administrative Expense
General and administrative expense consists primarily of headcount expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our executive, finance, human resources, legal and administrative personnel, third-party professional services fees and rent expense.
Technology and Development Expense
Technology and development expense consists primarily of headcount expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for employees in the design, development, testing, maintenance and operation of our websites, tools, applications, and mobile apps that support our products. Technology and development expense also includes amortization of capitalized software development costs and third-party software and hosting costs.
Goodwill Impairment Expense
Goodwill impairment expense consists of impairment charges recorded as a result of goodwill impairment testing. 
Restructuring Expense

incurred during the restructuring process. See “
Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 20. Restructuring”
 for additional information regarding restructuring expenses.
(Loss) Gain on Extinguishment of Debt
(Loss) gain on extinguishment of debt is primarily related to the Company’s partial repurchase of the 2026 Notes at a discount net of unamortized deferred costs associated with the 2026 Notes. Gain on extinguishment of debt also includes any gains or losses recognized in conjunction with the termination of debt facilities, partial debt extinguishments, and unamortized deferred costs associated with these facilities. See “
Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 5. Credit Facilities and Long-Term Debt—Convertible Senior Notes”
 for additional information regarding the 2026 Notes.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists primarily of interest paid or payable and the amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs. Interest expense varies period over period, primarily due to fluctuations in our inventory volumes and changes in the floating benchmark interest rates (“Benchmark Rates”), based on the secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”), plus an applicable margin, which impact the interest incurred on our senior revolving credit facilities (see “— 
Liquidity and Capital Resources — Debt and Financing Arrangements
”).
We expect our overall interest expense to increase as inventory increases. Subject to market conditions and cost of capital trade-offs, we will evaluate opportunities to expand our sources of financing over time, which may allow us to diversify our mix of financing sources to include more cost-effective financing relative to our higher cost mezzanine term debt facilities.
Other Income (Loss) — Net
Other income (loss) 
– 
net consists primarily of interest income on our Cash and Restricted cash balances and from our investment in money market funds, time deposits, and debt securities as well as changes in fair value of, and dividend income, from our investment in equity securities, and gains from deconsolidation.
Income Tax Expense
We record income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. We recognize the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.

Revenue
Revenue decreased by $1.8 billion, or 26%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes during the year ended December 31, 2024. We sold 13,593 homes during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 18,708 homes during the year ended December 31, 2023, representing a decrease of 27%. Revenue per home sold increased 2% between the same periods. The decrease in sales volumes was primarily attributable to proactively slowing inventory acquisitions beginning in the third quarter of 2022 in reaction to volatility in the U.S. housing market coupled with a focus on clearing existing inventory, which had reached peak levels in 2022. The Company entered 2024 with 5,326 homes in inventory as compared to 12,788 homes in inventory at the start of 2023, representing a 58% decrease in homes available for resale.
Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit
Cost of revenue decreased by $1.7 billion, or 27%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes.
Gross profit decreased from $487 million to $433 million and gross margin increased from 7.0% to 8.4% for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024, respectively. For the same periods, Adjusted Gross Margin increased from 0.8% to 8.4% and Contribution Margin increased from (3.7)% to 4.7%. The decrease in gross profit was attributable to lower sales volumes as discussed above. The increase in gross margin, Adjusted Gross Margin and Contribution Margin reflects relative home price stabilization and higher spreads embedded in our acquisition offers beginning in the third quarter of 2022. As a reminder, Adjusted Gross Margin and Contribution Margin include inventory valuation adjustments recorded in prior periods on homes sold in the current period and exclude inventory valuation adjustments on homes remaining in inventory at the end of the period, which can create significant differences between these metrics and Gross margin. Adjusted Gross Margin and Contribution Margin for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024 are inclusive of $455 million and $26 million, respectively, of inventory valuation adjustments recorded in prior periods on homes sold in the current period. Adjusted Gross Margin and Contribution Margin are non-GAAP financial measures. See “— 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
” for further details and a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures.

Operating Expenses
Sales, Marketing and Operations
. Sales, marketing and operations decreased by $73 million, or 15%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $65 million decrease in resale transaction costs and broker commissions, consistent with the 26% decrease in revenue during the same period. In addition, during the same period, headcount expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, decreased $21 million, primarily due to workforce reductions and the transition of certain roles to lower-cost geographies. Advertising expense increased by $11 million, from $75 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $86 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.
General and Administrative
. General and administrative decreased by $24 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $8 million decrease in depreciation expense as we slowed our pace of fixed assets additions and existing assets became fully depreciated. In addition, headcount expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, decreased $8 million, primarily due to workforce reductions and the transition of certain roles to lower-cost geographies. Rent expense decreased by $3 million, driven by partial terminations of leases and subleases. 
Technology and Development
. Technology and development decreased by $26 million, or 16%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a $39 million reduction in headcount expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, resulting from workforce reductions and the transition of certain roles to lower-cost geographies. Additionally, amortization of intangibles from past acquisitions declined by $3 million. These cost reductions were partially offset by a $17 million net increase in expenses related to internally developed software, reflecting lower capitalization of development costs and increased amortization expenses, partially offset by a decrease in impairment expense. 
Restructuring.
 Restructuring increased by $3 million, or 21%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was attributable to the Company’s reduction in force announced on November 7, 2024 as well as the termination of certain non-cancelable leases and consulting fees incurred during the restructuring process. 
(Loss) Gain on Extinguishment of Debt
(Loss) gain on extinguishment of debt decreased by $218 million, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The gain on extinguishment of debt of $216 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 resulted from the Company’s partial repurchase of its 2026 Notes at a discount, net of unamortized deferred costs associated with the 2026 Notes. This gain was partially offset by expenses related to partial debt extinguishments during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased by $78 million, or 37%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a significant decrease in average balances in our non-recourse asset-backed debt and a decrease in loan fees as a result of committed debt reductions.
Other Income — Net
Other income – net decreased by $43 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily related to a $53 million decrease in interest income due to a reduction in the average cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balances and a $7 million unrealized loss versus a $4 million unrealized gain on marketable equity securities during the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease was partially offset by the $14 million gain from the deconsolidation of Mainstay. See “
Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 16. Deconsolidation”
 for additional information regarding the deconsolidation of Mainstay.

Revenue
Revenue decreased by $8.6 billion, or 55%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes as well as lower revenue per home. We sold 18,708 homes during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 39,183 homes during the year ended December 31, 2022, representing a decrease of 52%. Revenue per home sold decreased 7% between the same periods. The decrease in sales volumes was a result of the proactive reduction of our inventory acquisition pace beginning in the third quarter of 2022 via higher spreads embedded in our offers and lower marketing investment in reaction to volatility in the U.S. housing market. The decrease in revenue per home sold was primarily attributed to a slowdown in home price appreciation (“HPA”).
Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit
Cost of revenue decreased by $8.4 billion, or 57%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes and a 9% decrease in cost of revenue per home, excluding inventory valuation adjustments on homes in inventory at period end, due to the slowdown in inventory acquisition pacing and HPA discussed above. In addition, the decrease in cost of revenue is attributable to a decrease in inventory valuation adjustments on homes in inventory at period end, which were $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to $458 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in inventory valuation adjustments reflects the relative home price stabilization experienced in 2023 as well as higher spreads embedded in our home acquisition offers.
Gross profit decreased from $667 million to $487 million and gross margin increased from 4.3% to 7.0% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease in gross profit is attributable to lower sales volumes as discussed above as well as the strong margins realized during the first half of the year ended December 31, 2022, which were fueled by a historically strong U.S. housing market at the start of the year. The increase in gross margin for the year

ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 is attributable to $737 million in inventory valuation adjustments recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022 to reduce homes in inventory to their net realizable value following the rapid downturn in the U.S. housing market, beginning primarily in the second half of 2022. This included $458 million of inventory valuation adjustments on homes remaining in inventory at December 31, 2022.
For the same periods, Adjusted Gross Margin, which aligns the timing of inventory valuation adjustments to the period in which the home is sold, decreased from 7.0% to 0.8%. The decrease in Adjusted Gross Margin reflects the downturn in the U.S. housing market in the second half of 2022, resulting in market conditions at the time of resale to be weaker than we believed they would be at the time of pricing our inventory acquisitions. In addition, we prioritized risk management and resale clearance at the expense of resale margin performance in order to clear the old book inventory, which composed a majority of the resale cohort for the year ended December 31, 2023.Contribution Margin decreased from 3.4% to (3.7)% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, respectively, due to the reasons noted above as well as increased holding costs due to longer average inventory holding periods. Adjusted Gross Margin and Contribution Margin are non-GAAP financial measures. See “— 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
” for further details and a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to their nearest comparable GAAP measures.
Operating Expenses
Sales, Marketing and Operations
. Sales, marketing and operations decreased by $520 million, or 52%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $217 million decrease in resale transaction costs and broker commissions, consistent with the 55% decrease in revenue during the same period. Property holding costs decreased by $116 million, consistent with decreased inventory levels. Advertising expense decreased by $125 million, from $200 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $75 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 as we decreased marketing in both existing and new markets. In addition, headcount expenses, including salaries and benefits, decreased $58 million, which was largely attributable to workforce reductions and a reduction in contingent labor in 2023.
General and Administrative
. General and administrative decreased by $140 million, or 40%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to $46 million reduction in stock-based compensation, which was primarily related to the forfeiture of certain executive RSUs, including performance-based awards. In addition, the Company recorded a $46 million legal contingency accrual and related expenses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022 in connection with the FTC consent order finalized in October 2022. Headcount expenses, including salaries and benefits decreased $19 million, which was primarily attributable to workforce reductions in 2023.
Technology and Development
. Technology and development decreased by a nominal amount for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. 
Goodwill Impairment
. Goodwill impairment decreased by $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the market price of our common stock declined significantly causing the Company to perform an interim quantitative test for goodwill impairment. Based on the quantitative analysis, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. There was no impairment of goodwill identified for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Restructuring. 
Restructuring decreased by a nominal amount for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. 
Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt
Gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt increased by $241 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The gain on extinguishment of debt of $216 million in December 31, 2023 resulted from the Company’s partial repurchase of its 2026 Notes in 2023 at a discount net of unamortized deferred costs associated with the 2026 Notes, partially offset by expenses related to partial debt extinguishments during the year ended December 31, 2023.

Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased by $174 million, or 45%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to a significant decrease in the average outstanding balances of our non-recourse asset-backed debt.
Other Income (Loss) — Net
Other income (loss) – net increased by $117 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily related to an $84 million increase in interest income due to an increase in interest rates and a $4 million unrealized gain versus a $35 million unrealized loss on marketable equity securities during the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
Income Tax Expense
Income tax expense decreased by a nominal amount for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
Our principal sources of liquidity have historically consisted of cash generated from our operations and from financing activities. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $671 million, restricted cash of $92 million, and marketable securities of $8 million. The decrease in our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $389 million as compared to December 31, 2023 resulted primarily from operating losses and an increase in real estate inventory. The decrease in our restricted cash balance of $449 million as compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily a result of the increase in real estate inventory and $217 million net principal payments on non-recourse asset-backed debt.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had total outstanding balances on our asset-backed debt of $1.9 billion and aggregate principal outstanding from convertible senior notes of $381 million. In addition, we had undrawn borrowing capacity of $5 billion under our non-recourse asset-backed debt facilities (as described further below), of which $218 million was committed.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated transactions to repurchase a portion of the outstanding 2026 Notes (“Repurchased 2026 Notes”). We repurchased approximately $597 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2026 Notes as further described in “
Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 5. Credit Facilities and Long-Term Debt – Convertible Senior Notes
” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As market conditions warrant, we may, from time to time, repurchase additional outstanding debt securities in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer, by exchange transaction or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and other factors and may be commenced or suspended at any time. The amounts involved and total consideration paid may be material.
In May 2024, the Company entered into an at-the-market equity offering sales agreement (the “ATM Agreement”) with Barclays Capital Inc. and Virtu Americas LLC, as sales agents (the "Agents"), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, through the Agents, shares of the Company’s common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $200 million. Under the ATM Agreement, the Agents may sell shares by any method deemed to be an “at-the-market offering.” During the year ended December 31, 2024, there was no activity pursuant to the ATM Agreement.
We have incurred losses from inception through December 31, 2024 and expect to incur additional losses in the future. Our ability to service our debt and fund working capital, business operations and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities, which is subject to our future operating success, and ability to obtain inventory acquisition financing on reasonable terms, which is subject to factors beyond our control, including potential economic recession, rising interest rates, inflation and general economic, political and financial market conditions.

(Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share data and ratios, or as noted)
Our working capital requirements may increase should our inventory balance increase. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, together with cash we expect to generate from future operations and borrowings, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least 12 months from the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Debt and Financing Arrangements
Our financing activities include: short-term borrowings under our asset-backed senior revolving credit facilities; the issuance of long-term asset-backed senior term debt, asset-backed mezzanine term debt, and convertible debt; and new issuances of equity. Historically, we have required access to external financing resources in order to fund growth, expansion into new markets and strategic initiatives and we expect this to continue in the future. Our access to capital markets can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic conditions.
We primarily use non-recourse asset-backed debt, consisting of asset-backed senior debt facilities and asset-backed mezzanine term debt facilities, to provide financing for our real estate inventory purchases and renovations. Our business is capital intensive and maintaining adequate liquidity and capital resources is needed as we continue to scale and accumulate additional inventory. We intend to actively manage our relationships with multiple financial institutions and seek to optimize duration, flexibility, efficiency and cost of funds, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient capital for our business or to do so on acceptable financial and other terms.
Our asset-backed facilities are each collateralized by a specified pool of assets, consisting of real estate inventory, restricted cash and equity interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries of Opendoor that directly or indirectly own our real estate inventory. The terms of our inventory financing facilities require an Opendoor subsidiary to comply with customary financial covenants, such as maintaining certain levels of liquidity, tangible net worth or leverage (ratio of debt to tangible net worth). As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.
Our property financing subsidiaries’ assets and credit generally are not available to satisfy the debts and other obligations of any other Opendoor entities. Our asset-backed debt is non-recourse to Opendoor and our subsidiaries that are not party to the relevant financing arrangements, except for limited guarantees provided by an Opendoor subsidiary for certain obligations in situations involving “bad acts” by an Opendoor entity and certain other limited circumstances.
Our asset-backed senior debt facilities generally provide for advance rates of 75% to 90% against our cost basis in the underlying properties upon acquisition. Our mezzanine term facilities may finance up to 95% to 100% of our cost basis in the underlying properties upon acquisition. The maximum initial advance rates vary by facility and generally decrease on a fixed timeline that varies by facility based on the length of time a given property has been financed and other facility-specific adjustments, including adjustments based on collateral performance.
At times, we may be required to keep amounts in restricted cash accounts to collateralize our asset-backed term debt facilities if the property borrowing base is insufficient to satisfy the borrowing base requirements. These amounts may fluctuate due to seasonality, timing of property acquisitions and resales, and the outstanding loan balances under our asset-backed term debt facilities.

Asset-backed Senior Revolving Credit Facilities
We classify the senior revolving credit facilities as current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. In some cases, the borrowing capacity amounts under the asset-backed senior revolving credit facilities as reflected in the table are not fully committed and any borrowings above the committed amounts are subject to the applicable lender’s discretion. As of December 31, 2024, we had committed borrowing capacity with respect to asset-backed senior revolving credit facilities of $400 million.
The revolving period end dates and final maturity dates reflected in the table above are inclusive of any extensions that are at the sole discretion of the Company. Certain of our asset-backed senior revolving credit facilities also have additional extension options that are subject to lender approval that are not reflected in the table above.
Asset-backed Senior Term Debt Facilities
We classify our senior term debt facilities as current or non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets based on the applicable final maturity date. The carrying value of the non-current liabilities is reduced by issuance costs of $7 million. In some cases, the borrowing capacity amounts under the asset-backed senior term debt facilities as reflected in the table are not fully committed and any borrowings above the committed amounts are subject to the applicable lender’s discretion. As of December 31, 2024, we had committed borrowing capacity with respect to asset-backed senior term debt facilities of $1.4 billion.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, revenue, and expenses at the date of the financial statements. Generally, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions in accordance with GAAP that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We consider an accounting judgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policy and estimate addressed below. In addition, we have other key accounting policies and estimates that are described in “
Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 1. Description of Business and Accounting Policies”
.
Real Estate Inventory
Real estate inventory carrying value is equal to the lower of cost or net realizable value and each home constitutes the unit of account. Real estate inventory cost includes but is not limited to the property purchase price, acquisition costs and direct costs to renovate or repair the home, less inventory valuation adjustments, if any. The property purchase price is net of our service fee and represents the cash proceeds paid to the home seller. Real estate inventory is reviewed for valuation adjustments

on a quarterly basis. If the carrying amount for a given home is not expected to be recovered, an inventory valuation adjustment is recorded to cost of revenue and the home’s carrying value is adjusted to its net realizable value. Inventory valuation adjustments are not offset by any expected gains and are not reversed or adjusted should the expected net realizable value subsequently increase. For homes under resale contract, the net realizable value is the contract price less expected selling costs and any expected concessions. For all other homes, the net realizable value is our internal projection price less expected selling costs. Changes in our pricing assumptions may lead to a change in the outcome of our inventory valuation adjustment, and actual results may also differ from our assumptions.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.
We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily consist of fluctuations in interest rates and exposure to inflationary pressures.
Interest Rate Risk
We are subject to market risk by way of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our inventory financing facilities. As of December 31, 2024, we had total outstanding balances on our asset-backed debt of $1.9 billion, 91% of which was based on a fixed rate with an average duration of 1.8 years and the remaining 9% of which was based on a floating rate. Total property financing interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $116 million, of which $105 million was fixed and $11 million was floating. Accordingly, fluctuations in market interest rates may increase or decrease our interest expense. We may use interest rate cap derivatives, interest rate swaps, or other interest rate hedging instruments to economically hedge and manage interest rate risk with respect to our variable floating rate debt. Many of our floating rate debt facilities also have benchmark rate floors. Assuming no change in the outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities, we estimate that a one percentage point increase in applicable benchmark rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $2 million as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, 100% of our outstanding borrowings were at a fixed rate and did not utilize floating benchmark reference rates. 
Inflation Risk
We believe the inflation experienced in recent years has impacted the cost of goods and services that we consume, such as labor and materials costs for home repairs. Moreover, the current U.S. presidential administration has implemented tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, and has promoted plans for potential tariffs on goods from other countries and to pursue other trade policies intended to restrict imports, which may further increase the cost of materials for home repairs. We endeavor to offset these impacts in our business by appropriately considering them in our pricing and operational models. However, if our costs were to become subject to significant incremental inflationary pressure, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs by adjusting our operational model or our pricing methodology. Our inability to do so could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
In response to ongoing inflationary pressures in the U.S., the Federal Reserve implemented a number of increases to the federal funds rate since 2022, which, despite the Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point cut in September 2024 and 25 basis point cuts in November and December 2024, remains elevated compared to historical levels. See “Part I – Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Current Housing Environment” for a discussion of the impact of the increased federal funds rate on mortgage interest rates and our business.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Opendoor Technologies Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Opendoor Technologies Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and Schedule I listed in the Index at Item 8 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Real Estate Inventory, Net – Refer to Notes 1 and 2 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Real estate inventory, net includes a valuation adjustment to record real estate inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The Company applies the specific identification method whereby each home constitutes a unit of account. If the carrying amount or basis of inventory is not expected to be recovered, an inventory valuation adjustment is recorded to cost of revenue and the related assets are adjusted to their net realizable value. For homes under sales contract, the net realizable value is the contract price less expected selling costs and concessions. For homes that are not under sales contract, net realizable value is management’s internal projection price less expected selling costs. The determination of net realizable value for homes not under sales contract requires management to make significant estimates related to the internal projection price. Changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on the net realizable value and a significant change in net realizable value could cause a significant valuation adjustment.
68
TABLE OF CONTENTS

We identified real estate inventory valuation adjustment for homes that are not under sales contract, which is the majority of the real estate inventory valuation adjustment, to be a critical audit matter due to the subjectivity of management’s judgment in forecasting the net realizable value of the real estate inventory, specifically with respect to the internal projection price. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s internal projection price.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the internal projection price input used for real estate inventory valuation adjustments for homes that are not under sales contract included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the internal projection price valuation process, calculation of the valuation adjustment, and management’s consideration of macroeconomic factors with respect to the valuation adjustment.
•
We evaluated whether the estimates of the real estate inventory valuation adjustments for homes that are not under sales contract were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit, including internal communications to management and the Board of Directors.
•
We made inquiries of management throughout the period about the expected effects of macroeconomic factors on the internal projection price. 
•
We developed an expectation of the real estate inventory valuation adjustment for homes that are not under sales contract and compared it to the recorded balance.
•
We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast the internal projection price by comparing actual sales prices to management’s historical internal projection prices.
•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists we: 
◦
Evaluated the appropriateness of the methodology utilized by management to estimate the internal projection price.
◦
Developed a range of independent projected sales price estimates for a sample of individual homes using observable market data of actual sale transactions for comparable homes and compared those to management’s internal projection price.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Description of Business
Opendoor Technologies Inc. (the “Company” and “Opendoor”) including its consolidated subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities (“VIEs”), is a managed marketplace for residential real estate. By leveraging its centralized digital platform, Opendoor is working towards a future that enables sellers and buyers of residential real estate to experience a simple and certain transaction that is dramatically improved from the traditional process. The Company was incorporated in Delaware on December 30, 2013.
The Company completed a business combination with Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. II (“SCH”), a Cayman Islands exempted company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”). The Business Combination, pursuant to which Opendoor Labs Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of SCH and SCH changed its name from “Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. II” to “Opendoor Technologies Inc.”, was completed on December 18, 2020 (the “Closing”), and was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, in accordance with GAAP.
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 include the accounts of Opendoor, its wholly owned subsidiaries and VIEs where the Company is the primary beneficiary. The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements herein. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.
At-The-Market Equity Offering
In May 2024, the Company entered into an at-the-market equity offering sales agreement (the “ATM Agreement”) with Barclays Capital Inc. and Virtu Americas LLC, as sales agents (the "Agents"), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, through the Agents, shares of the Company’s common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $
200
 million. Under the ATM Agreement, the Agents may sell shares by any method deemed to be an “at-the-market offering.” During the year ended December 31, 2024, there was no activity pursuant to the ATM Agreement. 
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates, assumptions and judgments made by management include, among others, the determination of the fair value of common stock, share-based awards, and inventory valuation adjustment. Management believes that the estimates and judgments upon which management relies are reasonable based upon information available to management at the time that these estimates and judgments are made. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates, assumptions and judgments and actual results, the carrying values of the Company’s assets and liabilities and the results of operations will be affected. The health of the residential housing market and interest rate environment have introduced additional uncertainty with respect to judgments, estimates, and assumptions, which may materially impact the estimates previously listed, among others.
Significant Risks and Uncertainties
The Company operates in a dynamic industry and, accordingly, can be affected by a variety of factors. For example, the Company believes that changes in any of the following areas could have a significant negative effect on the Company in terms of its future financial position, results of operations or cash flows: its rates of revenue growth; its ability to manage inventory; engagement and usage of its products; the effectiveness of its investment of resources to pursue strategies; competition in its

(Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts, ratios, or as noted)
market; the stability of the residential real estate market; the impact of interest rate changes on demand for and pricing of its products and on the cost of capital; political and regulatory trends, including potential increased tariffs; changes in technology, products, markets or services by the Company or its competitors; its ability to maintain or establish relationships with listings and data providers; its ability to obtain or maintain licenses and permits to support its current and future businesses; actual or anticipated changes to its products and services; changes in government regulation affecting its business; the outcomes of legal proceedings; natural disasters and catastrophic events, such as pandemics or epidemics; scaling and adaptation of existing technology and network infrastructure; its management of its growth; its ability to attract and retain qualified employees and key personnel; its ability to successfully integrate and realize the benefits of its past or future strategic acquisitions or investments; the protection of customers’ information and other privacy concerns; the protection of its brand and intellectual property; and intellectual property infringement and other claims, among other things.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments in marketable and non-marketable securities. The Company places cash and cash equivalents and investments with major financial institutions, which management assesses to be of high credit quality, in order to limit exposure of the Company’s investments.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Segment Reporting
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company was managed as a single operating and reportable segment on a consolidated basis. Furthermore, the Company determined that the Chief Executive Officer is the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) as the CEO is responsible for making decisions regarding the allocation of resources and assessing performance, as well as for strategic operational decisions and managing the organization at a consolidated level.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash includes demand deposits with financial institutions and cash items in transit. Cash equivalents include only investments with initial maturities of three months or less that are highly liquid and readily convertible to known amounts of cash. The Company maintains portions of the Company’s cash in bank deposit accounts, which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Management believes that the Company is not exposed to any significant credit risk related to cash deposits.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash consists primarily of funds held in operating, collection, disbursement and reserve accounts related to the Company’s credit facilities and entities established for such credit facilities. The use of the restricted cash balance related to the Company’s credit facilities are constrained by contract to purchasing real estate inventory and certain related activities. In addition, the Company is required to maintain letters of credit and a time deposit account for certain of the Company’s office leases.
 See 
“Note 5 — Credit Facilities and Long-Term Debt”
 for further discussion.
Investments
Marketable Securities
Marketable equity securities are publicly traded and have readily determinable fair values with changes in fair value recorded in Other income (loss)-net. The Company’s investments in marketable securities consist of debt securities classified as available-for-sale as well as marketable equity securities. The Company’s available-for-sale debt securities are measured at fair 
77
TABLE OF CONTENTS
OPENDOOR TECHNOLOGIES INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts, ratios, or as noted)
value with unrealized gains and losses included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity and realized gains and losses included in Other income (loss)-net. 
Non-Marketable Equity Securities and Equity Method Investments
Non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments are investments in privately held companies that do not have readily determinable fair values. These securities are accounted for under one of the following accounting methods:
•
Equity method: This method is applied when the Company has the ability to exert significant influence over the investee. The securities are recorded at cost and adjusted for the Company’s share of the investee’s earnings or losses, less any dividends received and/or impairments.
•
Measurement alternative: This method is followed for all remaining non-marketable equity securities. These securities are recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, adjusted for changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same issuer.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses or the Company's share of the investee's earnings or losses on non-marketable equity securities, including impairment losses, are recognized in Other income (loss)-net. Any dividends on equity method investments are recognized as a reduction of the investment's carrying value. Non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments are reported in Other assets.
The Company assesses whether an impairment loss on its non-marketable equity securities has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market conditions. When the fair value of an equity method investment is less than its carrying value, the Company writes down the investment to fair value when the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary. When the fair value of an investment accounted for using the measurement alternative is less than its carrying value, the Company writes down the investment to its fair value, without the consideration of recovery.
 See 
“Note 3 — Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments”
 for further discussion.
Real Estate Inventory
Real estate inventory is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value and the Company applies the specific identification method whereby each property constitutes the unit of account. Real estate inventory cost includes but is not limited to the property purchase price, acquisition costs and direct costs to renovate or repair the home, less inventory valuation adjustments, if any. Work-in-progress inventory includes homes undergoing repairs and finished goods inventory includes homes that are listed for sale, including homes ready for listing, and homes under contract for sale. Real estate inventory is reviewed for valuation adjustments at least quarterly. If the carrying amount or cost basis is not expected to be recovered, an inventory valuation adjustment is recorded to Cost of revenue and the related assets are adjusted to their net realizable value.
Convertible Senior Notes
The 
0.25
% convertible senior notes due in 2026 (the "2026 Notes") issued by the Company in August 2021 are accounted for wholly as debt. The 2026 Notes have an initial carrying value equal to the net proceeds from issuance. Issuance costs associated with the 2026 Notes are amortized over the term using the effective interest method. Conversions are settled through payment of cash or a combination of cash and stock, at the Company's option. Upon conversion, the carrying amount of the 2026 Notes, including any unamortized debt issuance costs, is reduced by cash paid, with any difference being reflected as a change in equity. There will not be any gains or losses recognized upon a conversion. Upon extinguishment of any portion of the 2026 Notes, the difference between the repurchase price of the extinguished notes and the respective net carrying amount is recorded as a gain or loss in (Loss) gain on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of operations. See “Note 5 — Credit Facilities and Long-Term Debt” for details on the partial repurchase of the Company's convertible notes.
Capped Calls
The Company purchased certain capped calls in connection with the issuance of the 2026 Notes which it expects to reduce potential dilution from conversions of the 2026 Notes. The capped calls were determined to be freestanding financial 
78
TABLE OF CONTENTS
OPENDOOR TECHNOLOGIES INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts, ratios, or as noted)
instruments that meet the criteria for classification in equity; as such, the capped calls were recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital within shareholders' equity and will not be subsequently remeasured.
Escrow Receivable
Escrow receivable consists of proceeds from home resale held in escrow prior to such proceeds being remitted to the Company. The Company reviews the need for an allowance for credit losses quarterly based on historical collections experience, among other factors.
 As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did 
not
 record an allowance for credit losses and for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company did 
not
 have any material write-offs.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Property and equipment are capitalized and depreciated. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of assets. Maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred.

The estimated useful lives of the Company’s property and equipment are as follows:
Internally developed software
2
 years
Software implementation costs
Lesser of 
3
 years or contract term
Computers
2
 years
Security systems
1
 year
Furniture and fixtures
5
 years
Leasehold improvements
Lesser of useful life or lease term
Office equipment
3
 years
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception or modification of the arrangement. An arrangement is or contains a lease if there are identified assets and the right to control the use of an identified asset is conveyed for a period in exchange for consideration. Control over the use of the identified assets means the lessee has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right to direct the use of the asset.
For leases for which the Company is the lessee, the Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases other than those with a term of 12 months or less as the Company has elected to apply the short-term lease recognition exemption. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. Lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are classified and recognized at the commencement date of a lease. Lease liabilities are measured based on the present value of fixed lease payments over the lease term. Right-of-use assets consist of (i) initial measurement of the lease liability; (ii) lease payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received; and (iii) initial direct costs incurred by the Company. Lease payments may vary because of changes in facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement, including changes in inflation indices. Variable lease payments are excluded from the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.
As the rates implicit on the Company’s leases for which it is the lessee are not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. When determining the incremental borrowing rate, the Company assesses multiple variables such as lease term, collateral, economic conditions, and its creditworthiness.
For operating leases, the Company recognizes straight-line rent expense. 
The Company’s lease arrangements may include options to extend or early terminate a lease, which it does not include in expected lease terms unless they are reasonably certain to be exercised. The Company has lease arrangements with lease and 
79

OPENDOOR TECHNOLOGIES INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts, ratios, or as noted)
non-lease components. As a lessee, the Company has elected to apply the practical expedient to combine lease and related non-lease components, for all classes of underlying assets, and shall account for the combined component as a lease component.
Internally Developed Software
For software the Company develops for internal use, the costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application reaches the development stage, the Company capitalizes direct costs incurred (including internal and external) to property and equipment. Maintenance and on-going operating costs of developed applications are expensed as incurred. Amortization expense is recognized on a straight-line basis into technology and development expense.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized. The Company has a single reporting unit and management reviews goodwill for impairment annually on the first day of the third quarter and also if events or changes in circumstances indicate the occurrence of a triggering event. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment by initially considering qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative analysis is performed to identify goodwill impairment.
Intangible Assets
The Company recorded intangible assets with finite lives, including developed technology, customer relationships, trademarks, and non-competition agreements, as a result of acquisitions as well as internal development. Intangible assets were amortized based on their estimated economic lives, ranging from 
1
 to 
5
 years.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets, among other long-lived assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the underlying asset exceeds its fair value.
 The impairment loss recognized for the periods presented is primarily related to abandonment of certain internally developed software projects. 
The impairment loss recognized during the periods presented is as follows (in millions):

Revenue Recognition
The Company generates revenue through home sales, along with other revenue from ancillary real estate services in the United States. Other revenue represents an insignificant portion of the Company’s total revenue.
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies its performance obligations by transferring control of promised goods or services to its customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.

(Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts, ratios, or as noted)
Home sales revenue consists of selling residential real estate to customers. Revenue is recognized when title to and possession of the property has transferred to the customer and the Company has no continuing involvement with the property, which is generally upon close of escrow. The amount of revenue recognized for each home sale is equal to the sale price of the home net of any concessions. 
Other revenue consists primarily of title insurance facilitation revenue, closing and escrow services, and real estate broker commissions. These real estate services are provided in conjunction with home sales, and revenue is recognized consistent with home sales revenue, generally upon close of escrow.
No customers generated 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.
Cost of Revenue
Cost of revenue includes the property purchase price, acquisition costs, direct costs to renovate or repair the home and inventory valuation adjustments, if any. These costs are accumulated in real estate inventory during the property holding period and charged to cost of revenue under the specific identification method when the property is sold. Additionally, for the Company’s revenues other than home sales revenue, cost of revenue consists of any costs incurred in delivering the service including associated headcount expenses such as salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation.
Sales, Marketing and Operations Expense
Sales, marketing and operations expense consists primarily of resale broker commissions, resale closing costs, holding costs related to real estate inventory including utilities, property taxes and maintenance, and expenses associated with product marketing, promotions and brand-building. Sales, marketing and operations expense includes any headcount expenses in support of sales, marketing, and real estate inventory operations such as salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation. These costs are expensed as incurred.
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
 For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, expenses attributable to advertising totaled $
86
 million, $
75
 million, and $
200
 million, respectively.
Technology and Development
Technology and development expense consists primarily of headcount expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for employees in the design, development, testing, maintenance and operation of the Company’s websites, tools, applications, and mobile apps that support its products. Technology and development expense also includes amortization of capitalized software development costs and third-party software and hosting costs.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation awards consist of stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and shares of restricted stock (“Restricted Shares”), and shares issued pursuant the 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”).
Stock Options
The Company has granted stock options with a service condition to vest, which is generally 
four years
. The Company records stock-based compensation expense for service-based stock options on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. These amounts are reduced by forfeitures as they occur. The Company uses the 
Black-Scholes-Merton
 option-pricing model to determine the fair value as of the grant date for stock options.
RSUs
Prior to its listing, the Company granted RSUs with a performance condition, based on a liquidity event, as defined by the share agreement, as well as a service condition to vest, which was generally 
four years
. The Company determined the fair value of RSUs based on the valuation of the Company’s common stock as of the grant date. No compensation expense was 
81
TABLE OF CONTENTS
OPENDOOR TECHNOLOGIES INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts, ratios, or as noted)
recognized for performance-based awards until the liquidity event occurred in February 2021. Subsequent to the occurrence of the liquidity event, compensation expense was recognized on an accelerated attribution basis over the requisite service period of the awards. 
After the Company became listed, the Company began granting RSUs subject to a service condition to vest, which is generally 
two
 to 
four years
. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis subject to a floor of the vested number of shares for each award. In the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company began granting RSUs to certain executive employees that contain a performance condition and service condition to vest. If the award is deemed probable of being earned, compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated attribution basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally 
three years
. The Company reassesses the probability of achieving the performance condition at each reporting date during the performance period. The Company determines the fair value of RSUs based on the Company’s grant date closing stock price and recognizes forfeitures as they occur.
Market Condition RSUs
The Company has granted RSUs with a performance condition, based on a liquidity event, as defined by the share agreement, as well as a market condition to vest. Subject to the employee’s continued services to the Company, the market-based conditions are satisfied upon the Company's achievement of certain share price milestones calculated based on 60-day volume weighted average.
For market-based RSUs, the Company determines the grant-date fair value utilizing Monte Carlo simulations, which incorporates various assumptions, including expected stock price volatility, contractual term, dividend yield, and stock price at grant date. The Company estimates the volatility of common stock on the date of grant based on the weighted-average historical stock price volatility of comparable publicly-traded companies. As the Company had no history of dividend payments and had not declared any prospective dividends, a 
0
% dividend yield was assumed. 
For stock-based compensation, each market-based condition is treated as an accounting unit and expense is recognized over the requisite service period with respect to each unit and only if performance-based conditions are considered probable to be satisfied. The Company determines the requisite service period by comparing the derived service period to achieve the market-based condition and the explicit service-based period, if any, using the longer of the two service periods as the requisite service period.
Restricted Shares
The fair value of the Restricted Shares is equal to the estimated fair value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the shares on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards. The fair value of these shares will be recognized into common stock and additional paid-in-capital as the shares vest.
ESPP
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to purchase rights granted pursuant to the 2020 ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period. The Company estimates the fair value of purchase rights granted under the ESPP using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
Income Taxes
The Company records income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using the enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future 
82
TABLE OF CONTENTS
OPENDOOR TECHNOLOGIES INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts, ratios, or as noted)
reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If the Company determines that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, the Company would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
The Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby: (1) it determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, it recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
The Company is a variable interest holder in certain entities in which equity investors at risk do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or where the entity does not have enough equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties; these entities are VIEs. The Company’s variable interest arises from contractual, ownership or other monetary interest in the entity, which fluctuates based on the VIE’s economic performance. The Company consolidates a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary. The Company is the primary beneficiary if it has a controlling financial interest, which includes both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and a variable interest that obligates the Company to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. To determine whether a variable interest the Company holds could potentially be significant to the VIE, the Company considers both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the nature, size and form of its involvement with the VIE. The Company assesses whether or not the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In July 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-03 which amends various paragraphs in the Accounting Standards Codification pursuant to the issuance of Commission Staff Bulletin No. 120. These updates were effective immediately and did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, which expands reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financials is required. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 in its annual reporting period as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. See “
Note 18
—
 Segment Information” 
for further discussion.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-04 which clarifies the requirements for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments should be accounted for as an induced conversion. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted for all entities that have adopted the amendments in Update 2020-06. The Company early adopted ASU 2024-04 as of the year ended December 31, 2024. The updates had no impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 
Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06 which is intended to clarify or improve disclosure and presentation requirements of a variety of topics. It will allow users to more easily compare entities subject to the SEC's existing disclosures with those entities that were not previously subject to the requirements and align the requirements in the FASB accounting standard codification with the SEC's regulations. The effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC's removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, or if the SEC has not removed the applicable disclosure requirement by June 30, 2027, the amendment will not be effective for any entity. Early adoption is prohibited. The Company is currently assessing the impact on the Company's disclosures.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES
The Company utilizes VIEs in the normal course of business to support the Company’s financing needs. The Company determines whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE at the time it becomes involved with the VIE and reconsiders that conclusion on an on-going basis. See 
“Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies”
 for further discussion of the Company’s “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities” policy.
The Company established certain special purpose entities (“SPEs”) for the purpose of financing the Company’s purchase and renovation of real estate inventory through the issuance of asset-backed debt. The Company is the primary beneficiary of the various VIEs within these financing structures and consolidates these VIEs. The Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary based on its power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic outcomes of the SPEs through its role in designing the SPEs and managing the real estate inventory they purchase and sell. The Company has a potentially significant variable interest in the entities based upon the equity interest the Company holds in the VIEs.

The creditors of the VIEs generally do not have recourse to the Company’s general credit solely by virtue of being creditors of the VIEs. However, certain of the financial covenants included in the inventory financing facilities to which the VIEs are party are calculated by reference to Opendoor Labs Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities. As a result, under certain circumstances, this may limit the Company’s flexibility to transfer assets from Opendoor subsidiaries to the Parent Company. See 
“Note 5 — Credit Facilities and Long-Term Debt”
 for further discussion of the recourse obligations with respect to the VIEs.

Non-Recourse Asset-backed Debt
The Company utilizes inventory financing facilities consisting of asset-backed senior debt facilities and asset-backed mezzanine term debt facilities to provide financing for the Company’s real estate inventory purchases and renovation. These inventory financing facilities are typically secured by some combination of restricted cash, equity in real estate owning subsidiaries and related holding companies, and, for senior facilities, the real estate inventory financed by the relevant facility and/or beneficial interests in such inventory. 
Each of the borrowers under the inventory financing facilities is a consolidated subsidiary of Opendoor and a separate legal entity. Neither the assets nor credit of any such borrower subsidiaries are generally available to satisfy the debts and other obligations of any other Opendoor entities. The inventory financing facilities are non-recourse to the Company and are non-recourse to Opendoor subsidiaries not party to the relevant facilities, except for limited guarantees provided by an Opendoor subsidiary for certain obligations involving “bad acts” by an Opendoor entity and certain other limited circumstances. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had total borrowing capacity with respect to its non-recourse asset-backed debt of $
6.9
 billion. Borrowing capacity amounts under non-recourse asset-backed debt as reflected in the table above are in some cases not fully committed and any borrowings above the committed amounts are subject to the applicable lender’s discretion. Any amounts repaid for senior term and mezzanine term debt facilities reduce total borrowing capacity as repaid amounts are not available to be reborrowed. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had committed borrowing capacity with respect to the Company’s non-recourse asset backed debt of $
2.2
 billion; this committed borrowing capacity is comprised of $
400
 million for senior revolving credit facilities, $
1.4
 billion for senior term debt facilities, and $
350
 million for mezzanine term debt facilities.
The Company recognized $
2

Asset-backed Senior Revolving Credit Facilities
The Company classifies the senior revolving credit facilities as current liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as amounts drawn to acquire and renovate homes are required to be repaid as the related real estate inventory is sold, which the Company expects to occur within 
12
 months. 
The senior revolving credit facilities are typically structured with an initial revolving period of up to 
24
 months during which time amounts can be borrowed, repaid and borrowed again. The borrowing capacity is generally available until the end of the applicable revolving period as reflected in the table above. Outstanding amounts drawn under each senior revolving credit facility are required to be repaid on the facility maturity date or earlier if accelerated due to an event of default or other mandatory repayment event. The final maturity dates and revolving period end dates reflected in the table above are inclusive of any extensions that are at the sole discretion of the Company. These facilities may also have extensions subject to lender discretion that are not reflected in the table above.
Borrowings under the senior revolving credit facilities accrue interest at various floating rates based on a secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”), plus a margin that varies by facility. The Company may also pay fees on certain unused portions of committed borrowing capacity. The Company’s senior revolving credit facility arrangements typically include upfront fees that may be paid at execution of the applicable agreements or be earned at execution and payable over time. These facilities are generally fully prepayable at any time without penalty other than customary breakage costs.
The senior revolving credit facilities have aggregated borrowing bases, which increase or decrease based on the cost and value of the properties financed under a given facility and the time that those properties are in the Company’s possession. When the Company resells a home, the proceeds are used to reduce the outstanding balance under the related senior revolving credit facility. The borrowing base for a given facility may be reduced as properties age beyond certain thresholds or the performance of the properties financed under that facility declines, and any borrowing base deficiencies may be satisfied through contributions of additional properties or partial repayment of the facility.
Asset-backed Senior Term Debt Facilities
The Company classifies its senior term debt facilities as current or non-current liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets based on the applicable final maturity date.
The senior term debt facilities are typically structured with an initial withdrawal period up to 
60
 months during which the outstanding principal amounts are generally not required to be repaid when homes financed through those facilities are sold and instead are intended to remain outstanding until final maturity for each facility. Outstanding amounts drawn under each senior term debt facility are required to be repaid on the facility maturity date or earlier if accelerated due to an event of default or other mandatory repayment event. The final maturity dates and withdrawal period end dates reflected in the table above are inclusive of any extensions that are at the sole discretion of the Company. These facilities may also have extensions subject to lender discretion that are not reflected in the table above.
Borrowings under the senior term debt facilities accrue interest at a fixed rate. The Company's senior term debt facilities may include upfront issuance costs that are capitalized as part of the facilities' respective carrying values. These facilities are fully prepayable at any time but may be subject to certain customary prepayment penalties.
The senior term debt facilities have aggregated property borrowing bases, which increase or decrease based on the cost and value of the properties financed under a given facility, the time those properties are in the Company’s possession and the amount of cash collateral pledged by the relevant borrowers. The borrowing base for a given facility may be reduced as properties age or collateral performance declines beyond certain thresholds, and any borrowing base deficiencies may be satisfied through contributions of additional properties, cash or through partial repayment of the facility.

Asset-backed Mezzanine Term Debt Facilities
The Company classifies its mezzanine term debt facilities as current or non-current liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets based on the applicable final maturity date. These facilities are structurally and contractually subordinated to the related asset-backed senior debt facilities.
The mezzanine term debt facilities have been structured with an initial 
42
 month withdrawal period during which the outstanding principal amounts are generally not required to be repaid when homes financed through those facilities are sold and instead are intended to remain outstanding until final maturity. Outstanding amounts drawn under the mezzanine term debt facilities are required to be repaid on the facility maturity date or earlier if accelerated due to an event of default or other mandatory repayment event. The final maturity date and withdrawal period end date reflected in the table above are inclusive of any extensions that are at the sole discretion of the Company. These facilities may also have extensions subject to lender discretion that are not reflected in the table above.
Borrowings under a given mezzanine term debt facility accrue interest at a fixed rate. The Company’s mezzanine term debt facilities include upfront issuance costs that are capitalized as part of the facilities’ respective carrying values. These facilities are fully prepayable at any time but may be subject to certain prepayment penalties.
The mezzanine term debt facilities have aggregated property borrowing bases, which increase or decrease based on the cost and value of the properties financed under a given facility and time in the Company’s possession of those properties and the amount of cash collateral pledged by the relevant borrowers. The borrowing base for a given facility may be reduced as properties age or collateral performance declines beyond certain thresholds, and any borrowing base deficiencies may be satisfied through contributions of additional properties, cash or through partial repayment of the facility.
Covenants
The Company’s inventory financing facilities include customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default. Financed properties are subject to customary eligibility criteria and concentration limits.
The terms of these inventory financing facilities and related financing documents require an Opendoor subsidiary to comply with customary financial covenants, such as maintaining certain levels of liquidity, tangible net worth or leverage (ratio of debt to tangible net worth). Certain of these financial covenants are calculated by reference to Opendoor Labs Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities. As a result, under certain circumstances, this may limit the Company’s flexibility to transfer assets from Opendoor subsidiaries to the Parent Company. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $
250
 million and $
275
 million, respectively, of the Company's net assets were restricted as they reflect minimum net asset requirements at Opendoor Labs Inc. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants and no event of default had occurred.
Convertible Senior Notes
In August 2021, the Company issued the 2026 Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $

The 2026 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders before February 15, 2026 only upon the occurrence of certain events. Beginning on August 20, 2024, the Company has the option to redeem the 2026 Notes upon meeting certain conditions related to price of the Company's common stock. Beginning on February 15, 2026 and until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the 2026 Notes are convertible at any time at election of each holder. The conversion rate and conversion price are subject to customary adjustments under certain circumstances. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change occur, then the conversion rate will be adjusted in accordance with the make-whole table within the Indenture. Upon conversion, the Company may satisfy its obligation by paying cash for the outstanding principal balance, and, a combination of cash and the Company's common stock, at the Company's election, for the remaining amount, if any, based on the applicable conversion rate.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated transactions to repurchase a portion of the outstanding 2026 Notes (“Repurchased 2026 Notes”). The holders of the Repurchased 2026 Notes exchanged $
597
 million in aggregate principal amount for aggregate payments of $
360
 million in cash for full settlement of the principal value and accrued interest on such date. The Company accounted for the repurchase as a debt extinguishment. Accordingly, the Company: (i) reduced the carrying value of the Repurchased 2026 Notes by $
597
 million, (ii) reduced outstanding deferred issuance costs by $
10
 million, (iii) incurred fees of $
2
 million and (iv) recorded $
225
 million of gain on debt extinguishment. The Company elected to leave the Capped Calls associated with the Repurchased 2026 Notes outstanding.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, total interest expense on the Company's convertible senior notes was $
3
 million, with coupon interest of $
1
 million and amortization of debt issuance costs of $
2
 million. For the year ended December 31, 2023, total interest expense on the Company's convertible senior notes was $
5
 million, with coupon interest of $
2
 million and amortization of debt issuance costs of $
3
 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, total interest expense on the Company's convertible senior notes was $
7
 million, with coupon interest of $
2
 million and amortization of debt issuance costs of $
5
 million.
Capped Calls
In August 2021, in connection with the issuance of the 2026 Notes, the Company purchased capped calls (the “Capped Calls”) from certain financial institutions at a cost of $
119
 million. The Capped Calls cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of the Company's common stock underlying the 2026 Notes. By entering into the Capped Calls, the Company expects to reduce the potential dilution to its common stock (or, in the event of a conversion of the 2026 Notes settled in cash, to reduce its cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the 2026 Notes its common stock price exceeds the conversion price. The Capped Calls have an initial strike price of $
19.23
 per share and an initial cap price of $
29.59
 per share or a cap price premium of 
100
%.
In December 2024, the Company settled 
75
% of the outstanding Capped Calls and received cash of $
2
 million from certain counterparties, which was recognized as an increase in additional paid-in-capital in the fourth quarter of 2024.

FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES
The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures.
Following is a discussion of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis and for estimating fair value for financial instruments not recorded at fair value.
Fair Value Hierarchy
Fair value measurements of assets and liabilities are categorized based on the following hierarchy:
Level 1 —
 Fair value determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 —
 Fair value determined using significant observable inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are 
91
TABLE OF CONTENTS
OPENDOOR TECHNOLOGIES INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts, ratios, or as noted)
observable for the asset or liability, or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data, by correlation or other means.
Level 3 —
 Fair value determined using significant unobservable inputs, such as pricing models, discounted cash flows, or similar techniques.
Estimation of Fair Value
The following table summarizes the fair value measurement methodologies, including significant inputs and assumptions, and classification of the Company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 
Asset/Liability Class
Valuation Methodology, Inputs and
Assumptions
Classification
Marketable securities
Debt securities
Prices obtained from third-party vendors that compile prices from various sources and often apply matrix pricing for similar securities when no price is observable.
Level 2 recurring fair value measurement.
Equity securities
Price is quoted given the securities are traded on an exchange.
Level 1 recurring fair value measurement.

In December 2024, certain operating leases were terminated early by the Company, which resulted in a decrease of undiscounted, future lease payments of $
8
 million. These early terminations resulted in the reduction of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of approximately $
13
 million. The Company paid $
4
 million in early termination fees associated with these leases and recognized $
3
 million in total lease termination costs which are recognized in Restructuring on the consolidated statements of operations. See 
“Note 20 - Restructuring”
 for further discussion. There were no other material lease modifications for the year ended December 31, 2024.
In May 2023, the Company amended its Tempe, Arizona office lease to partially terminate the Company’s obligation with respect to a portion of the leased premises (“Partial Lease Termination”). The Partial Lease Termination resulted in a decrease of undiscounted, future lease payments of $
19
 million. As a result of the Partial Lease Termination, the Company remeasured its operating lease liabilities and recorded a decrease of $
10
 million to reflect the reduced lease payments and termination penalties. The Company also recorded a decrease to right-of-use assets of $
9
 million based on the proportionate decrease in the right-of-use asset, which resulted in a gain of $
1
 million recognized in general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.

SHARE-BASED AWARDS
2014 Stock Plan
Our 2014 Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”), as last amended and approved by the board of directors on February 6, 2020, allowed the Company to grant up to 
106,320,623
 shares of common stock to employees, directors, and non-employees pursuant to awards of stock options, restricted stock or restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted under the 2014 Plan. Upon the Closing, the remaining unallocated share reserve under the 2014 Plan was cancelled and no new awards will be granted under the 2014 Plan. Awards outstanding under the 2014 Plan were assumed by Opendoor Technologies upon the Closing and continue to be governed by the terms of the 2014 Plan. 
2020 Equity Incentive Plans
In connection with the close of the Business Combination, the Company adopted the 2020 Incentive Award Plan (the “2020 Plan”) under which 
43,508,048
 shares of common stock were initially reserved for issuance. The 2020 Plan allows for the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, dividend equivalents and other stock or cash based awards. The number of shares of the Company’s common stock available for issuance under the 2020 Plan automatically increases on the first day of each calendar year, beginning January 1, 2022 and ending on and including January 1, 2030, by the lesser of (a) a number equal to the excess (if any) of (1) 
5
% of the aggregate number of shares of common Stock outstanding on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year over (2) the number of shares of common Stock then reserved for issuance under the 2020 Plan as of such date, and (b) such smaller number of shares determined by the Company’s board of directors. Pursuant to this automatic increase provision, as of December 31, 2024, 
126,566,170
 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2020 Plan.
In connection with the close of the Business Combination, the Company’s board of directors approved the 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”), which was last amended on February 8, 2023. There are 
5,438,506
 shares of common stock initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The number of shares of the Company’s common stock available for issuance under the ESPP automatically increases on the first day of each calendar year, beginning January 1, 2022 and ending on and including January 1, 2030, by the lesser of (a) 
1
% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the immediately preceding calendar year and (b) such number of shares as is determined by the Company’s board of directors; provided that, no more than 
54,385,060
 shares may be issued under the ESPP. Pursuant to this automatic increase provision, as of December 31, 2024, 
24,749,340
 shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under the ESPP. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, shares issued under the ESPP were 
3,133,493
 at a weighted average price of $
1.59
 per share and 
2,151,794
 at a weighted average price of $
1.16

2022 Inducement Plan
In July 2022, the Company’s board of directors adopted the 2022 Inducement Plan (the “Inducement Plan”). Under the Inducement Plan, 
31,200,000
 shares were initially reserved for issuance. The purpose of the Inducement Plan is to attract, retain and motivate prospective employees of the Company, particularly executive team members and employees joining as part of business combinations.

 period. 
In the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the Company began granting RSUs to certain executive employees that contain both a performance and service condition to vest. If the award is deemed probable of being earned, compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated attribution basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally 
three years
. The Company reassesses the probability of achieving the performance condition at each reporting date during the performance period.

ESPP
The first offering period for the Company's 2020 ESPP began on March 1, 2022. The ESPP, pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 423, allows eligible participants to purchase shares using payroll deductions of up to 
15
% of their total compensation, subject to a $
25,000
 calendar year limitation on contributions. Prior to March 2023, the Company limited the maximum number of shares to be purchased in an offering period to 
1,000
 shares per employee, and each offering period was 
six months
 in duration. Beginning in March 2023, the maximum number of shares to be purchased in an offering period was increased to 
10,000
 shares per employee, 
5,000
 per purchase period, and each offering period is 
12
 months in duration, with 
two

6-month
 purchase periods. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a 
15
% discount on the lower price of either (i) the offer period start date or (ii) the purchase date. The ESPP also includes a reset provision for the purchase price if the stock price on the purchase date is less than the stock price on the offering date. ESPP employee payroll contributions withheld as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $
1
 million and $
2
 million, respectively, and are included within Accounts payable and other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Payroll contributions withheld as of December 31, 2024 will be used to purchase shares at the end of the current ESPP purchase period ending on February 28, 2025.
The fair value of ESPP purchase rights is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation model. The following assumptions were applied in the model to estimate the grant-date fair value of the ESPP.

Fair Value of Common Stock
Prior to the Company’s common stock becoming publicly traded, the fair value of the common stock underlying the stock option awards was determined by the board of directors. Given the absence of a public trading market, the board of directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of the Company’s common stock at each meeting at which awards were approved. These factors included, but were not limited to (i) contemporaneous third-party valuations of common stock; (ii) the rights, preferences and privileges of convertible preferred stock relative to common stock; (iii) the lack of marketability of common stock; (iv) stage and development of the Company’s business; (v) general economic conditions and (vi) the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale, given prevailing market conditions.
Volatility
Prior to the Company’s common stock becoming publicly traded, the expected stock price volatilities were estimated based on the historical and implied volatilities of comparable publicly traded companies as the Company did not have sufficient history of trading its common stock. Subsequent to the Company’s stock becoming publicly trade, the expected stock price volatilities were determined based on the volatilities implied by the price of the Company’s publicly traded call options in its common stock.
Risk-Free Interest Rate
The risk-free interest rates are based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect at the grant date for notes with comparable terms as the awards.
Expected Life
The expected term of options granted to employees is determined using the simplified method, which allows the Company to estimate the expected life as the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual term, as the Company's historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term.
Dividend Yield
The expected dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s current expectations about its anticipated dividend policy.
Valuation of RSUs and Restricted Stock
Prior to the Business Combination, given the absence of a public trading market, the Company’s board of directors considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of common stock at each meeting at which awards were approved. These factors include, but were not limited to, (i) contemporaneous valuations of common stock performed by an independent valuation specialist; (ii) developments in the Company’s business and stage of development; the 
99

Company’s operational and financial performance and condition; (iii) issuances of preferred stock and the rights and preferences of preferred stock relative to common stock; (iv) current condition of capital markets and the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or sale of the Company; and (v) the lack of marketability of the Company’s common stock. For financial reporting purposes, the Company considers the amount of time between the valuation date and the grant date to determine whether to use the latest common stock valuation or a straight-line interpolation between the two valuation dates. The determination includes an evaluation of whether the subsequent valuation indicates that any significant change in valuation had occurred between the previous valuation and the grant date.

WARRANTS
Marketing Warrants
On July 28, 2022, the Company entered into a warrant agreement with Zillow, Inc. (“Zillow”) in connection with a partnership arrangement that allows for Zillow to purchase up to 
6
 million shares of common stock that will vest in tranches (each, a “Tranche”) upon Zillow providing resale marketing services to the Company. Each Tranche will have an exercise price per share equal to the 
30
-day trailing volume weighted average price per share of Opendoor Common Stock (“VWAP”) prior to the vesting date of that Tranche, subject to a $
15
 floor and $
30
 cap per share. After a Tranche has vested, the Tranche can be exercised via a cash payment or a cashless exercise; provided that the Company has the option to cash settle any exercise. The warrant expires in July 2027, subject to extension for an additional Tranche and early termination under limited circumstances. Zillow began providing marketing services under the partnership arrangement in March 2023. As of December 31, 2024, 
no
 warrant shares had vested.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company’s effective tax rate differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory and state income tax rates to net loss before income tax, primarily as the result of state income taxes, stock-based compensation, and changes in the Company’s valuation allowance.
In December 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion Profit Shifting released Model Global Anti-Base Erosion rules (“Model Rules”) under Pillar Two. The Model Rules set forth the “common approach” for a Global Minimum Tax at 15 percent for multinational enterprises with a turnover of more than 750 million Euros. Rules under Pillar Two were effective from January 1, 2024. The Company does not expect adoption of Pillar Two rules to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements during fiscal year 2024.

A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in a particular tax jurisdiction. All available evidence, both positive and negative, is considered to determine whether, based on the weight of that evidence, a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a deferred tax asset. Due to the losses the Company generated in the current and prior years, the Company believes it is not more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets can be realized for its U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. Accordingly, the Company established and recorded a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets of $
795
 million as of December 31, 2024 and a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets of $
718
 million as of December 31, 2023. The valuation allowance increased by $
77
 million and $
54
 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively primarily as a result of current year losses.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had U.S. federal and state net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of $
2.6
 billion and $
2.0
 billion, respectively, which will each begin to expire in 2034 if not utilized. For NOLs arising after December 31, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 limits a taxpayer’s ability to utilize NOL carryforwards to 80% of taxable income and can be carried forward indefinitely (carryback is generally prohibited). In the Company’s case, as of December 31, 2024, $
2.5
 billion of US. federal NOLs and $
659
 million of state NOLs have an unlimited carryover period. NOLs generated in tax years beginning before January 1, 2018 will not be subject to the taxable income limitation and will continue to have a two-year carryback and twenty-year carryforward period. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, the Company had U.S. federal research tax credit carryforwards of $
45
 million that begin to expire in 2034. The Company also had state research tax credit carryforwards of $
30
 million with an indefinite carryforward period.
Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) limits the use of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 382 and similar state provisions. The Company performed an ownership analysis and identified three previous ownership changes in 2014, 2016 and 2020, as defined under Section 382 and 383 of the IRC, however none of the previous 
102
TABLE OF CONTENTS
OPENDOOR TECHNOLOGIES INC.

(Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts, ratios, or as noted)
ownership changes resulted in a material limitation that will reduce the total amount of net operating loss carryforwards and credits that can be utilized.

Due to the full valuation allowance at December 31, 2024, current adjustments to the unrecognized tax benefit will have no impact on the Company’s effective income tax rate. There would be an impact of $
23
 million to the effective tax rate if adjustments are made after the valuation allowance is released. The Company does not anticipate any significant change in its uncertain tax positions within 12 months of this reporting date.
The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax benefits as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interest and penalties with the related income tax liability on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. To date, the Company has not recognized nor accrued for any material interest and penalties in its consolidated statements of operations. The Company is subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States, and foreign income taxes in Canada and India. Due to the history of net operating losses, the Company is subject to U.S. federal, state and local examinations by tax authorities for all years since incorporation. As of December 31, 2024, the Company is not currently under any audits that would materially change the unrecognized tax benefits recorded.
The Company has not provided U.S. income or foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024, because it intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside of the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability will be immaterial, due to the participation exemption put in place under the Tax Act.
15.
NET LOSS PER SHARE
Basic net loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. During the periods when there is a net loss, potentially dilutive common stock equivalents have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share as their effect is anti-dilutive. 
No
 dividends were declared or paid for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, or 2022.
The Company uses the two-class method to calculate net loss per share and apply the more dilutive of the two-class method, treasury stock method or if-converted method to calculate diluted net loss per share. Undistributed earnings for each period are allocated to participating securities, based on the contractual participation rights of the security to share in the current earnings as if all current period earnings had been distributed. As there is no contractual obligation for participating securities to share in losses, the Company’s basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding during periods with undistributed losses.

DECONSOLIDATION
On July 31, 2024, a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, Mainstay Labs Inc. (“Mainstay”), formerly Open Exchange Labs Inc., issued its Series A Preferred Stock to third-party investors (the “Private Investment”). Mainstay is a market intelligence and transaction platform for the single-family rental industry. As a result of the Private Investment, the Company no longer had a controlling financial interest in Mainstay in accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, and Mainstay was deconsolidated from the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of July 31, 2024 (the “Deconsolidation”). 
The Company determined that the Deconsolidation does not meet the criteria requiring presentation as discontinued operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP because it does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company’s operations or financial results.
Upon Deconsolidation, the Company recognized a $
14
 million gain in Other income (loss) – net in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024, which represented the fair value of the Company’s retained interest in Mainstay less the carrying value of Mainstay’s net assets and the Company’s liabilities due to Mainstay as of July 31, 2024. The Company’s retained interest in Mainstay as of July 31, 2024 was recognized as a non-marketable equity security investment under ASC 321, Investment – Equity Securities. As of December 31, 2024, the retained interest in Mainstay was $
39
 million, which is presented in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The investment is measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, with the fair value initially determined as of the transaction date. There have been no indicators of impairment or other observable price changes since that date. The fair value on the transaction date was calculated using the option pricing method utilizing a back-solve methodology to infer the total equity value based on the pricing of the Private Investment. See 
“Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 1. Description of Business and Accounting Policies – Investments.”
See “Note 17 — Related Parties” for further information on the Company’s ongoing relationship and transactions with Mainstay.
17.
RELATED PARTIES

As a result of the Company’s continued investment in Mainstay, transactions between the Company and Mainstay subsequent to the Deconsolidation are considered to be related-party transactions. Prior to the Deconsolidation, transactions between Mainstay and Opendoor were eliminated upon consolidation. 
104
TABLE OF CONTENTS

(Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts, ratios, or as noted)
Subsequent to the Deconsolidation:
•
Mainstay provides property tax compliance services (“Property Tax Services”) and brokerage services (“Brokerage Services”) to the Company in the normal course of business, which were 
nominal
 for the year ended December 31, 2024. 
•
The Company is providing certain transition administrative services for a limited period of time to Mainstay (“Transition Services”) which are being paid on a quarterly basis in arrears, in the form of Mainstay Series A Preferred Stock at the original Series A Preferred Stock issuance price. Services provided for the year ended December 31, 2024 were 
immaterial
.
•
The Company has no compensation arrangements with the management of Mainstay who are responsible for directing the activities that most significantly impact the economics of Mainstay (“Mainstay Management”). As of the Deconsolidation, outstanding Opendoor RSUs held by Mainstay employees, other than Mainstay Management, were modified so that the service-based vesting requirement will be satisfied as long as the Mainstay employee continues to provide services to Mainstay (“Post Deconsolidation RSUs”). For the year ended December 31, 2024 subsequent to Deconsolidation, 
932,163
 shares of common stock were issued to Mainstay employees for the settlement of RSUs, net of shares withheld for participant taxes. As of December 31, 2024, 
860,410
 RSUs remained unvested and outstanding. 
•
The Company is continuing to pay for the bonuses of certain Mainstay employees, other than Mainstay Management, through November 2025 (“Post Deconsolidation Bonuses”). Amounts paid during, and due as of, the year ended December 31, 2024 were 
immaterial
.

SEGMENT INFORMATION 
The Company is managed as a single operating and reportable segment on a consolidated basis, reflecting how the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) allocates resources and evaluates the Company’s financial information. The operating segment is the Company’s residential real estate product and service offerings. The Company determined that the Chief Executive Officer is the CODM, given their responsibility for making resource allocation decisions, assessing performance, making strategic operational decisions and managing the organization at a consolidated level. 
As the Company is managed as a single operating and reportable segment, the measure of segment profit or loss is consolidated net loss. The CODM utilizes the financial information below in assessing the segment’s performance and allocating resources. The measure of segment assets is reported on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as total assets.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts, ratios, or as noted)
There are various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business pending against the Company, some of which seek damages and other relief which, if granted, may require future cash expenditures. In addition, from time to time the Company receives inquiries and audit requests from various government agencies and fully cooperates with these requests. The Company does not believe that it is reasonably possible that the resolution of these matters would result in any liability that would materially affect the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial condition except as noted below.
On October 7, 2022 and November 22, 2022, purported securities class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, captioned 
Alich v. Opendoor Technologies Inc., et al.
 (Case No. 2:22-cv-01717-JFM) (“Alich”) and 
Oakland County Voluntary Employee’s Beneficiary Association, et al. v. Opendoor Technologies Inc., et al. 
(Case No. 2:22-cv-01987-GMS) (“Oakland County”), respectively. The lawsuits were consolidated into a single action, captioned 
In re Opendoor Technologies Inc. Securities Litigation
 (Case No. 2:22-CV-01717-MTL). The consolidated amended complaint names as defendants the Company, Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings Corp. II (“SCH”), certain of the Company’s current and former officers and directors and the underwriters of a securities offering the Company made in February 2021. The complaint alleges that the Company and certain officers violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5, and that the Company, SCH, certain officers and directors and the underwriters violated Section 11 of the Securities Act, in each case by making materially false or misleading statements related to the effectiveness of the Company’s pricing algorithm. The plaintiffs also allege that certain defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Section 15 of the Securities Act, respectively, which provide for control person liability. The complaint asserts claims on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased, or otherwise acquired, Company common stock between December 21, 2020 and November 3, 2022 or pursuant to offering documents issued in connection with our business combination with SCH and the secondary public offering conducted by the Company in February 2021. The plaintiffs seek class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of interest and reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper. The defendants filed motions to dismiss on June 30, 2023, which the court granted on February 27, 2024 without prejudice. On May 14, 2024, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration of certain portions of the court’s order dismissing the complaint. The court’s orders on the motion to dismiss and motion for reconsideration dismissed all Exchange Act claims and Securities Act claims except for a portion of plaintiffs’ claims brought under Section 11 and Section 15 of the Securities Act. Defendants filed answers to the complaint on July 12, 2024. The plaintiffs and the defendant participated in a mediation in February 2025 following which the Company proposed a settlement offer to resolve all claims in the consolidated action on a class-wide basis, which is within the limits of insurance coverage. Accordingly, pursuant to applicable accounting requirements, the Company has recorded a liability reflecting the proposed settlement amount. If the offer is not accepted, or a settlement cannot be reached or if a proposed settlement is not approved by the court, the Company intends to vigorously defend itself in the matter. 
On March 1, 2023 and March 15, 2023, shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, captioned 
Carlson v. Rice, et al.
 (Case No. 2:23-cv-00367-GMS) and 
Van Dorn v. Wu, et al.
 (Case No. 2:23-cv-00455-DMF), respectively, which were subsequently consolidated into a single action, captioned 
Carlson v. Rice
 (Case No. 2:23-CV-00367-GMS). Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the matter on June 22, 2023, and thereafter re-filed complaints in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned 
Carlson v. Rice, et al. 
(Case No. 2023-0642) and 
Van Dorn v. Rice, et al.
 (Case No. 2023-0643). The cases have been consolidated into a single action, captioned 
Opendoor Technologies Inc. Stockholder Derivative Litigation
 (Case No. 2023-0642). The consolidated derivative action has been stayed pending further developments in 
In re Opendoor Technologies Inc. Securities Litigation
.
On June 29, 2023, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned 
Juul v. Wu, et al.
 (Case No. 1:23-cv-00705-UNA). The complaints in each matter are based on the same facts and circumstances as 
In re Opendoor Technologies Inc. Securities Litigation
 and name certain officers and directors of the Company as defendants. The defendants are alleged to have violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5 and breached fiduciary duties. The plaintiffs seek to maintain the derivative actions on behalf of the Company, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an order directing the Company to reform its corporate governance and internal procedures, restitutionary relief, an award of interest and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper. This derivative action has been stayed pending further developments in 
In re Opendoor Technologies Inc. Securities Litigation
.
On October 13, 2023, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, captioned 
Woods, et al. v. Bain, et al
. (Case No. 1:23-cv-01158-UNA). The complaint is based on facts and circumstances related to 
In re Opendoor Technologies Inc. Securities Litigation
. The plaintiffs have brought claims against certain current and former directors and officers of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, contribution under Sections 10(b) 
107

and 21D of the Exchange Act, SEC Rule 10b-5, violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The plaintiffs seek to maintain the derivative action on behalf of the Company, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an order directing one of the defendants to disgorge monies allegedly obtained from certain personal sales of Company stock, equitable relief, an award of interest and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper. This derivative action has been stayed pending further developments in 
In re Opendoor Technologies Inc. Securities Litigation
.
On October 18, 2023, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, captioned 
Gera v. Palihapitiya, et al
. (Case No. 2:23-cv-02164-SMB). The complaint is based on facts and circumstances related to 
In re Opendoor Technologies Inc. Securities Litigation
, and names as defendants certain current and former officers and directors of the Company and SCH Sponsor II LLC. The complaint alleges that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The plaintiff seeks to maintain the derivative action on behalf of the Company, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an order directing the Company to reform certain corporate governance and internal procedures, restitution, an award of cost and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and other and further relief as the court may deem just and proper. The defendants filed motions to dismiss on February 8, 2024, which were granted without prejudice on August 14, 2024, and the plaintiff filed an amended complaint on September 12, 2024. On October 28, 2024, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint, which are pending before the court. 
A global mediation of all pending shareholder derivative lawsuits based on the same facts and circumstances as In re Opendoor Technologies Inc. Securities Litigation was held on February 7, 2025. The parties agreed in principle that Opendoor would adopt certain corporate governance reforms as part of a potential global resolution of the shareholder derivative lawsuits and in exchange for a full release of claims. The Company expects that the payment of any court-approved attorneys’ fees and costs would be funded by proceeds from applicable insurance policies. If the settlement is not consummated or approved by the relevant courts, the Company and its officers and directors intend to vigorously defend themselves in the litigation.

RESTRUCTURING
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 the Company initiated workforce reductions to align its capacity with volume expectations, streamline the organization and focus its investments to support its growth plans. These actions were undertaken to optimize costs while preserving the flexibility needed to support future scaling of the business.
On November 7, 2024, the Company announced a workforce reduction of approximately 
300
 employees, representing 
17
% of its workforce at that time as part of a reorganization aimed at prioritizing strategic growth and driving long-term efficiencies (“2024 Restructuring”). The Company is providing post-employment benefits to impacted employees for a total cash cost of approximately $
10
 million. In addition to the workforce reduction, the Company incurred $
3
 million of costs related to the early termination of certain leases, and incurred $
4
 million in expenses associated with other activities related to the Company’s cost reduction efforts. Payments related to the 2024 Restructuring began in December 2024 and are expected to continue into 2025.
In 2023, the Company initiated workforce reductions, impacting approximately 
680
 employees. The Company provided severance and other termination benefits (“Post-Employment Benefits”) to impacted employees for a total expense of approximately $
14
 million. Payments related to this workforce reduction were substantially completed as of December 31, 2023.
In November 2022, the Company initiated a workforce reduction of 
550
 employees, which included: (i) reducing the Company’s headcount by 
18
% and (ii) winding down of our mortgage lending and brokerage services. The Company provided Post-Employment Benefits to impacted employees and incurred costs to wind down mortgage services for a total expense of $
17
 million. Payments related to this workforce reduction were substantially completed as of December 31, 2022.
The following table presents the activity of the restructuring liability (in millions). As of December 31, 2024, the remaining $
7
 million in restructuring costs, presented within the Restructuring costs line in the consolidated statements of operations, is included within Accounts payable and other accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
OPENDOOR TECHNOLOGIES INC.
Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.
None. 
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on the evaluation,

our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024.
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management, under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. 
Our management evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, which is included below.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Opendoor Technologies Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Opendoor Technologies Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
