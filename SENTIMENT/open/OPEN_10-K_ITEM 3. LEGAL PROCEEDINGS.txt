Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the effect of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this report may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.
As a result of a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those described in Part I. Item 1A “ Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results or performance may be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Additionally, our discussion of certain environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) assessments, goals and related issues in this or other disclosures is informed by various ESG standards and frameworks (including standards for the measurement of underlying data) and the interests of various stakeholders. As such, such information may not, and should not be interpreted as necessarily being, “material” under the federal securities laws for SEC reporting purposes. Furthermore, much of this information is subject to assumptions, estimates or third-party information that is still evolving and subject to change.
SUMMARY RISK FACTORS
Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that represent challenges that we face in connection with the successful implementation of our strategy and the growth of our business. Below is a summary of material factors that may offset our competitive strengths or have a negative effect on our business strategy or operating results, which could cause a decline in the price of shares of our common stock. Importantly, this summary does not address all of the risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional discussion of the risks and uncertainties summarized in this risk factor summary, as well as other risks and uncertainties that we face, can be found under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10‑K. The below summary is qualified in its entirety by that more complete discussion of such risks and uncertainties.
•
Our business and operating results have been and may in the future be significantly impacted by general economic conditions, the health of the U.S. residential real estate industry and risks associated with our real estate assets.
•
We have a history of losses, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.
•
We operate in a competitive and fragmented industry that could impair our ability to attract users of our products, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.
•
Our business is dependent upon our ability to appropriately price and manage our portfolio of inventory. An ineffective pricing or portfolio management strategy may have a material adverse effect on our business, sales, and results of operations. 
•
Our business is dependent upon our ability to expeditiously sell inventory. Failure to expeditiously sell our inventory could have an adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.
•
We may be unable to realize expected benefits from our restructuring and cost reduction efforts and our business might be adversely affected.

Declining real estate values have resulted in, and could continue to result in, inventory valuation adjustments, which have and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.
•
Our growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.

Our business is dependent upon access to desirable inventory. Obstacles to acquiring attractive inventory, whether because of supply, competition, macroeconomic conditions, or other factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations.
•
We process, store and use Personal Information (as defined herein) and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, and violation of these privacy obligations could result in a claim for damages, regulatory action, loss of business, or unfavorable publicity. 
•
We operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws, rules and regulations or to obtain and maintain required licenses, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
We are, and may in the future be, subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.
•
We utilize a significant amount of debt and financing arrangements in the operation of our business. Our cash flows and operating results could be adversely affected by required payments of debt or related interest and other risks of our debt financing.
