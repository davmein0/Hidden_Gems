ITEM 5.  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
($ in thousands, except for holders of record, beneficial owners, and per share data)
Market Information. 
Since August 1, 2007, our common stock has been listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol, “SHOO”. Prior to then, it was listed on the NASDAQ National Market. 
Holders. 
As of February 21, 2025, there were 169 holders of record and 41,589 beneficial owners of our common stock.
Dividends.
 Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, we began paying a quarterly cash dividend on our outstanding shares of common stock. At the end of March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a precautionary measure, our Board of Directors temporarily suspended the payment of dividends. In February 2021, our Board of Directors approved the reinstatement of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15, and in February 2022, increased the quarterly cash dividend to $0.21 per share on our outstanding shares of common stock, which was approved and paid with respect to each subsequent quarter. During fiscal 2024, a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share on our outstanding shares of common stock was paid on each of March 22, 2024, June 21, 2024, September 23, 2024, and December 27, 2024. The aggregate cash dividend paid for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 was $61,039. 
In February 2025, our Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share payable on March 21, 2025 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 10, 2025. The payment of future dividends will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be contingent upon future earnings, our financial condition, capital requirements, general business conditions, and other factors. Therefore, we can give no assurance that dividends of any kind will be paid to holders of our common stock in the future.
Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities. 
Our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the “Share Repurchase Program”), effective as of January 1, 2004. The Share Repurchase Program does not have a fixed expiration or termination date and may be modified or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. On several occasions the Board of Directors has increased the amount authorized for repurchase of our common stock. On November 2, 2021, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the Company's share repurchase authorization of approximately $200,000, bringing the total authorization to $250,000, which included the amount remaining under the prior authorization. The Share Repurchase Program permits us to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases or in privately negotiated transactions at such prices and times as are determined to be in our best interest. In the middle of March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as a precautionary measure the Board of Directors temporarily suspended the repurchase of our common stock, which the Board of Directors reinstated on February 24, 2021. On May 8, 2023, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the Company's share repurchase authorization of approximately $189,900, bringing the total authorization to $250,000. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased an aggregate of 2,090 shares of our common stock under the Share Repurchase Program, at a weighted average price per share of $43.15, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $90,153, which includes the amount remaining under the prior authorization. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $85,310 remained available for future repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program. The following table presents the total number of shares of our common stock, $0.0001 par value, purchased by us during the three months ended December 31, 2024, the average price paid per share, the amount of shares purchased pursuant to our Share Repurchase Program and the approximate dollar value of the shares that still could have been purchased at the end of the fiscal period pursuant to our Share Repurchase Program. See Note 10 – Share Repurchase Program to the consolidated financial statements for further details on our share repurchase program. During the three months ended December 31, 2024, there were no sales by us of unregistered shares of common stock.

  The Steven Madden, Ltd. 2019 Incentive Compensation Plan and its predecessor plan, the Steven Madden, Ltd. Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan, each provide us with the right to deduct, or withhold, or require employees to remit to us, an amount sufficient to satisfy all or part of the tax withholding obligations applicable to stock-based compensation awards. To the extent permitted, participants may elect to satisfy all or part of such withholding obligations by tendering to us previously owned shares or by having us withhold shares having a fair market value equal to the minimum statutory tax-withholding rate that could be imposed on the transaction. Included in this table are shares withheld during the fourth quarter of 2024 in connection with the settlement of vested restricted stock to satisfy tax-withholding requirements with an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2,685.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Business Overview
($ in thousands, except for store count and per share data)
Steven Madden, Ltd. and its subsidiaries designs, sources, and markets fashion-forward branded and private label footwear, accessories, and apparel. We distribute our products through the wholesale channel to department stores, mass merchants, off-price retailers, shoe chains, online retailers, national chains, specialty retailers, independent stores, and clubs throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Europe. Additionally, the Company operates in other international markets through its joint ventures in South Africa, the Middle East, Israel, various countries in Europe, Latin America, and certain countries in Asia, and through special distribution arrangements in various European countries, North Africa, South and Central America, and various countries within the Asia-Pacific region. We also distribute our products through our direct-to-consumer channel, which includes company-operated retail stores and e-commerce websites, in the United States, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, the Middle East, Israel, various countries in Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Our product offerings include a diverse range of contemporary styles, designed to establish or capitalize on market trends, complemented by core product offerings. We are recognized for our design creativity and ability to deliver trend-right products with high quality at accessible price points, efficiently and within short lead times. 
The Company’s reportable operating segments consist of the following:
•
Wholesale Footwear. 
This segment designs, sources, and markets our brands and sells our products to department stores, mass merchants, off-price retailers, shoe chains, online retailers, national chains, specialty retailers, independent stores, and clubs throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Europe, and through our joint ventures and international distributor network.
•
Wholesale Accessories/Apparel. 
This segment designs, sources, and markets our brands and sells our products, primarily consisting of handbags and apparel, to department stores, mass merchants, off-price retailers, online retailers, specialty retailers, independent stores, and clubs throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Europe, and through our joint ventures and international distributor network.
•
Direct-to-Consumer.

This segment engages in the sale of footwear, handbags, apparel, and other accessories through Steve Madden and Dolce Vita full-price retail stores, Steve Madden outlet stores, directly-operated concessions in international markets, and directly-operated e-commerce websites. We operate retail locations in regional malls and shopping centers, as well as high streets in various cities across the United States, Canada, Mexico, and through our joint ventures in international markets.
•
Licensing.
 This segment engages in the licensing of the Steve Madden
®
 and Betsey Johnson
®
 trademarks for use in the sale of select apparel, accessories, and home categories as well as various other non-core products.
As of January 2023, the Company no longer serves as a buying agent for any of its customers, and as a result, no longer reports under the First Cost segment. This change is not considered to have a material or meaningful impact on the Company's operations. 
Corporate does not constitute a reportable segment and includes costs not directly attributable to the reportable operating segments. These expenses are primarily related to corporate executives, corporate finance, corporate social responsibility, legal, human resources, information technology, cybersecurity, and other shared services.
Recent Developments
Acquisition of the ATM Collection.
 In November 2024, we expanded our brand portfolio and business operations by acquiring the ATM Collection ("ATM") for approximately $9,783. ATM is a lifestyle brand specializing in elevated basics for men and women. This acquisition strengthens our presence in the high-end fashion market and aligns with our strategic growth initiatives. ATM is based in the United States and is included within our Wholesale Accessories/Apparel and Direct-to-Consumer segments.

Joint Venture.

In October 2024, we formed a joint venture with Luxury Ventures Pte. Ltd, a well-known distributor of luxury and retail goods throughout Southeast Asia, acquiring a 51.0% controlling financial interest in SM Distribution Singapore Pte. Ltd. with a contribution of $1,020. This joint venture was formed with the intention to distribute Steve Madden’s products primarily through retail and e-commerce channels throughout Singapore. This joint venture is included within our Direct-to-Consumer segment.
Joint Venture.

In August 2024, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 49.0% non-controlling interest in our China joint venture in the amount of $1,500. The China joint venture was formed in 2019 and is the exclusive distributor of our products in China.
Acquisition of Kurt Geiger
. 
On February 12, 2025, the Company entered into a sale and purchase deed (the “Purchase Agreement”), by and among SML UK Holding Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Steve Madden and various entities comprising the Fifth Cinven Fund, Bain & Company, Inc., Squam Lake Investors X LP, and certain individuals, pursuant to which the Purchaser has agreed to acquire the entire issued share capital of Mercury Acquisitions Topco Limited, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of Jersey and the holding company for the Kurt Geiger business. 
The Company intends to fund the acquisition through a combination of debt financing and Steve Madden cash. In connection with and concurrently with the entry into the Purchase Agreement, Steve Madden entered into a commitment letter (the "Commitment Letter"), dated February 12, 2025, with Citizens Bank, JPMorgan Chase Bank, and Citibank (the "Commitment Parties"), pursuant to which, among other things, the Commitment Parties have committed to provide debt financing for the Transaction, consisting of senior secured credit facilities of up to an aggregate total of $550,000, which includes a $300,000 term loan and a $250,000 revolving credit facility, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter. The obligations of the Commitment Parties to provide debt financing under the Commitment Letter are subject to a number of customary conditions including, without limitation, execution and delivery of definitive documentation consistent with the Commitment Letter. Refer to Note 21 – Subsequent Events for further details. 
Macroeconomic Conditions and Industry Trends
The global economy and retail sector are influenced by a range of factors that impact consumer behavior and business operations. Persistent inflation, high interest rates, foreign currency fluctuations, bank failures, and recession concerns continue to affect consumer discretionary income, spending habits, and overall sentiment in the United States and key international markets. In response to these pressures, many retailers, particularly in the United States, have adopted more aggressive promotional strategies to offset declines in foot traffic, improve conversion rates, and manage elevated inventory levels.
The department store sector has undergone significant structural changes, including consolidations, restructurings, bankruptcies, and an increase in store closures. At the same time, the geopolitical landscape remains uncertain, with recent political transitions potentially affecting international trade relations, tax and import regulations, and broader economic stability. These factors could create headwinds for our global business performance. 
Additionally, ongoing military conflicts have contributed to inflationary pressures, unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, rising energy costs, food shortages, and financial market volatility, all of which influence consumer confidence. While these conflicts led to our voluntary suspension of operations in Russia and a limited presence in Israel, they have not had a material impact on our financial statements. However, the broader economic ramifications of these conflicts remain a factor in shaping the retail environment in which we operate.
In response to these ongoing challenges, we are executing the following key strategic initiatives, which are aimed at driving growth and improving operational efficiency:
•
Winning with product.
 Utilizing our proven model – which combines talented design teams, a test-and react strategy, and industry-leading speed-to-market capability – to create trend-right product assortments across footwear, accessories and apparel categories that resonate with the consumer.
•
Investing in marketing.
 Continue investing in full-funnel marketing to deepen our connection with consumers.
•
Expanding in international markets.
 Expanding our international businesses in the Americas (ex. U.S.), EMEA and APAC regions.
•
Growing non-footwear categories.
 Expanding our product offerings across various categories outside of footwear, including handbags, accessories, and apparel.
•
Expanding Direct-to-Consumer led by digital.
 Expanding our direct-to-consumer business with a focus on growing our digital business, including by optimizing our site functionality, personalization, and digital marketing, to enhance the consumers overall shopping experience.
•
Operational Efficiency.
 Streamlining operations, tightly managing costs, and maintaining a disciplined inventory management approach are ongoing and aimed at enhancing overall profitability.
24
•
Sustainability Focus.
 Committing to our corporate social responsibility initiatives, as we work to minimize the negative impacts we have on the environment and maximize the positive impacts we have on our people and our communities.
Inflation
Our actual results could be materially and adversely impacted by ongoing inflationary pressures, as well as broader macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, including the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Inflation has contributed to higher costs for raw materials, labor, and logistics, which in turn have impacted consumer spending patterns and overall demand for our product. These pressures have negatively impacted both our wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses, and may continue to do so despite efforts by central banks around the world, including in the United States, to combat inflation. Historically, we have mitigated the impact of rising costs through price adjustments, supplier negotiations, cost optimization initiatives, and operational efficiencies. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to fully offset future inflationary pressures, which could impact our profitability, margins, and overall financial performance.
Tariffs
In February 2025, the U.S. administration announced a 10% tariff on imports from China, where a significant portion of our products is sourced, with an effective date of February 4
th
, 2025, and further announced that an additional 10% tariff on imports from China and a potential 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada are scheduled to take effect on March 4
th
, 2025. We are closely monitoring this evolving situation and evaluating our response, which may include shifts in sourcing strategies, price adjustments, or other cost-mitigation measures. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully mitigate the impact of such tariffs or trade restrictions. Future impacts are unknown at this time and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For further discussion of related risks, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
Dividends
Our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share on our outstanding shares of common stock which was paid on March 22, 2024, June 21, 2024, September 23, 2024, and December 27, 2024. The aggregate cash dividends paid for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 was $61,039.
On February 25, 2025, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share payable on March 21, 2025 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 10, 2025.
2024 Highlights
Total revenue for 2024 was $2,282,927, an increase of 15.2% as compared to 2023. Net income attributable to Steven Madden, Ltd. was $169,390 in 2024 compared to $171,554 in 2023. Our effective tax rate for 2024 was 23.7% compared to 21.1% in 2023.

This increase resulted from the opening of 54 brick-and-mortar stores, mostly in international markets, and one e-commerce website, offset by the closure of 18 brick-and-mortar stores and one e-commerce website. The Company also operated 42 concessions in international markets as of December 31, 2024, up from 25 concessions at the end of 2023.
Our inventory turnover (calculated on a trailing four quarter average) was 5.6 times for both the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

As we look ahead, we remain focused on delivering trend-right product, deepening connections with our consumers, growing our international business, expanding our non-footwear categories, enhancing our digital commerce business, strengthening our core U.S. wholesale business, and efficiently managing our inventory and expenses, while continuing to make meaningful progress on our corporate social responsibility initiatives.

The following section discusses our results of operations for 2024 and 2023 and year-to-year comparisons between those periods. Discussions of 2022 and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and can be found within Part II, Item 7., “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 4, 2024.
Year Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023
Consolidated
Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased 15.2% to $2,282,927 compared to $1,981,582 in 2023, driven by growth in the Wholesale Accessories/Apparel, Direct-to-Consumer, and Wholesale Footwear segments. 
Gross profit in 2024 was $936,932, or 41.0% of total revenue, as compared to $832,414, or 42.0% of total revenue, in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of total revenue was driven by the acquisition of Almost Famous and a greater mix of the private label footwear business. In 2024 and 2023, gross profit included $435 and $2,023, respectively, related to the fair value step-up of inventory from acquired businesses. 
Operating expenses in 2024 were $698,936, or 30.6% of total revenue, as compared to $612,672, or 30.9% of total revenue, in 2023. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue was primarily attributable to expense leverage on a higher revenue base. Operating expenses in 2024 included an expense of $6,378 related to acquisition costs, the formation of new international joint ventures, and the reorganization of foreign entities, $3,377 related to legal costs as a result of litigation settlements and earnout-related litigation, $3,199 related to a loss on the divestiture of a business, $1,758 related to certain severances and termination benefits, and $326 of working capital adjustment in connection with the Almost Famous acquisition. Operating expenses in 2023 included $3,803 related to certain severances, termination benefits, and a corporate office relocation, acquisition costs of $2,443 primarily for Almost Famous and the formation of international joint ventures, and $538 related to the dissolution of an entity in Asia. In 2024, we also recorded a pre-tax charge of $10,335 related to the impairment of trademarks and an expense of $2,722 due to the change in valuation of a contingent consideration liability. In 2023, we also recorded a pre-tax charge of $6,520 related to the impairment of a trademark. 
Income from operations in 2024 increased to $224,939, or 9.9% of total revenue, as compared to $213,222, or 10.8% of total revenue, in 2023. The effective tax rate for 2024 was 23.7% compared to 21.1% in 2023. The increase was primarily due to a lower tax benefit related to equity-based awards and an increase in pre-tax income in jurisdictions with higher tax rates. Net income attributable to Steven Madden, Ltd. in 2024 was $169,390 compared to $171,554 in 2023. 
Wholesale Footwear Segment
Revenue from the Wholesale Footwear segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $1,059,440, or 46.4% of total revenue, as compared to $1,048,448, or 52.9% of total revenue, in 2023. The increase of 1.0% was primarily driven by growth in our private label business partially offset by a decline in the branded business. 
Gross profit in 2024 was $366,601, or 34.6% of Wholesale Footwear revenue, compared to $370,631, or 35.4% of Wholesale Footwear revenue, in 2023. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to a greater mix of our private label business. 
Operating expenses in 2024 were $175,389, or 16.6% of Wholesale Footwear revenue, as compared to $165,681, or 15.8% of Wholesale Footwear revenue, in 2023. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of Wholesale Footwear revenue was mainly due to higher payroll-related expenses. Operating expenses in 2024 included $1,161 related to legal costs as a result of certain litigation settlements, $387 related to certain severances and termination benefits, and $278 related to acquisition costs and the formation of new international joint ventures. Operating expenses in 2023 included costs of $2,712 related to the dissolution of an entity in Asia, $1,546 related to certain severances, termination benefits, and a corporate office relocation, and $929 related to the formation of new international joint ventures. 
Income from operations in 2024 was $191,212, or 18.0% of Wholesale Footwear revenue, compared to $204,950, or 19.5% of Wholesale Footwear revenue, in 2023.
Wholesale Accessories/Apparel Segment
Revenue from the Wholesale Accessories/Apparel segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $662,673, or 29.0% of total revenue, compared to $416,532, or 21.0% of total revenue, in 2023. The increase of 59.1% was primarily driven by the acquisition of Almost Famous and strength in the Steve Madden handbag business. 
27
Gross profit in 2024 was $212,997, or 32.1% of Wholesale Accessories/Apparel revenue, compared to $135,168, or 32.5% of Wholesale Accessories/Apparel revenue, in 2023. The decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was due to the addition of the Almost Famous business. In 2024 and 2023, gross profit included $435 and $2,023, respectively, related to the fair value step-up of inventory from acquired businesses.
Operating expenses in 2024 were $111,206, or 16.8% of Wholesale Accessories/Apparel revenue, as compared to $73,740, or 17.7% of Wholesale Accessories/Apparel revenue, in 2023. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of Wholesale Accessories/Apparel revenue was primarily attributable to expense leverage on a higher revenue base. Operating expenses in 2024 included $1,335 related to legal costs as result of litigation settlements and earnout-related litigation, $1,180 related to certain severances and termination benefits, $677 related to acquisition costs and the formation of new international joint ventures, and $326 of working capital adjustment in connection with the Almost Famous acquisition. Operating expenses in 2023 included acquisition costs of $1,505 for Almost Famous. In 2024, we also recorded a pre-tax charge of $8,635 related to the impairment of a trademark and an expense of $2,722 due to the change in valuation of a contingent consideration liability. 
Income from operations in 2024 was $90,434, or 13.6% of Wholesale Accessories/Apparel revenue, compared to $61,428, or 14.7% of Wholesale Accessories/Apparel revenue, in 2023.
Direct-to-Consumer Segment
Revenue from the Direct-to-Consumer segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $550,153, or 24.1% of total revenue, as compared to $506,494, or 25.6% of total revenue, in 2023. The increase of 8.6% was driven by growth in both our brick-and-mortar and e-commerce businesses. During 2024, we opened 54 brick-and-mortar stores and closed 18 resulting in a total of 291 brick-and-mortar stores as compared to 255 brick-and-mortar stores as of December 31, 2023. We also opened one e-commerce website and closed one e-commerce website ending the year with five e-commerce websites. Additionally, we operated 42 concessions in international markets as of December 31, 2024, up from 25 concessions at the end of 2023.
 Gross profit in 2024 was $346,673, or 63.0% of Direct-to-Consumer revenue, compared to $316,507, or 62.5% of Direct-to-Consumer revenue, in 2023. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to a reduction in promotional activity. 
Operating expenses in 2024 were $314,003, or 57.1% of Direct-to-Consumer revenue, compared to $279,827, or 55.2% of Direct-to-Consumer revenue, in 2023. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was attributable to higher marketing expenses and occupancy-related costs. Operating expenses in 2024 included $5,090 related to acquisition costs and the formation of new international joint ventures, $3,199 related to a loss on the divestiture of a business, and $515 related to legal costs as a result of litigation settlements. Operating expenses in 2023 included a benefit of $2,174 related to the dissolution of an entity in Asia. In 2024 and 2023, we also recorded pre-tax charges of $1,700 and $6,520, respectively, related to the impairment of a trademark. 
Income from operations in 2024 was $30,970, or 5.6% of Direct-to-Consumer revenue as compared to $30,160, or 6.0% of Direct-to-Consumer revenue, in 2023.
Licensing Segment
Royalty income from the Licensing segment for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $10,661, or 0.5% of total revenue, compared to $10,108, or 0.5% of total revenue, in 2023. Operating expenses were $1,600 in 2024 compared to $1,681 in 2023. Income from operations in 2024 was $9,061 compared to $8,427 in 2023.
Corporate
Corporate does not constitute a reportable segment and includes costs not directly attributable to the reportable operating segments. These expenses are primarily related to corporate executives, corporate finance, corporate social responsibility, legal, human resources, information technology, cybersecurity, and other shared services. Corporate operating expenses were $96,738 for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $91,743 in 2023. 
28
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $203,408 and $219,813 as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Of the total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of December 31, 2024, $119,569, or approximately 59%, was held in our foreign subsidiaries. Of the total cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as of December 31, 2023, $134,745, or approximately 61%, was held in our foreign subsidiaries. 
On July 22, 2020, we entered into a $150,000, five-year, asset-based revolving credit facility with various lenders and Citizens Bank (the “Credit Agreement”). On March 25, 2022, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement, which replaced the London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) with the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (“BSBY”) as the interest rate benchmark, among other changes. On April 3, 2023, we entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement, which reflects CIT Group/Commercial Services, Inc. (“CIT”) as an additional receivables collection agent for us and certain guarantors. Further, on October 23, 2023, we entered into a third amendment to the Credit Agreement in order to accommodate certain changes made to our existing factoring arrangement with CIT. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had working capital of $480,974, cash and cash equivalents of $189,924, short-term investments of $13,484, no cash borrowing, and $504 in letters of credit outstanding unrelated to the Credit Agreement.
We believe that based on our current financial position and available cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, we will meet all our financial commitments and operating needs for at least the next twelve months. In addition, our $150,000 asset-based revolving credit facility provides us with additional liquidity and flexibility on a long-term basis.
In connection with and concurrently with the entry into the acquisition of Kurt Geiger (the "Transaction"), we have entered into a commitment letter dated February 12, 2025 ("Commitment Letter"), with Citizens Bank, JPMorgan Chase Bank, and Citibank ("Commitment Parties") pursuant to which, among other things, the Commitment Parties have committed to provide debt financing for the Transaction, consisting of senior secured credit facilities of up to an aggregate total of $550,000, which includes a $300,000 term loan and a $250,000 revolving credit facility, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter.
Cash Flows
A summary of our cash provided by and used in operating, investing, and financing activities was as follows.
Operating Activities
Cash provided by operating activities was $198,096 for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $229,237 in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable changes in inventories, receivables, and deferred taxes, partially offset by favorable changes in accounts payable, and net income.
Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities was $39,493 for the year ended December 31, 2024, which was primarily attributed to capital expenditures of $25,911 for leasehold improvements, new stores, and systems enhancements; purchases of short-term investments of $21,405, and acquisitions of $13,976. This was partially offset by proceeds from the sale of short-term investments of $22,139.
Financing Activities
Cash used in financing activities was $167,906 for the year ended December 31, 2024, which was primarily attributable to share repurchases and net settlements of stock awards of $98,433, dividends paid of $61,039, and the payment of a contingent consideration liability of $8,547.

Dividends
In February 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share on our outstanding shares of common stock. The dividend was paid on March 22, 2024, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 8, 2024. We paid total cash dividends for the three months ended March 31, 2024 of $15,416.
In May 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share on our outstanding shares of common stock. The dividend was paid on June 21, 2024, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 10, 2024. We paid total cash dividends for the three months ended June 30, 2024 of $15,292.
In July 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share on our outstanding shares of common stock. The dividend was paid on September 23, 2024, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 13, 2024. We paid total cash dividends for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of $15,172.
In November 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share on our outstanding shares of common stock.

We paid total cash dividends for the three months ended December 31, 2024 of $15,159.
30
On February 25, 2025, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend. The quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share is payable on March 21, 2025 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 10, 2025.
Future quarterly cash dividend payments are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and contingent upon future earnings, our financial condition, capital requirements, general business conditions, and other factors. Therefore, we can give no assurance that dividends will be paid to holders of our common stock in the future.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE USE OF ESTIMATES
Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are the most significantly affected by judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: allowances for doubtful accounts; markdowns and chargeback allowances, co-op advertising allowances, customer returns; inventory valuation; the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets; and contingent consideration liabilities. Our estimates are made based upon historical factors, current and future circumstances and market conditions, and the experience and judgment of management. Assumptions and estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis, and we may employ outside experts to assist in the valuation process of our intangible assets and goodwill.
Allowances for doubtful accounts. 
A vast majority of our customers’ receivable balances are protected under our factoring and collection agency agreements with Rosenthal & Rosenthal, Inc. (“Rosenthal”) and CIT Group/Commercial Services, Inc. (“CIT”), described in Note 17 – Factoring Agreements to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Under this agreement, Rosenthal assumes the credit risk resulting from a customer’s financial inability to make payment of credit-approved receivables. We also use risk insurance, letters of credit, and put agreements to mitigate credit risk for a significant portion of the receivables not covered under our Rosenthal agreement. The balance of receivables not covered under our Rosenthal agreement is reduced by an allowance for amounts that may be uncollectible in the future. 
The estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is based on an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable, assessments of collectability based on historical trends, the financial condition of our customers, and an evaluation of economic conditions. Differences in management’s estimation of the above factors could impact our results of operations and financial position. The balances of allowances for doubtful accounts are generally correlated with our revenues from wholesale customers whose receivables are not covered under our Rosenthal agreement, and actual losses have historically been within our expectations and in line with the allowances we have established. The balances and activity in the allowances for doubtful accounts are presented in Note 20 – Valuation and Qualifying Accounts to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. A hypothetical 5% increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2024 would have increased our 2024 operating expenses by approximately $200. 
Markdowns, chargebacks, co-op advertising, and customer returns.
 As described in Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, we provide variable consideration to our wholesale customers to maximize sales of our product on the retail floor, in the form of markdowns and chargeback allowances, co-op advertising allowances, and return reserves related to the current period sales. 
a.
Markdowns and chargeback allowances.
 We evaluate anticipated customer markdowns and chargeback allowances by reviewing several performance indicators for our major customers. These performance indicators, which include inventory levels on the retail floors, sell through rates to the end consumer, and gross margin levels, are analyzed by management to estimate the amount of customer allowances. We also discuss product performance with our retail partners on an ongoing basis to gather more intelligence to inform our estimation process. Differences in management’s estimation of the above factors from period to period could impact our results of operations and financial position. The levels of markdown and chargeback allowances are generally correlated with our revenues to wholesale customers. A hypothetical 5% increase in the reserve balance for markdowns and chargeback allowances as of December 31, 2024 would have decreased our 2024 revenue by approximately $1,700.
b.
Co-op advertising allowances.
 Under our co-op advertising programs, we agree to reimburse the retailer for a portion of the costs incurred by the retailer to advertise and promote some of our products. We estimate the costs of co-op advertising programs based on the terms of the agreements with our customers. Differences in management’s estimation of the co-op advertising activity at our customers and the resulting amount of the reserve for these allowances from period to period could impact our results of operations and financial position. The level of co-op advertising support is generally correlated with our revenues to wholesale customers. A hypothetical 5% increase in the reserve balance for co-op advertising allowances as of December 31, 2024 would have an immaterial impact on our 2024 revenue.
c.
Return reserve.
 Our Direct-to-Consumer segment accepts unworn returns within 30 days from the date of a sale, or 30 days from the date of delivery for online orders. We estimate a return reserve in the Direct-to-Consumer segment by establishing a return rate using historical returns data. The rate is then applied to eligible revenues recorded in the current period to calculate the reserve. We do not accept returns as a normal business practice in our wholesale segments, except for our Blondo
®
 and Dolce Vita
®
 product lines. We estimate such returns based on historical experience and current market conditions. The level of returns is generally correlated with our revenues. A hypothetical 5% increase in the return reserve as of December 31, 2024 would have an immaterial impact on our 2024 revenue.
31
The balances and activity in the markdown, chargeback, co-op advertising allowances, and return reserves are included in Note 20 – Valuation and Qualifying Accounts to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. 
Inventory valuation. 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, on a first-in, first-out basis. We review inventory on a regular basis for excess and slow-moving inventory. The review is based on an analysis of the age and styles of inventory on hand, historical sales of the same or similar products, and expected net realizable value through future sales. The analysis includes a review of inventory quantities on hand at period-end in relation to year-to-date sales and projections for sales in the foreseeable future as well as subsequent sales and discussions with both traditional and off-price retailers. We consider quantities on hand in excess of estimated future sales to be at risk for market impairment. The estimated net realizable value is determined based on the estimate of selling prices of inventory through off-price and discount store channels, department stores, and our own direct-to-consumer channel. The likelihood of any material inventory write-down is dependent primarily on the expectation of future consumer demand for our products, which is influenced by consumer trends, economic and market conditions, and weather patterns for seasonal good. A misinterpretation or misunderstanding of future consumer demand for our products due to these or any other factors could result in inventory valuation changes compared to the valuation determined to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date. 
In general, our inventory obsolescence estimates have historically been within our expectations and in line with the reserves established, and although possible, significant variation is not expected in the future. A hypothetical 5% increase to inventory reserves as of December 31, 2024 would have decreased our 2024 gross profit by approximately $500.
Valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets
. We estimate and record the fair value of purchased intangible assets at the time of their acquisition. The fair values of these intangible assets are estimated based on independent third-party appraisals that are reviewed and approved by us. Goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. These assets are tested for impairment at least annually, on the first day of the third quarter, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and tested for impairment if indicators are present. 
Our annual impairment assessment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets is generally performed using a qualitative approach to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. Performance of the qualitative impairment assessment requires judgment in identifying and considering the significance of relevant events and circumstances including external factors, such as macroeconomic and industry conditions, and the legal and regulatory environment, as well as entity-specific factors, such as actual and planned financial performance, that could impact the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The results of our most recent quantitative tests are also considered in performing the qualitative assessment. 
If the results of the annual qualitative assessment conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its carrying value, or if interim indicators of impairment are identified, a quantitative impairment test is performed. 
A quantitative impairment test involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset with its carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded for an amount equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. For goodwill, the impairment loss is limited to the amount of the respective reporting unit’s allocated goodwill. Determination of the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including consideration of external factors, such as macroeconomic and industry conditions, and the legal and regulatory environment, as well as entity-specific factors such as actual and planned financial performance. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether an impairment charge is recognized and the amount of any such charge. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons, and recent transactions. These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows, discount rates, growth rates, and determination of appropriate market comparisons. It is possible that our conclusions regarding impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets could change in future periods if, for example, our businesses do not perform as projected or overall economic conditions in future periods vary from current assumptions.
Our annual impairment tests were last performed as of July 1, 2024, using a qualitative impairment test as described above, the results of which concluded that the fair values of its reporting units exceeded their carrying values and the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangibles exceeded their respective carrying values. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the fair values of our reporting units and our indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2024 would not have resulted in any material impairment charges. No goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges were recorded as a result of our annual impairment tests during any of the years presented in this Form 10-K. 
In the first quarter of 2024, circumstances occurred that caused a change in the estimated useful life of the GREATS
®
 trademark from an indefinite life to an estimated useful life of 10 years, and as a result, the Company performed an impairment test. The estimated fair value of this trademark was determined using an excess earnings method, incorporating the use of projected financial information and a discount rate of 14.0% which was developed using market participant-based assumptions. Changes in these significant unobservable inputs might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. As a result of this assessment, the GREATS
®
 trademark was written down from the carrying value of $6,150 to its fair value of $4,450, resulting in a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $1,700. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2024, the Company completed the sale of its GREATS business. As part of the divestiture, the remaining carrying amounts of the net 
32
intangible assets of GREATS, which included a trademark of $4,287 and customer relationships of $861, were written off. This was recorded within operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2024. 
Additionally, during the third quarter of 2024, the Company decided to discontinue the use of its Almost Famous brand and transition its marketing and sales efforts under the Madden Girl brand. As a result of this decision, the Company reassessed the carrying amount of its Almost Famous trademark for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other. Based on this assessment, the Company determined that the estimated future cash flows related to the Almost Famous trademark was less than its carrying value, and therefore, the asset was impaired. As such, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $8,635, representing the remaining carrying amount of the asset, which was recorded within Impairment of intangibles in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2024. Prior to writing off the Almost Famous trademark, it was recorded within our Wholesale Apparel/Accessories segment. 
See Note 7 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for further details.
Contingent consideration liabilities.
 We have completed acquisitions that may require us to make contingent consideration payments to the sellers based on the future financial performance of the acquired businesses over a period from one to five years. The fair values of the contingent consideration liabilities are estimated using the present values of management's projections of the financial results of the acquired businesses. Failure to correctly project the financial results of the acquired businesses could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. See Note 4 – Acquisitions, Purchases and Sales of Joint Ventures, and Divestitures and Note 5 – Fair Value Measurements to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for further details.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
($ in thousands)
Interest Rate Risk
We do not engage in the trading of market risk sensitive instruments in the normal course of our business. Our financing arrangements are subject to variable interest rates, primarily based on the prime rate and the BSBY. The terms of our $150,000 asset-based revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Facility”) and our collection agency agreements with Rosenthal & Rosenthal, Inc. and CIT Group/Commercial Services, Inc. can be found in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Item 7 and in Note 16 – Credit Agreement and Note 17 – Factoring Agreements, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. Because we had no cash borrowings under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2024, a 10% change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would have an immaterial effect on our reported interest expense.
As of December 31, 2024, we held short-term investments valued at $13,484, which consist of time deposits. We have the ability to hold these investments until maturity.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We face market risk to the extent that our U.S. or foreign operations involve the transaction of business in foreign currencies. In addition, our inventory purchases are primarily done in foreign jurisdictions and inventory purchases may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the local currencies of our contract manufacturers, which could have the effect of increasing the cost of goods sold in the future. We manage these risks primarily by denominating these purchases in U.S. dollars. To mitigate the risk of purchases that are denominated in foreign currencies we may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts for terms of no more than two years. A description of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included in Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 12 – Derivative Instruments to the consolidated financial statements.
As of December 31, 2024, we had entered into forward foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $90,031. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a model that measures the impact of a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our forward foreign exchange contracts that were outstanding as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, a 10% increase or decrease of the U.S. dollar against the exchange rates for foreign currencies under forward foreign exchange contracts, with all other variables held constant, would result in a net increase or decrease in the fair value of our derivatives portfolio of approximately $136, which is immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.
In addition, we are exposed to translation risk in connection with our foreign operations because our subsidiaries and joint ventures in these countries utilize the local currency as their functional currency, and those financial results are translated into U.S. dollars. As currency exchange rates fluctuate, foreign currency exchange rate translation adjustments reflected in our financial statements with respect to our foreign operations affects the comparability of financial results between years.
Inflation Risk
Inflationary factors generally affect us by reducing consumer spending, increasing our labor and overhead costs, and negatively impacting our direct sales to end consumers and our sales to our wholesale customers, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. We have historically been able to minimize the impacts of inflation by raising prices, renegotiating costs, changing suppliers, and improving operating efficiencies. However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to offset such inflationary impacts in the future.

ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
Management of Steven Madden, Ltd. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act).
Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, and effected by the Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness, as of the end of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation our management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Their attestation report appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting, as identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Steven Madden, Ltd.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Steven Madden, Ltd. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of 
December 31, 2024
 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 
December 31, 2024
, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at 
December 31, 2024
 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 
December 31, 2024
, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2024
, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical
 Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
F-1
Markdown Allowances
Description of the Matter
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, revenue recognized by the Company is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for goods, including estimates for variable consideration. Variable consideration includes markdown allowances which are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period in which revenues are recognized.  Estimating the amount of markdown allowances to be recorded requires management to review several performance indicators, including retailers’ inventory levels, sell-through rates and gross margin levels.
Auditing management's estimate of markdown allowances reserves was complex and judgmental as reserve amounts are sensitive to changes in market or economic conditions, and have a direct, material impact on the amount of revenue recognized by the Company. There is also significant estimation required to establish markdown reserve rates by brand and customer, which are based on the Company's review of periodic negotiations with each customer and the expected performance of the products in the customers' stores.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company’s process to calculate the markdown allowances, including the consideration of historical experience, actual and forecasted results, and current economic and market conditions.
To test the estimate of markdown allowances, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies and testing the assumptions regarding periodic negotiations with each customer, which include the application of market and economic conditions to individual customers and the expected performance of the products in the customers' stores, that were used by the Company to calculate the projected markdown allowances to be issued upon settlement. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current market and economic trends, historical results and other relevant factors.  We also examined the historical accuracy of management's estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to substantively test the changes in the estimate that would result from reasonable changes in the assumptions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Steven Madden, Ltd. 
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Steven Madden, Ltd. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Steven Madden, Ltd. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Steven Madden, Ltd. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Additionally, the Company consolidates the accounts of the following joint ventures, in which it holds a controlling financial interest: SM Dolce Limited (Hong Kong), SM Distribution Israel L.P. (Israel), SM Distribution Singapore Pte. Ltd. (Singapore), SM Distribution Latin America S. de R.L. (Latin America), Madden Operations Ltd. (Israel), Steve Madden South Africa Proprietary Limited (South Africa), AG SM Holdings Limited (Middle East), SM Fashion d.o.o. Beograd (Serbia), and BA Brand Holdings LLC (United States). 
The interests of non-controlling shareholders in these consolidated entities are presented as net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Statements of Income and as noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the following: the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Significant areas involving management estimates include inventory valuation, goodwill and other intangible assets valuation, and variable consideration as part of revenue recognition, including chargebacks, markdown allowances, discounts, returns, and compliance-related deductions. The Company estimates variable consideration by analyzing several performance indicators for its major customers, including retailers’ inventory levels, sell-through rates, and gross margin levels. Management continuously evaluates these factors to estimate anticipated chargebacks and allowances.

STEVEN MADDEN, LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash balances and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the date of purchase.
Short-Term Investments
Short-term investments consist of securities which the Company expects to convert into cash within one year, including time deposits with original maturities greater than three months but less than or equal to one year.
Inventories
Inventories consist of finished goods, both on hand and in transit, and are recorded at the lower of cost (determined using the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value.
Property and Equipment, Net
Property and equipment, net is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization including the impact of impairments and disposals. Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 
three
 to 
27.5
 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term. Refer to Note 6 – Property and Equipment for further information.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets, including property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets, are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Recoverability is evaluated by comparing the asset or asset group’s carrying value to the Company’s best estimate of undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying value is in excess of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the Company will measure any impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its fair value.
When estimating future cash flows, the Company considers various factors, including macroeconomic trends, consumer spending, capital investments, promotional activities, and advertising expenditures. As these estimates require significant judgment, actual results may differ, potentially leading to future impairments. Refer to Note 6 – Property and Equipment and Note 13 – Leases for further information.
Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model or market approach, depending on the availability of market data and the nature of the asset. Under the DCF model, significant assumptions include estimates of future cash flows and discount rates, which reflect the risks associated with the expected future cash flows. When sufficient market data is available, the Company may apply a market approach by considering comparable market transactions, quoted market prices for similar assets, or appraisals when available.

Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
The Company's goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually at the beginning of the third quarter, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. 
In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, impairment may be assessed using a qualitative evaluation of relevant factors, including historical and expected financial performance, macroeconomic and industry conditions, and the legal and regulatory environment. If qualitative factors suggest it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset or reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is performed. As part of its ongoing assessment, the Company periodically conducts a quantitative impairment analysis instead of a qualitative assessment. If the fair value of an intangible asset or reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized, limited to the intangible asset or reporting unit's carrying value. Refer to Note 7 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further information.
Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, typically ranging from 10 to 20 years, and are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present.

Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into operating income in the Consolidated Statements of Income during 2024, 2023, and 2022 were immaterial.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included within operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
 For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, advertising costs were $
101,954
, $
89,435
, and $
85,921
, respectively. 
Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies performance obligations identified under customer contracts, typically upon the transfer of control in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions of the sale. Most of the Company’s revenue is recognized at a point in time when the product is shipped to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for goods, including estimates for variable consideration. Variable consideration primarily includes markdown allowances, co-op advertising programs, and product returns. Revenue recognition policy by segment is described below. Refer to Note 19 – Operating Segment Information for disaggregated revenue by segment.
Wholesale Footwear and Wholesale Accessories/Apparel Segments. 
The Company generates revenue through the design, sourcing, and sale of branded and private label footwear, accessories, and apparel to both domestic and international customers who then sell the products to end consumers. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies performance obligations identified under the terms of customer contracts, typically upon the transfer of control of merchandise in accordance with contractual terms and conditions of the sale.
Direct-to-Consumer Segment.
 The Company generates revenue through the direct sale of branded footwear, apparel, and accessories to consumers. Revenue from physical store is recognized at the point of sale when the customer takes control of the goods and payment is received. E-commerce sales are recognized upon receipt of goods by the customer. 
Licensing Segment. 
The Company licenses various trademarks under agreements that allow licensees to manufacture, market, and sell select apparel, accessories, home goods, and other non-core products. License agreements require royalty and, in most cases, advertising fee payments, both of which are based on the greater of a minimum or a percentage of net revenues. For license agreements where the sales-based royalty exceeds the contractual minimum, revenue is recognized as licensed products are sold, based on reports from licensees. For agreements where the contractual minimum fee is not exceeded, revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period. Minimum guaranteed royalties are generally earned and received quarterly.
First Cost Segment. 
As of January 2023, the Company no longer serves as a buying agent for any of its customers, and as a result no longer reports under the First Cost segment. Prior to January 2023, the Company earned commissions for serving as a buying agent for footwear products under private labels and certain owned brands for select national chains, and value-priced retailers. As a buying agent, the Company utilized its expertise and relationships with shoe manufacturers to facilitate the production of private label shoes to customer specifications. The Company’s commission revenue also included fees charged for its design and product development services provided to certain suppliers. The Company satisfied its performance obligation to its customers by performing the services required in the buying agency agreements and thereby earning its commission fee at the point in time when the customer’s freight forwarder takes control of the goods.

STEVEN MADDEN, LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Variable Consideration
The Company provides markdown allowances and participates in co-op advertising programs to support retail sales of its products. These costs are deducted from gross sales to arrive at net sales in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.
Markdown Allowances. 
The Company provides markdown allowances to its retailer customers, which are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period in which the branded footwear and accessories/apparel revenues are recognized. The Company estimates its markdown allowances by reviewing several performance indicators, including retailers' inventory levels, sell-through rates, and gross margin levels.
Co-op Advertising Programs. 
Under co-op advertising programs, the Company agrees to reimburse the retailer for a portion of the costs incurred by the retailer to advertise and promote some of the Company's products. The Company estimates the costs of co-op advertising programs based on the terms of the agreements with its retailer customers.
Rights of Return. 
The Company’s Direct-to-Consumer segment accepts returns within 30 days from the date of sale (in-store) or delivery (online) for unworn merchandise that can be resold. Returns from wholesale customers are generally not accepted, except for the Company’s Blondo
®
 and Dolce Vita
®
 product lines. The Company estimates returns based on historical trends and current market conditions, which have historically not been material. In cases where wholesale customers return damaged products, the Company typically recovers costs from the responsible third-party factory. 
Taxes Collected from Customers
The Company accounts for certain taxes collected from its customers in accordance with the accounting guidance that allows for either gross presentation (included in revenue and costs) or net presentation (excluded from revenue). Taxes within the scope of this accounting guidance includes sales taxes, use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise taxes. The Company has elected the net presentation approach and excludes from revenue any taxes collected from customers.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales includes all expenses incurred to bring finished products to the Company’s distribution centers, customers’ freight forwarders, and, for the Direct-to-Consumer segment, to the Company’s stores (excluding depreciation and amortization). These costs include finished product costs, purchase commissions, letter of credit fees, brokerage fees, sample expenses, custom duties, inbound freight, royalty payments on licensed products, and labels and packaging. Warehouse and distribution costs related to the Wholesale segments, as well as freight costs to customers (if applicable), are recorded in operating expenses, rather than in cost of sales, in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company’s gross margins may not be directly comparable to those of other industry peers, as some companies classify warehouse, distribution, or other costs differently within their financial statements.
Warehouse and Shipping Costs
The Company includes warehouse and shipping costs in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
 For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, total warehouse and shipping costs were $
97,958
, $
97,100
, and $
111,326
, respectively. Since the Company's standard terms of sales are “FOB Steve Madden warehouse,” wholesale customers are typically responsible for any shipping costs. Shipping costs incurred by the Company for wholesale customers were not considered significant. Costs associated with shipping goods to customers are accounted for as fulfillment activities and reflected as operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Employee Benefit Plan
The Company maintains a tax-qualified 401(k) plan, which is available to each of the Company's eligible employees who elect to participate after meeting certain length-of-service and age requirements. The Company matches 
50
% of employees' contributions up to a maximum of 
6
% of eligible compensation, with vesting occurring over a specified period. 
F-12
STEVEN MADDEN, LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Total matching contributions for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were approximately $
2,658
, $
2,301
, and $
2,125
, respectively.
Derivative Instruments
The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to cash flow variability from foreign currency risk. Derivatives are recorded at fair value and included in prepaid expenses and other current assets or accrued expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company applies cash flow hedge accounting for its derivative instruments. Net gains and losses from these derivative instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to earnings in future periods when the related economic transactions impact earnings. Refer to Note 12 – Derivative Instruments for further information.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates applicable to taxable income for the periods in which these assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. 
The Company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on its technical merits. Recognized tax benefits are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Refer to Note 14 – Income Taxes for further information.
Equity-based Compensation
The Company recognizes compensation costs for equity-based awards when employees provide services in exchange for equity instruments. The Company’s equity-based compensation awards include the following:
Restricted stock awards
. 
Compensation costs for restricted stock awards is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. 
Stock options.
 Compensation costs for stock options is determined at the grant date, measured based on the fair value as calculated using the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) option-pricing model. The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions, including expected volatility, estimated option life, and interest rates.
Performance-based share awards.

The Company grants performance-based share awards to certain individuals, the vesting of which is contingent on the achievement of Company or individual performance goals. The Company estimates the probable outcome of the performance conditions, based on actual performance against these goals quarterly and adjusts the equity-based compensation expense accordingly. Shares are distributed upon completion of the service and performance periods. Compensation costs for performance-based awards is measured based on the closing fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.
The Company recognizes equity-based compensation costs net of estimated forfeitures. The Company estimates forfeiture rates based on historical data. Equity-based compensation costs is recognized over the award’s requisite service period and is included in operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 8 – Equity-Based Compensation for further information.
Leases
The Company leases office space, sample production space, warehouses, showrooms, storage units, and retail stores under operating leases. The Company’s portfolio of leases is primarily related to real estate. Since most of its leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on information available at lease commencement.
Some of the Company’s retail store leases provide for variable lease payments based on sales volumes at the leased locations. Because these variable lease payments cannot be measured at lease inception, they are excluded from the initial 
F-13
STEVEN MADDEN, LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
measurement of the ROU assets and lease liabilities and instead are expensed as incurred in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842, “Leases.”
Lease ROU assets and other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For stores with impairment indicators, the Company performs a recoverability test, comparing estimated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the related long-lived assets. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows, the assets are written down to fair value. Fair values of the long-lived assets are determined using an income approach, incorporating management’s cash flow projections and market rental rate estimates. Significant estimates are used in determining future cash flows of each store over its remaining lease term, including the Company's expectations of future projected cash flows. An impairment loss is recorded if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group exceeds its fair value. 
The Company's leases have initial terms ranging from 
1
 to 
12
 years and may have renewal or early termination options ranging from 
1
 to 
10
 years. A majority of the retail store leases provide for contingent rental payments if gross sales exceed certain targets. In addition, many of the leases contain rent escalation clauses to compensate for increases in operating costs and real estate taxes. Rent expense is calculated by amortizing total base rental payments (net of any rental abatements, construction allowances, and other rental concessions), on a straight-line basis, over the lease term. When renewal or termination options are deemed reasonably certain, they are included in the determination of the lease term and calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications were made to prior years' amounts to conform to the current years' presentation.
Note 3 – Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Adopted
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280)," which is intended to enhance the disclosures on reportable segments, including disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within segment profit and loss. ASU 2023-07 does not change how entities identify their operating segments, aggregates them, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine their reportable segments. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 for the year ended December 31, 2024, and applied it retrospectively to all prior periods presented. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements, but it did require increased disclosures within the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 19 – Operating Segment Information for further information.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

Note 4 – Acquisitions, Purchases and Sales of Joint Ventures, and Divestitures
Acquisitions

Almost Famous
In October 2023, Daniel M. Friedman & Associates, Inc. (“Buyer”), a New York corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities (the “Business”) of Turn On Products Inc. d/b/a Almost Famous (“Seller” or “Almost Famous”), pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, by and among Buyer, the Company, Seller, and the holders of capital stock of Seller. Almost Famous is a designer and marketer of women’s junior apparel. Almost Famous distributes its products to wholesale customers, including mass merchants, department stores, off-price retailers, and chain stores within the United States. Almost Famous markets products under its own brands, primarily Almost Famous, as well as private label brands for various retailers. This Business was acquired for cash consideration of $
73,228
 and a future payment contingent on the Almost Famous business achieving certain earnings before interest and tax ("EBIT") targets. In connection therewith, the Company recorded an initial short-term liability of $
3,325
 and a long-term liability of $
9,975
 as of the date of acquisition to reflect the estimated fair value of the contingent purchase price. The fair value of the contingent payments liability was estimated on the date of acquisition using the Monte Carlo simulation model, which included significant unobservable Level 3 inputs, such as projected EBIT over the earn-out period and a discount rate of 
20.3
%. Changes in these significant unobservable inputs might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The maximum consideration which can be paid over the consideration period of four years is $
68,000
 and there are no minimum payments required.

The liability will be remeasured at each reporting period with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. After the effect of closing adjustments, the total purchase price of the acquisition was $
86,528
.
The results of the Business have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition within the Wholesale Accessories/Apparel segment.

F-15
STEVEN MADDEN, LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The acquisition was accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 805, "Business Combinations," ("ASC 805"), which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values at the date of acquisition.
The Company recorded goodwill for the acquisition based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired, which consists largely of the synergies expected from the acquisitions. For tax purposes, goodwill will be amortized over a 
15
-year period. 
The fair value of the trademark was estimated using the relief-from-royalty method, which presumes the owner of the asset avoids hypothetical royalty payments that would need to be made for the use of the asset if the asset was not owned. Key assumptions and estimates used are forecasted revenue, a royalty rate of 
3.0
%, and a discount rate of 
21.8
%. Such assumptions included significant unobservable inputs and changes in these significant unobservable inputs might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The useful life of the trademark was estimated to be 20 years and amortization for the trademark has been recorded in operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company determined that the trademark was impaired and recognized an 
impairment charge
 of $
8,635
 for the remaining carrying value of the trademark. Refer to Note 7 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

for further information.
The fair value of the customer relationships was estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method. The excess earnings methodology is an income approach methodology that estimates the projected cash flows of the business attributable to the customer relationships, net of charges for the use of other identifiable assets of the business including working capital, fixed assets, and other intangible assets. Key assumptions and estimates used in deriving the projected cash flows are forecasted revenue, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA") margin of 
8.8
%, customer attrition rate of 
5.0
%, and discount rates in the range of 
21.0

23.5
%. Such assumptions include significant unobservable inputs and such changes in these significant unobservable inputs might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. The useful life of the customer relationships was estimated to be 20 years and amortization for these intangible assets has been recorded in operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Transaction costs of $
1,505
 for the year ended December 31, 2023 have been recorded within operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
ATM
In November 2024, the Company acquired the ATM Collection (“ATM”), an elevated basics apparel brand, for a total preliminary purchase price of $
9,783
, inclusive of customary closing price adjustments. 
The preliminary fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed included a trade name of $
6,300
, customer relationships of $
1,500
, accounts payable of $
1,870
, and inventories of $
1,658
. The Company recorded goodwill of $
2,195
 based on the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill recognized in the acquisition primarily reflects anticipated growth opportunities in both the wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels. For tax purposes, this goodwill will be amortized over 
15
 years. 
Since acquisition, the results of ATM have been included within the Wholesale Accessories/Apparel and Direct-to-Consumer segments.
Hosiery Business 
In March 2024 Daniel M. Friedman & Associates, Inc. acquired the Steve Madden and Betsey Johnson hosiery division ("hosiery business") of Gina Group LLC (“Gina”). Gina has been the exclusive licensee of the hosiery category for Steve Madden and Betsey Johnson brands and such license agreements were terminated in conjunction with the acquisition. The assets of the hosiery business were acquired for a cash consideration of $
4,259
 and the assets acquired included inventories of $
2,168
, reacquired rights of $
1,450
, and goodwill of $
641
.
The results of the hosiery business have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition within the Wholesale Accessories/Apparel segment. The Company determined that ATM and the hosiery business meets the definition of a business under ASC 805. Accordingly, the Company followed the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the total cost of an acquisition be allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values as of the acquisition date.

Divestitures
GREATS Business
In August 2024, the Company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities related to one of its subsidiaries, Greats Brand Inc. ("GREATS"), to an unrelated third party, Unified Commerce Group Ltd. ("UCG"), in exchange for a minority interest in UCG with an estimated fair value of approximately $
4,020
. This non-cash item is excluded from our Statement of Cash Flows. 
The Company determined that GREATS met the definition of a business under ASC 805. The transaction resulted in the deconsolidation of GREATS from the Company’s consolidated financial statements and the recognition of a loss on sale in the amount of $
3,199
, which was included within operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2024. The loss on sale included the carrying amounts of the net intangible assets of GREATS, which consisted of a trademark of $
4,287
 and customer relationships of $
861
. Additionally, goodwill decreased $
700
 related to the divestiture. Prior to the divestiture, GREATS was part of our Direct-to-Consumer segment. 
The Company retained a minority interest in UCG which does not give the Company significant influence over UCG. Consequently, the Company accounted for the investment under ASC 321, Investments – Equity Securities, and elected to apply the measurement alternative, which allows the Company to initially record the investment at cost and subsequently remeasure the investment at fair value upon observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer or impairment, if any. The investment was included within deposits and other on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2024.
Note 5 – Fair Value Measurements
The Company follows ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement” (“ASC 820”), which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It emphasizes that fair value should reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. ASC 820 also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in valuation methodologies. A brief description of the fair value hierarchy is as follows:
•
Level 1: 
Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•
Level 2: 
Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
•
Level 3:
 Significant unobservable inputs; inputs to the valuation methodology based on unobservable prices or valuation techniques that are significant to the fair value measurement.
The Company’s financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

 On December 31, 2024, the transfer out of Level 3 amount of $
8,547
, which was recorded in the Company's contingent consideration liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, represented the amount paid of our contingent liabilities which was measured based upon actual EBIT performance for the related performance period and was included as cash used in financing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of Almost Famous $
7,475
 and $
13,300
, respectively. The fair value was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which estimates the probability of various financial outcomes during the measurement period. The model utilized discount rates of 
17.5
% and 
20.3
% as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The change in fair value of the contingent payment liability reflects revisions to the forecasted operating results over the measurement period.
As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of ATM was $
90
 in connection with the November 2024 acquisition of ATM. The fair value was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, utilizing a discount rate of 
12.6
%. 
The fair values of goodwill and other intangibles are measured on a non-recurring basis and are determined using Level 3 inputs, including forecasted cash flows, discount rates, and implied royalty rates. Refer to Note 4 – Acquisitions, Purchases and Sales of Joint Ventures, and Divestitures and Note 7 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further information.
The fair values of lease right-of-use assets and fixed assets related to company-owned retail stores are measured on a non-recurring basis and are determined using Level 3 inputs, including estimated discounted future cash flows associated with the assets using sales trends, market rents, and market participant assumptions. Refer to Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.
The carrying value of certain financial instruments such as cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, factor accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximates their fair values due to the short-term nature of their underlying terms. Fair value of the notes receivable held by the Company approximates their carrying value based upon their imputed or actual interest rate, which approximates applicable current market interest rates. Some assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances (non-recurring). These assets can include long-lived assets that have been reduced to fair value when impaired. Assets that are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs.

Impairment of GREATS intangible assets
In the fourth quarter of 2023, certain circumstances occurred that indicated potential impairment and the Company performed a valuation of the GREATS
®
 trademark. The estimated fair value of this trademark was determined using an excess earnings method, incorporating the use of projected financial information and a discount rate of 
14.8
% which was developed using market participant-based assumptions. Changes in these significant unobservable inputs might result in a significantly 
F-21

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
higher or lower fair value measurement. As a result of this assessment, the GREATS
®
 trademark was written down from the carrying value of $
12,670
 to its fair value of $
6,150
, resulting in a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $
6,520
. This charge was recorded in impairment of intangibles in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and recognized in the Direct-to-Consumer segment. 
In the first quarter of 2024, circumstances occurred that caused a change in the estimated useful life of the GREATS
®
 trademark from an indefinite life to an estimated useful life of 
10
 years, and as a result, the Company performed an impairment test. The estimated fair value of this trademark was determined using an excess earnings method, incorporating the use of projected financial information and a discount rate of 
14.0
% which was developed using market participant-based assumptions. Changes in these significant unobservable inputs might result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. As a result of this assessment, the GREATS
®
 trademark was written down from the carrying value of $
6,150
 to its fair value of $
4,450
, resulting in a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $
1,700
, which was recorded in impairment of intangibles in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and recognized in the Direct-to-Consumer segment.
During the third quarter of 2024, the Company completed the sale of its GREATS business. As part of the divestiture, the remaining carrying amounts of the net intangible assets of GREATS, which included a trademark of $

Impairment of Almost Famous intangible assets
During the third quarter of 2024, the Company decided to discontinue the use of its Almost Famous brand and transition its marketing and sales efforts to the Madden Girl brand for the related product offerings. As a result of this decision, the Company reassessed the carrying amount of its Almost Famous trademark for impairment in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other. Based on this assessment, the Company determined that the estimated future cash flows related to the Almost Famous trademark was less than its carrying value, and therefore, the asset was impaired. As such, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $
8,635
, representing the remaining carrying amount of the asset, which was recorded within impairment of intangibles in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2024. The impairment charge was recognized in the Wholesale Apparel/Accessories segment.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted, which requires several assumptions. The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on the historical experience of similar awards. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. The dividend yield is based on the Company's annualized dividend per share amount divided by the Company's stock price. New shares are issued upon option exercise. 
The following weighted average assumptions were used for stock options granted during 2024, 2023, and 2022:

Performance-Based Awards
The Company issues performance-based awards to certain employees, the vesting of which is subject to the employee’s continuing employment and the Company's achievement of certain performance goals. In 2024, the Company issued 
86
 performance shares (at target), with a weighted average grant date fair value of $
41.63
, that are eligible to be earned over a 
three-year
 performance period from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, the Company estimated that the probable outcome of the performance conditions, based on performance through such date, was that the performance shares will be earned at 
185
% of the target level. The corresponding expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 is reflected in our stock-based compensation under performance-based awards.
As of December 31, 2024, $
4,861
 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share awards is expected to be recognized using the accelerated attribution method over a weighted-average period of 
2.0
 years.
In the year ended December 31, 2023, 
12
 performance shares vested at a weighted average exercise price of $
42.00
. 
No
 shares vested in the periods ended December 31, 2024 and 2022.

Note 9 – Preferred Stock
The Company has authorized 
5,000
 shares of preferred stock. The Board of Directors has designated 
60
 shares of such preferred stock as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred”). Holders of the shares of Series A Preferred are entitled to dividends equal to 
1
 times dividends declared or paid on the Company's common stock. Each share of Series A Preferred entitles the holder to 
1
 vote on all matters submitted to the holders of common stock. The Series A Preferred has a liquidation preference of $
1
 per share and is not redeemable by the Company. 
No
 shares of preferred stock have been issued.
Note 10 – Share Repurchase Program
The Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the “Share Repurchase Program”), effective as of January 1, 2004. The Share Repurchase Program does not have a fixed expiration or termination date and may be modified or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. On several occasions the Board of Directors has increased the amount authorized for repurchase of the Company's common stock. On May 8, 2023, the Board of Directors approved an increase in the Company's share repurchase authorization of approximately $
189,900
, bringing the total authorization to $
250,000
. The Share Repurchase Program permits the Company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases or in privately negotiated transactions at such prices and times as are determined to be in the best interest of the Company. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, an aggregate of 
2,090
 and 
3,127
, respectively, shares of the Company's common stock, excluding net settlements of employee stock awards, were repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program, at a weighted average price per share of $
43.15
 and $
34.89
, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $
90,153
 and $
109,118
, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $
85,310
 remained available for future repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program. 
The Steven Madden, Ltd. Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (as further amended, the "2006 Plan"), which expired on April 6, 2019, and the Steven Madden, Ltd. 2019 Incentive Compensation Plan, 
as amended
 (the "2019 Plan"), both provide the Company with the right to deduct or withhold, or require employees to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy any applicable tax withholding and/or option cost obligations applicable to stock-based compensation awards. To the extent permitted, employees may elect to satisfy all or part of such withholding obligations by tendering to the Company previously owned shares or by having the Company withhold shares having a fair market value equal to the employee's withholding tax obligation and/or option cost. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, an aggregate of 
211
 and 
2,002
 shares, respectively, were withheld in connection with the settlement of vested restricted stock to satisfy tax-withholding requirements and option costs, at an average price per share of $
42.84
 and $
36.75
, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $
9,058
 and $
73,591
, respectively.
Note 11 – Net Income Per Share of Common Stock
Basic net income per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, which does not include unvested restricted common stock subject to forfeiture of 
1,543
, 
1,290
, and 
2,109
 shares for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Diluted net income per share reflects: a) the potential dilution assuming shares of common stock were issued upon the exercise of outstanding in-the-money options and the assumed proceeds, which are deemed to be the proceeds from the exercise plus compensation cost not yet recognized attributable to 
F-25

future services using the treasury method, were used to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at the average market price during the period, b) the vesting of granted non-vested restricted stock awards for which the assumed proceeds upon vesting are deemed to be the amount of compensation cost not yet recognized attributable to future services using the treasury stock method, to the extent dilutive, and c) issued performance-based awards to the extent that the underlying performance conditions (i) have been satisfied as of the end of the reporting period or (ii) would be considered satisfied if the end of the reporting period were the end of the related contingency period and the result would be dilutive.

5
, 
39
, and 
46
, respectively, restricted shares, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share, as the result would have been anti-dilutive. The Company had contingently issuable performance-based awards outstanding that did not meet the performance conditions for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 and, therefore, were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per common share for those years. The maximum number of potentially dilutive shares that could be issued upon vesting for these performance-based awards were immaterial as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. These amounts were also excluded from the computation of weighted average potentially dilutive securities.
Note 12 – Derivative Instruments
The Company uses derivative instruments, specifically, forward foreign exchange contracts, to manage the risk associated with the volatility of future cash flows. The forward foreign exchange contracts are used to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on certain forecasted inventory purchases and are designated as cash flow hedges.

The Company applies the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.
The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods), projected future taxable income, and tax‑planning strategies in making this assessment. 
The Company’s decrease in valuation allowance of $
663
 is due to a decrease of net operating loss deferred tax assets in various foreign subsidiaries, which resulted in an aggregate valuation allowance of $
3,051
 for the year ended December 31, 2024.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits and interest and penalty expense was immaterial to the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. It is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits will decrease in the next twelve months. 
The Company’s consolidated financial statements provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated from foreign operations, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U.S. The deferred tax liability of $

 as of December 31, 2024 reflects the withholding tax on amounts that may be repatriated from foreign operations.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. for federal, state, and local purposes, and in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company's tax years 2021 through 2023 remain open to examination by most taxing authorities. 
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) was signed into law, which contains certain revisions to the Internal Revenue Code, including a 15% corporate minimum income tax for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. While the 15% corporate minimum income tax has no effect on the Company’s results of operations in the near term, the Company will continue to evaluate its impact on future years. The IRA also assesses a 1% excise tax on repurchases of corporate stock which impacts the Company’s stock repurchases effective January 1, 2023. The excise tax is recorded as an incremental cost in treasury stock on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and was $
752
 and $
765
 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) has implemented the global minimum tax rate of at least 15% for large multinational companies as of 2024 (“Pillar Two”). Under Pillar Two, a top-up tax will be required for any jurisdiction that has enacted Pillar Two and whose effective tax rate falls below the 15% global minimum rate. Additionally, the OECD issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax. Under the safe harbor, companies would be excluded from Pillar Two requirements provided certain criteria are met. Based on the Company’s analysis, the enactment of Pillar Two legislation does not have a material effect on the Company’s financial position. The Company will continue to monitor and reflect the impact of such legislative changes in future periods, as appropriate.

Note 16 – Credit Agreement
On July 22, 2020, the Company entered into a $
150,000
, secured revolving credit agreement (as amended to date, the “Credit Agreement”) with various lenders and Citizens Bank, as administrative agent (the “Agent”), which replaced the Company’s existing credit facility provided by Rosenthal & Rosenthal, Inc. (“Rosenthal”). The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) scheduled to mature on July 22, 2025. 
The initial $
150,000
 maximum availability under the Credit Facility is subject to a borrowing base calculation consisting of certain eligible accounts receivable, credit card receivables, inventory, and in-transit inventory. Availability under the Credit Facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit. The Company may from time-to-time increase the maximum availability under the Credit Agreement by up to $
100,000
 if certain conditions are satisfied. 
On March 25, 2022, an amendment to the Credit Agreement (the “Amendment”) replaced the London Interbank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”) with the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (“BSBY”) as the interest rate benchmark. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement generally bear interest at a variable rate equal to a specified margin, which is based upon the average availability under the Credit Facility from time to time, plus, at the Company’s election, (i) BSBY for the applicable interest period or (ii) the base rate (which is the highest of (a) the prime rate announced by the Agent, (b) the sum of the federal funds effective rate plus 
0.50
%, and (c) the sum of the one-month BSBY rate plus 
1.00
%). Furthermore, the Amendment reduced the specified margin used to determine the interest rate under the Credit Agreement and reduced the commitment fee paid by the Company to the Agent, for the account of each lender. Additionally, the Amendment reduced the frequency of the Company’s borrowing base reporting requirements when no loans are outstanding. The Amendment also extended the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to March 20, 2027. As amended on April 3, 2023, on October 23, 2023, the Credit Agreement was further amended to accommodate changes made to the Company’s factoring arrangement with CIT pursuant to the Notification Factoring Rider as described in Note 17 – Factoring Agreements.
Under the Credit Agreement, the Company must also pay (i) a commitment fee to the Agent, for the account of each lender, which accrues at a rate equal to 
0.25
% per annum on the average daily unused amount of the commitment of such lender, (ii) a letter of credit participation fee to the Agent, for the account of each lender, ranging from 
1.25
% to 
2.50
% per annum, based upon average availability under the Credit Facility from time to time, multiplied by the average daily amount 
F-32
STEVEN MADDEN, LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
available to be drawn under the applicable letter of credit, and (iii) a letter of credit fronting fee to each issuer of a letter of credit under the Credit Agreement, which will accrue at a rate per annum separately agreed upon between the Company and such issuer.
The Credit Agreement contains various restrictions and covenants applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries. Among other requirements, availability under the Credit Facility must, at all times, (i) prior to the occurrence of the permanent borrowing base trigger (as defined in the Credit Agreement), equal or exceed the greater of $
22,500
 and 
15
% of the line cap (as defined in the Credit Agreement), and (ii) after the occurrence of the permanent borrowing base trigger, equal or exceed the greater of $
15,000
 and 
10
% of the line cap (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Other than this minimum availability requirement, the Credit Agreement does not include any financial maintenance covenants.
The Credit Agreement requires the Company and various subsidiaries of the Company to guarantee each other’s obligations arising from time to time under the Credit Facility, as well as obligations arising in respect of certain cash management and hedging transactions. Subject to customary exceptions and limitations, all borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by a lien on all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and each subsidiary guarantor.
The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. If an event of default under the Credit Agreement occurs and is continuing, then the Agent may, and at the request of the required lenders shall, terminate the loan commitments under the Credit Agreement, declare any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable, or require the Company to adequately cash collateralize outstanding letter of credit obligations. If the Company or, with certain exceptions, a subsidiary becomes the subject of a proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar law, then the loan commitments under the Credit Agreement will automatically terminate, and any outstanding obligations under the Credit Agreement and the cash collateral required under the Credit Agreement for any outstanding letter of credit obligations will become immediately due and payable.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
no
 cash borrowings and 
no
 letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
Note 17 – Factoring Agreements
In conjunction with the Credit Agreement described in Note 16 – Credit Agreement, on July 22, 2020, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Madden Entities”) entered into an Amended and Restated Deferred Purchase Factoring Agreement (the “Factoring Agreement”) with Rosenthal & Rosenthal, Inc. ("Rosenthal"). Pursuant to the Factoring Agreement, Rosenthal serves as the collection agent with respect to certain receivables of the Madden Entities and is entitled to receive a base commission of 
0.20
% of the gross invoice amount of each receivable assigned for collection, plus certain additional fees and expenses, subject to certain minimum annual commissions. Rosenthal will generally assume the credit risk resulting from a customer’s financial inability to make payment of credit-approved receivables, which are classified as Factor Receivables. The initial term of the Factoring Agreement is twelve months, subject to automatic renewal for additional twelve-month periods, and the Factoring Agreement may be terminated at any time by Rosenthal or the Madden Entities on 60 days' notice and upon the occurrence of certain other events. The Madden Entities pledged all of their rights under the Factoring Agreement to the Agent under the Credit Agreement to secure obligations arising under the Credit Agreement.
On April 3, 2023, in conjunction with a related amendment to the Credit Agreement, the Madden Entities also entered into a Credit Approved Receivables Purchasing Agreement (the “CARPA”) with CIT Group/Commercial Services, Inc. (“CIT”). Pursuant to the CARPA, in addition to Rosenthal, CIT will serve as a non-exclusive collection agent with respect to certain of the Madden Entities’ receivables and will generally assume the credit risk resulting from a customer’s financial inability to make payment with respect to credit approved receivables. Additionally, CIT shall compensate the Madden Entities for 
50
% of the losses sustained for limiting or revoking a credit line during production for any made-to-order goods that have work-in-progress coverage. For its services, CIT will be entitled to receive (1) a base fee of 
0.15
% of the gross face amount of each receivable assigned for collection having standard payment terms, (2) certain additional fees for receivables with non-standard payment terms or arising from sales to customers outside of the United States, and (3) reimbursement for certain expenses incurred in connection with the CARPA. The Company, on behalf of the Madden Entities, and CIT may each terminate the CARPA as of the last day of the month occurring one year after the date of the CARPA and at any time thereafter by giving the other party at least 
60
 days’ notice. CIT may also terminate the CARPA immediately upon the occurrence of certain events. The Madden Entities pledged all of their right, title, and interest in and to monies due and to become due under the CARPA in favor of the Agent to secure obligations arising under or in connection with the Credit Agreement.
F-33
STEVEN MADDEN, LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
On October 23, 2023, the Company and Daniel M. Friedman & Associates, Inc. (“DMFA”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a Notification Factoring Rider to the Credit Approved Receivables Purchasing Agreement (“Notification Factoring Rider”) that amended and supplemented the Factoring Agreement, dated April 3, 2023, among the Company, DMFA and certain of the Company’s other subsidiaries party thereto (collectively with the Company, the “Madden Entities”), and added CIT. The Notification Factoring Rider enables certain receivables generated from assets acquired by DMFA from Turn On Products Inc. d/b/a Almost Famous (“Post-Acquisition Receivables”), which assets were acquired by DMFA on October 20, 2023, to be subject to the Factoring Agreement.
The Notification Factoring Rider modifies the Factoring Agreement to require, in respect of certain Post-Acquisition Receivables, payment to CIT of a base fee ranging from 
0.10
% to 
0.20
% of the gross face amount of such Post-Acquisition Receivables assigned to CIT for collection. CIT will generally assume the credit risk resulting from a customer’s financial inability to make payment with respect to certain credit approved Post-Acquisition Receivables. The Company or DMFA may terminate the Notification Factoring Rider, separately from the Factoring Agreement, by giving CIT at least 10 days’ prior written notice of termination. As with monies due and to become due under the Factoring Agreement generally, monies due and to become due to the Company and DMFA under the Notification Factoring Rider are pledged in favor of the Agent to secure obligations under or in connection with the Credit Agreement.
Note 18 – Note Receivable – Related Party
On June 25, 2007, the Company made a loan to Steven Madden, its Founder and Creative and Design Chief and a principal stockholder of the Company, in the amount of $
3,000
 in order for Mr. Madden to satisfy a personal tax obligation resulting from the exercise of stock options that were due to expire and to retain the underlying Company common stock. The loan, as amended, was secured by non-company securities held in Mr. Madden's brokerage account. The Company agreed to forgive a portion of the note for each year of employment as long as Mr. Madden remained an employee of the Company through December 31, 2023. Accordingly, as of such date, the remaining balance of the note was forgiven by the Company, 
no
 amounts remained outstanding, and neither the Company nor Mr. Madden have any outstanding obligations under the note. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 the Company recorded a charge in the amount of $
409
 for each year, respectively, to write-off the required one-tenth of the principal amount of the secured promissory note, which was partially offset by imputed interest income of $
8
 and $
16
, respectively.
Note 19 – Operating Segment Information
The Company has determined its reportable operating segments based on the internal management structure used by the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (or “CODM”), who is its Chief Executive Officer, to evaluate performance and allocate resources. This structure organizes the business into distinct categories based on product types and sales channels. The Company’s reportable operating segments consist of the following:
•
Wholesale Footwear.

This segment designs, sources, and markets our brands and sells our products to department stores, mass merchants, off-price retailers, shoe chains, online retailers, national chains, specialty retailers, independent stores, and clubs throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Europe, and through our joint ventures and international distributor network. 
•
Wholesale Accessories/Apparel.

This segment designs, sources, and markets our brands and sells our products, primarily consisting of handbags and apparel, to department stores, mass merchants, off-price retailers, online retailers, specialty retailers, independent stores, and clubs throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Europe, and through our joint ventures and international distributor network.
•
Direct-to-Consumer. 
This segment engages in the sale of footwear, handbags, apparel, and other accessories through Steve Madden and Dolce Vita full-price retail stores, Steve Madden outlet stores, directly-operated concessions in international markets, and directly-operated e-commerce websites. We operate retail locations in regional malls and shopping centers, as well as high streets in various cities across the United States, Canada, Mexico, and other international markets through our joint ventures.
•
Licensing.

This segment engages in the licensing of the Steve Madden and Betsey Johnson
®
 trademarks for use in the sale of select apparel, accessories, and home categories as well as various other non-core products.
As of January 2023, the Company no longer serves as a buying agent for any of its customers, and as a result no longer reports under the First Cost segment. This change is not considered to have a material or meaningful impact on the Company's operations. 
F-34
STEVEN MADDEN, LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
In addition, the Company has certain corporate-related costs (“Corporate costs” or “Corporate”) that are not directly attributable to its reportable operating segments. Accordingly, these corporate-related costs do not constitute a reportable segment. These costs are primarily associated with corporate executives, corporate finance, corporate social responsibility, legal, human resources, information technology, cybersecurity, and other shared services.
The Company’s CODM evaluates financial performance based primarily on gross profit and income from operations for each reportable operating segment. Gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of goods sold. Income from operations is defined as profit or loss from operations before interest and other income, net and income taxes. Gross profit is a key measure for assessing the efficiency of the segment in producing its products or services, focusing on the direct costs associated with production. Income from operations is a key measure for understanding the overall financial performance of each segment, taking into account both direct operational costs and indirect expenses. These measures are used together to evaluate segment performance and determine the appropriate allocation of resources to each segment.
The Company’s CODM does not evaluate the financial performance of each segment based on its respective assets or capital expenditures, and therefore, the Company does not report this information.

STEVEN MADDEN, LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 21 – Subsequent Events
Entry into a Definitive Purchase Agreement
On February 12, 2025 (the “Effective Date”), Steve Madden entered into a sale and purchase deed (the “Purchase Agreement”), by and among SML UK Holding Ltd., an English limited company and indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Steve Madden (the “Purchaser”), various entities comprising the Fifth Cinven Fund (the “Cinven Sellers”), Bain & Company, Inc. (“Bain”), Squam Lake Investors X LP (BGPI) (“Squam Lake”), and together with the Cinven Sellers and Bain, (the “Institutional Sellers”), certain individuals (the “Individual Sellers”), and together with the Institutional Sellers, (the “Sellers”), and Steve Madden, as guarantor, pursuant to which the Purchaser has agreed to acquire the entire issued share capital of Mercury Acquisitions Topco Limited, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of Jersey and the holding company for the Kurt Geiger business (the “Target”), as further described below (the “Transaction”).
On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser has agreed to purchase all of the shares of Target at a base purchase price of approximately £
202,000
 (the “Base Purchase Price”), subject to certain adjustments, including a "locked box" mechanism. Pursuant to such mechanism, (i) the Base Purchase Price will be increased at a rate of £
42
 per day for the period from February 3, 2024 (the "Locked Box Date") to and including the closing date of the Transaction (the "Closing Date"), and (ii) the Base Purchase Price will be reduced on a pound-for-pound basis for certain value items, as more specifically set forth in the Purchase Agreement. In addition, the loan notes outstanding from Mercury Midco 1 Limited, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Target ("Midco 1"), which are payable to certain Sellers, will be redeemed, and the Base Purchase Price will be reduced in an amount equal to the aggregate total redemption amount. 
The closing of the Transaction is subject to certain closing conditions. The Purchaser, the Sellers, and the Target have agreed to cooperate in good faith and use their reasonable best efforts, subject to limitations, to procure that these conditions are fulfilled. The Purchase Agreement will automatically terminate if any closing condition has not been fulfilled or waived by December 5, 2025. 
In connection with the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser has also entered into a management warranty deed (the “Management Warranty Deed”), pursuant to which certain members of management of the Target have provided certain additional customary representations and warranties related to the Target’s business. The Purchaser has separately obtained a warranty and indemnity insurance policy, effective as of the date of entry into the Purchase Agreement and the Management Warranty Deed, which contains customary coverage and exceptions.
Entry into a Commitment Letter
In connection with and concurrently with the entry into, the Purchase Agreement, Steve Madden entered into a commitment letter, dated February 12, 2025 (the “Commitment Letter”), with Citizens Bank, JPMorgan Chase Bank, and Citibank (collectively, the “Commitment Parties”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Commitment Parties have committed to provide debt financing for the Transaction, consisting of senior secured credit facilities of up to an aggregate total of $
550,000
, which includes a $
300,000
 term loan and a $
250,000
 revolving credit facility, on the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter. The obligations of the Commitment Parties to provide debt financing under the Commitment Letter are subject to a number of customary conditions including, without limitation, execution and delivery of definitive documentation consistent with the Commitment Letter.
