We operate retail locations in regional malls and shopping centers, as well as high streets in various cities across the United States, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, the Middle East, Israel, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region. Our stores play an important role in our test-and-react strategy, and also serve as fulfillment and return locations for our e-commerce business. Our stores also serve as a marketing tool that allows us to strengthen global brand recognition and to showcase selected items from our full line of branded and licensed products.

3
that our retail stores and websites enhance overall sales and profitability and our ability to react quickly to changing consumer demands.

PRODUCT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
We have established a reputation for our creative design, marketing, and trend-right products at affordable price points. Our future success will substantially depend on our ability to continue to anticipate and react quickly to changing consumer demands. To meet this objective, we have developed what we believe is an unparalleled design team and process. Our design team strives to create designs that are true to our DNA, reflect current or anticipated trends, and can be manufactured in a timely and cost-effective manner. Most new products are tested in select retail stores and on our e-commerce websites. Based on these tests, among other things, products are selected and then offered for wholesale and direct-to-consumer distribution worldwide. We believe that our design and testing processes combined with our flexible sourcing model provide our brands with a significant competitive advantage and allow us to reduce the risk of incurring significant exit costs associated with the production and distribution of less desirable designs.
MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY CHAIN
We source each of our product lines separately based on the individual design, style, and quality specifications of our various brands and product categories. We do not own or operate any foreign manufacturing facilities; rather, we use agents and our own sourcing offices to source our products from independently owned manufacturers in China, Cambodia, Mexico, Vietnam, Brazil, India, Italy, and various other countries. We have established relationships with a number of manufacturers and agents in each of these countries. We have not entered into any long-term manufacturing or supply contracts. We believe that a sufficient number of alternative sources exist for the manufacture of our products.
We continually monitor the availability of the principal raw materials used in our footwear, accessories, and apparel which are currently available from a number of sources in various parts of the world. We track inventory flow on a regular basis, monitor sell-through data, and incorporate input on product demand from our customers.
The suppliers and manufacturers of our products are required to adopt our Supplier Code of Conduct 2.0, which specifies that they comply with all local laws and regulations governing human rights, working conditions, anti-corruption, restricted substances, and environmental compliance, including animal welfare and conflict minerals, before we conduct business with them. We are committed to working with manufacturers, suppliers, vendors, and agents that share our Company’s goal of maintaining socially responsible and sustainable business practices.
Our products are manufactured overseas and most of our products are shipped via ocean freight carriers to our third-party distribution facilities in California and to a lesser extent New Jersey, and via ground freight from Mexico to our third-party distribution facility in Texas. We rely to a lesser extent on air carriers for the shipping of products. Once our products arrive in the United States, we distribute them mainly from six third-party distribution centers, including four located in California, one located in Texas, and one located in New Jersey. Our products are also distributed through a Company-operated distribution center located in Canada and through our third-party distribution facilities in Mexico and Europe. By utilizing distribution facilities specializing in fulfillment for wholesale customers, retail stores and e-commerce businesses, we believe that our customers are served in a prompt and efficient manner. Suppliers of products for our businesses in Canada, Mexico, Europe, China and our joint ventures in South Africa, the Middle East, Israel, various countries in Europe, Latin America, and certain countries in Asia, ship directly to the respective countries. Products for our overseas distributors are shipped to freight forwarders primarily in China, Cambodia, and Mexico where the distributor arranges for subsequent shipment. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” below for a discussion of the risks associated with supply chain disruptions and changes to international trade policies.

DISTRIBUTION
For the year ended December 31, 2024, our revenue was primarily generated through two distribution channels: Wholesale and Direct-to-Consumer. Wholesale accounted for approximately $1,722,113, or 75.4% of total revenue, while Direct-to-Consumer accounted for approximately $550,153, or 24.1% of total revenue. Each distribution channel is described below.
Wholesale. 
We distribute product within our Wholesale Footwear and Wholesale Accessories/Apparel segments through a broad network of over 2,000 retailers, including department stores, mass merchants, off-price retailers, shoe chains, online retailers, national chains, specialty retailers, independent stores, and club stores. Our wholesale distribution network spans across the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Europe, as well as various international markets through our joint ventures. We also distribute our product under various distribution agreements in certain international markets. Under the terms of our distribution agreements, the distributors purchase product from us and are generally required to open a minimum number of stores each year and maintain a certain minimum level of sales in the licensed territory. The distribution agreements currently in place expire on various dates and include renewal options provided certain conditions are met.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, our top ten wholesale channel customers, in no particular order, included: Nordstrom, Macy's, Dillard's, Designer Brands, The TJX Companies, Ross Stores, Burlington Stores, Amazon, Walmart, and Target. In 2024, the Company had one customer who accounted for more than 10% of total revenue. That customer accounted for 11.8% of total revenue.
As of December 31, 2024, there were three customers who each accounted for more than 10% of total accounts receivable. These three customers accounted for 22.3%, 16.3%, and 14.4%, respectively, of total accounts receivable. 
Direct-to-Consumer. 
We distribute product within our Direct-to-Consumer segment through Steve Madden and Dolce Vita full-price retail stores, Steve Madden outlet stores, directly-operated concessions in international markets, and directly-operated e-commerce websites. We operate retail locations in regional malls, shopping centers, and high streets in various cities across the United States, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, the Middle East, Israel, Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region. We also operate concessions in South Africa, Taiwan, and Canada.
As of December 31, 2024, we operated 291 brick-and-mortar retail stores, including five Dolce Vita full-price stores and 68 Steve Madden outlet stores, and five e-commerce websites. In addition, we operated 42 Steve Madden concessions in international markets. Out of the 291 total brick-and-mortar retail stores, 178 stores were located outside of the United States.
COMPETITION
The fashion industry is highly competitive, with numerous domestic and international companies operating in the footwear, apparel, and accessories markets. Our competitors may have greater financial, operational, and marketing resources, among other advantages, which may allow them to compete more effectively. We believe that brand strength, trend-driven styling, product quality, value proposition, speed-to-market, marketing and distribution,

and customer relationships are the key factors driving success in our industry. We remain committed to leveraging these elements to maintain and grow our market position. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against both established and emerging competitors. Increased competition, shifting consumer preferences, and evolving market dynamics could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For further discussion of related risks, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
MARKETING
We have focused on creating a full-funnel marketing strategy that covers all stages of the customer journey to establish our Company as a leading designer and marketer of fashion footwear, accessories, and apparel for a diverse set of style-conscious consumers. Principal marketing activities include brand and performance marketing, social media and influencer marketing, experiential events, in-store and online promotions, and public relations focusing on product and brand placements, celebrity seeding, as well as public and media appearances by our Founder and Creative and Design Chief, Steve Madden. We foster high value lifetime customer relationships with investments in marketing technology and talent, both in-house and via strategic partnerships with external agencies. We continue to promote our e-commerce websites where customers can purchase Steve Madden, Dolce Vita

, Betsey Johnson
®
, Blondo

and ATM

 products.

MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (MIS) OPERATIONS
Effective and sophisticated information systems are essential to maintaining our competitive position and supporting our growth strategy. Our technology infrastructure consists of several integrated systems, as described below, designed to manage key business functions across wholesale, retail, e-commerce, and logistics. 
•
Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) System.

Our ERP system is an integrated system that supports our wholesale operations in the areas of finance and accounting, sourcing, purchase order management, customer order management, and inventory control. All of our North American wholesale businesses (other than Canada and Almost Famous, which are each operating under separate ERP systems), our European business, as well as our Asia sourcing operations, are operated through this ERP system.
•
Warehouse Management System ("WMS").

Our WMS is utilized by the majority of our third-party logistics providers and is fully integrated with our ERP system to streamline inventory distribution processes. 
•
Retail and Point-of-Sale ("POS") Systems.

Our retail stores operate on various POS systems that are integrated with our retail inventory management and store replenishment system to optimize in-store operations. 
•
E-commerce Platform.

We utilize a direct-to-consumer e-commerce platform that supports our online sales, enabling customers to purchase products through our branded websites. This platform integrates with our ERP system and WMS to manage inventory, process sales, and coordinate fulfillment. We utilize a reputable cloud-based solution to support our growing e-commerce business. 
•
Ancillary Systems and Third-Party Services.

Supporting our core systems, we utilize various specialized tools for supply chain management, business intelligence, data warehousing, Electronic Data Interchange, credit card processing, human resources, and payroll.

We regularly update and enhance these systems to improve functionality, efficiency, and integration across our business.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS
The Company maintains its information technology and security policies, comprised of risk management policies and procedures surrounding the Company’s information systems, cybersecurity practices, and protection of confidential information. The Company’s Chief Information Security Officer has ultimate oversight of the Company’s cyber risk management policies and procedures, and chairs quarterly Information Security Steering Committee meetings, which provide cooperation, collaboration, and consensus driven information security guidance to both the Information Technology Department, and the Company as a whole. Our Chief Information Security Officer oversees our cybersecurity risk management and information security programs and provides quarterly status reports to the Information Security Steering Committee and the Audit Committee. As part of the Company's information security program, all global employees are required to complete annual training on information security awareness, including cybersecurity, global data privacy requirements, and information technology compliance measures. Certain roles require additional role-based, specialized cybersecurity training, such as tabletop exercises to ensure proactive preparation and effective coordination in the event of a security incident. The Company continuously performs penetration testing internally for all internal and public facing assets and annual network and application penetration tests are also conducted by a reputable external vendor. The outcomes and findings of the penetration testing are shared with the Information Security Steering Committee and the Audit Committee, as well as any steps the Company has taken to mitigate and remediate any identified risks. Additionally, we maintain network security and cyber liability insurance in order to provide a level of financial protection in the event of certain covered cyber losses and data breaches.
TRADEMARKS
Our strategy for the continued growth of our business includes expanding our presence beyond footwear, accessories, and apparel through the selective licensing of our brands. We consider our company-owned trademarks to be among our most valuable assets, and have registered many of our trademarks in the United States and 149 other countries and in numerous International Classes. From time to time, we adopt new trademarks and new logos and/or stylized versions of our trademarks in connection with the marketing of new product lines. We believe that these trademarks have significant value and are important for purposes of identifying our Company, the marketing of our products and the products of our licensees, and distinguishing them from the products of others. 
Trademarks we believe to be most significant to our business include: Steve Madden
®
, Madden Girl
®
, Madden NYC
®
, Betsey Johnson
®
, Dolce Vita
®
, Blondo
®
, and ATM
®
. We license our Steve Madden
®
 and the Betsey Johnson
®
 trademark for use in connection with the manufacture, marketing, and sale of select apparel, accessories, and home categories as well as various other non-core products.
7
In addition to the licensing of our trademarks, we in-license the trademarks of third parties for use in connection with some of our product lines. Generally, these licensing arrangements require us to make royalty payments equal to a percentage of our revenue or a minimum royalty as well as maintain a certain level of marketing to support the licensed trademark.
For additional information on our licensing arrangements, refer to Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 15 – Commitments, Contingencies, and Other in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
As of February 1, 2025, we employed approximately 4,800 employees globally, with approximately 2,200 of these employees located in the United States and 2,600 located internationally. Of these employees, approximately 3,500 work full-time and approximately 1,300 work part-time. Most of our part-time employees work in the Direct-to-Consumer segment. None of our employees are represented by a union, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. We have never experienced a material interruption of our operations due to a labor dispute. 
Culture
Steve Madden is for the bold, expressive, and ambitious. Our guiding principles are key to our competitive edge and are embedded throughout all levels of our Company. They motivate our growth, inspire our innovation, define our culture, and set the standard for all of our actions. 
•
First things first. 
Take care of the fundamentals before anything else.
•
It starts with trust.

Great teams are built upon trust. We build trust through honesty, care for the greater good, and follow-through.
•
Don’t coast
.
 Celebrate success, but don’t rest on your laurels. Hustle and grind are what set us apart.
•
Think big and small.

Have your eyes on the big picture while obsessing over the details.
•
The customer is our muse.

Study our customers, connect with them directly, and always be open to inspiration.
•
Place team ownership over personal ego.

The company wins when the team has ownership. Don’t let your ego control you.
•
Everyone can be creative.
 Creativity is about more than making art. It’s about seeing around corners, working within limitations, and being original.
•
Progress, not perfection. 
Act upon good ideas quickly and always be ready to iterate.
Career Development
In the dynamic world of fashion, it is vital that we support the continuous learning and personal growth of our employees. Our talent development initiatives focus on enhancing internal programs and processes that empower our employees to excel and feel a strong sense of belonging and fulfillment in their roles. Key initiatives include our long-standing professional development relationship with the University of Arizona Global Campus, a comprehensive tuition reimbursement program, leadership and management training, and access to external conferences and workshops that focus on specific industry knowledge. Further, we offer SM Learning Sessions, a company-wide initiative that brings together internal and external experts to share knowledge on diverse topics. This program not only enhances skillsets, but also fosters a collaborative and inclusive environment, encouraging cross-departmental interaction and networking. Furthermore, performance evaluations and constructive feedback mechanisms are integral to our strategy. By investing in employee development, we aim to create a workplace where employees are not only equipped to meet the challenges of the ever-evolving fashion industry but are also deeply engaged and committed to our long-term success.
Employee Wellness
At Steve Madden, we prioritize the well-being of our employees, which is why we’ve established Wellness Wednesdays as a monthly opportunity for our team to invest in themselves. During these sessions, employees can take a break from their work routines to indulge in rejuvenating activities like meditation sessions, soothing back massages, and nutritious snacks. Additionally, we offer financial wellness seminars, health fairs, discounted gym memberships, and on-site discounted food. We also offer an employee assistance program with a range of programs, resources, and tools that can help with various wellness issues. We collaborate with featured vendors to enhance the experience and provide even more ways for our employees to prioritize their wellness.

Charitable Giving
The Company regularly makes charitable donations, primarily through The Steve Madden Corporate Foundation (the “Foundation”), a donor-advised fund established under Fidelity Charitable and managed by Rockefeller Capital Management. The Foundation's charitable giving priorities include: 
•
Industry Innovation:

We support equity, sustainability, and accessibility in the fashion industry. Our goal is to empower industry leaders and emerging talents to create a more equitable and sustainable future through strategic projects and collaborations that align with our commitment to progressive change. 
•
Community Impact:

We uplift the communities surrounding our offices, stores, and supply chain. Through local partnerships and targeted donations, we address the specific needs of the areas where we operate, fostering stronger, more resilient communities. 
We contributed $1.3 million and $1.0 million to the Foundation during 2024 and 2023, respectively, and have since launched multiple shop-to-give campaigns across our various company-operated e-commerce websites. Further information on our charitable initiatives can be found on the "Sustainability" section of our website, https://www.stevemadden.com/.
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS
Our business is subject to various United States federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to environmental protection, health, and safety. We may also incur liability under environmental laws and regulations for contamination at sites we currently or previously owned or operated, including contamination caused by prior owners, operators, neighboring properties, or other third parties. Additionally, we may be responsible for the off-site disposal of hazardous materials. We believe we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. To date, compliance requirements have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings, or competitive position. For further discussion of related risks, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
SEASONALITY AND OTHER FACTORS
Our operating results are influenced by seasonality and other factors that create variability from quarter to quarter. For example, boot sales typically peak in the fall and winter months (third and fourth fiscal quarters), while sandal sales are strongest in the spring and summer months (first and second fiscal quarters). Additionally, our Direct-to-Consumer segment experiences heightened demand during the holiday retail season. Our diverse product portfolio, however, helps to mitigate the impact of seasonal fluctuations in any single product category. 
Beyond seasonality, several other factors contribute to quarterly fluctuations in our operating results, including weather conditions, timing of holidays and bulk footwear shipments, market acceptance of our products, pricing, product presentation and promotional strategies, our ability to deliver on-trend styles at the right time, fluctuations in personnel needs and operational costs, inventory management, including potential write-downs for obsolescence, fluctuations in material costs and product mix across our wholesale, direct-to-consumer and licensing businesses, and external conditions, such as general macroeconomic trends, consumer confidence and competitor actions. 
Additionally, the amount of revenue recognized in any period may be impacted by shifts in consumer demand or purchasing behavior. Customers may also cancel orders, modify delivery schedules, or alter product mixes with minimal notice, adding further unpredictability to our financial results.
While we actively manage these variables, there is no assurance that we will not be materially impacted by seasonal trends or other external factors. For further discussion of related risks, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
BACKLOG
We had unfilled wholesale customer orders of approximately $609,453 and $533,609, as of February 3, 2025 and February 3, 2024, respectively. Our backlog at any given time is influenced by factors, including seasonality, supply chain lead times, timing of market weeks, and wholesale customer purchases of core products through our open stock program. Due to these variables, period-to-period comparisons of backlog may not be indicative of future revenue or shipment trends.
