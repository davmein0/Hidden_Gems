In addition to the above properties, the Company occupies 291 leased full price and outlet brick-and-mortar locations. These leases expire at various times through fiscal year 2035. Substantially all of our retail stores are leased pursuant to leases that, under their original terms, extend for an average of five years. Many of the leases contain rent escalation clauses to compensate for increases in operating costs and real estate taxes over the base year.
