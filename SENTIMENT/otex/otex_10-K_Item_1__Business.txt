On January 31, 2023, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding ordinary shares of Micro Focus International Limited, formerly Micro Focus International plc (Micro Focus), a leading provider of mission-critical software technology and services that help customers accelerate digital transformation, for a total purchase price of $6.2 billion (the Micro Focus Acquisition), inclusive of Micro Focus’ cash and repayment of Micro Focus’ outstanding indebtedness.
On May 1, 2024, we completed the divestiture of our Application Modernization and Connectivity (AMC) business to Rocket Software, Inc. (Rocket Software) for $2.275 billion in cash before taxes, fees and other adjustments (the AMC Divestiture). During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, working capital and other adjustments were finalized, which resulted in a payment of $11.7 million to Rocket Software, and a decrease to the gain on the AMC Divestiture by $4.2 million. We used the net proceeds from the AMC Divestiture to complete a $2.0 billion debt reduction, which resulted in the termination of the Term Loan B (as defined below) and the reduction of amounts outstanding under the Acquisition Term Loan (as defined below).

Our Strategy
We believe our strategic priorities position us well to create both near and long-term shareholder value through organic and inorganic growth, greater capital efficiency and improved profitability. As an organization, we are focused on our three strategic priorities:
•
Expanding our competitive advantage
We believe we are well positioned in our key markets to increase our competitive AI-first advantage through our product cycle and leading with Business AI, Business Clouds and Business Security. This includes: 
Invest in Innovation
. We believe we are well-positioned to develop additional innovative solutions to address the evolving market. We plan to continue investing in technology innovation by funding internal development, acquiring complementary technologies and collaborating with third parties.
Invest in Technology Leadership
. We believe we are well-positioned to develop additional innovative solutions to address the evolving market. We plan to continue investing in technology innovation by funding internal development, acquiring complementary technologies and collaborating with third-parties.
Invest in Business AI
. With the lens of driving an AI-first strategy, we believe that customers are seeking practical AI and OpenText is in a strong position to help customers discover the most prevailing use cases that leverage an interconnected source of all data types (including content, business network, customer experience, IT service management, application development, asset management, and IoT). We believe one of the greatest opportunities is to help customers leverage their operational and experience data with 
10
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
generative AI to discover search and summarize the data easily and to automate work to gain competitive advantages. We strive to co-innovate with customers by taking the proven concept of machine learning and applying it to their organizational needs.
Invest in the Business Clouds
. Today, the destination for innovation is the cloud. Businesses of all sizes rely on a combination of APIs, public and private clouds, managed services and off-cloud solutions. As a result, we are committed to continue to modernize our technology infrastructure and leverage existing investments in the OpenText Cloud. The combination of OpenText cloud-native applications and managed services, together with the scalability and performance of our partner public cloud providers, offer more secure, reliable and compliant solutions to customers wanting to deploy cloud-based Information Management applications. OpenText Cloud Editions is designed to build additional flexibility and scalability for our customers: becoming cloud-native, connecting anything and extending capabilities quickly with multi-tenant “software as a service” (SaaS) applications and services. 
Invest in Business Technology
. Customers need the ability to secure their information, ensure that their cloud infrastructure meets the compliance requirements of their government and industry regulations, and know that they can rely on our applications and platforms to have solid run-time and security standards. In an ever-increasing multi-cloud world, our customers need seamless interactions among OpenText applications, and other core applications, on various hyper-scalers or private clouds. 
•
Total revenue growth
We are committed to total revenue growth through organic initiatives, innovation and acquisitions. In addition, we continuously evaluate our businesses that perform or outperform our expectations for revenue growth. This includes:
Deliver Organic Growth
. We are focused on investing and delivering on organic growth. The Information Management market is large and is expected to continue to grow and we expect cloud to be our leading growth driver. We have multiple initiatives that are designed to deliver organic growth including guiding our customers along their AI journey, investing in our data and API and deepening our relationships with our partners and hyper-scalers. As customers move into the cloud, it will facilitate cross-sell and upsell opportunities across the product portfolio and geographies.
Strategically Pursue Acquisitions
. We expect to continue to pursue acquisitions to strengthen our product offerings in the Information Management market. Considering the continually evolving marketplace in which we operate, we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities within the Information Management market and at any time may be in various stages of discussions with respect to such opportunities. We plan to continue to pursue acquisitions that complement our existing business, represent a strong strategic fit and are consistent with our overall growth strategy and disciplined financial management. We may also target future acquisitions to expand or add functionality and capabilities to our existing portfolio of solutions, as well as add new solutions to our portfolio.
Broaden Global Presence
. As customers become increasingly multi-national and as international markets continue to adopt Information Management solutions, we plan to further grow our brand, presence and partner networks in these new markets. We are focused on using our direct sales for targeting existing G10K customers and plan to address new geographies and SMB customers, jointly with our partners.
Broaden Our Information Management Reach into the G10K
. As technologies and customers become more sophisticated, we intend to be a leader in expanding the definition of traditional market sectors. We continue to expand our direct sales coverage of the G10K as we focus on connecting this marquee customer base to our information platform.
Deepen Existing Customer Footprint
. We believe one of our greatest opportunities is to sell newly developed or acquired technologies to our existing customer base, and cross-sell historical OpenText products to newly acquired customers. We have significant expertise in a number of industry sectors and aim to increase our customer penetration based on our strong credentials. We are particularly focused on circumstances where the customer is looking to consolidate multiple vendors with solutions from a single source while addressing a broader spectrum of business problems or equally new or existing customers looking to take a more holistic approach to digital transformation.
Deepen Strategic Partnerships
. OpenText is committed culturally, programmatically and strategically to be a partner-embracing company. Our partnerships with companies such as SAP SE, Google Cloud, AWS, Microsoft Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Salesforce.com Corporation and others serve as examples of how we are working together with our partners to create next-generation Information Management solutions and 
11

deliver them to market. We will continue to look for ways to create more customer value from our strategic partnerships.
•
Achieving Operational Excellence
OpenText maintains a history and culture of focus on efficiency and profitability. We focus on driving margin and earnings expansion, free cash flow growth, and capital return. Expanding profitability, which will ultimately drive cash flow growth, which helps fuel our innovation, broaden our go-to-market distribution and identify and execute acquisitions. 
Consistent with our strategic priorities, we are committed to continuing our investment in the OpenText Cloud to better suit the evolving needs of our customers. Over the last three fiscal years, we have invested a cumulative total of $2.3 billion in R&D or 14.8% 
of cumulative revenue for that three-year period. With our innovation roadmap delivered, we believe we have fortified our support for customer choice: private cloud, public cloud, off-cloud, and API cloud.
Looking ahead, innovation continues to move to the cloud. Businesses rely on a mix of public and private clouds, managed services, and off-cloud options. We’re modernizing our infrastructure and building on our OpenText Cloud investments to meet customers where they are. Our cloud-native applications, combined with public cloud partners and managed services, provide secure, scalable solutions. With multi-tenant SaaS and embedded AI across our portfolio—including Titanium X—we aim to deliver greater flexibility, productivity, and choice.
Our investments in R&D push product innovation, increasing the value of our offerings to our installed customer base and new customers, which includes G10K, enterprise companies, public sector agencies, mid-market companies, SMB and consumers. The G10K are the world’s largest companies, ranked by estimated total revenues, as well as the world's largest governments and global organizations. More valuable products, coupled with our established global partner program, lead to greater distribution and cross-selling opportunities which further help us to achieve organic growth.  
We remain a value-oriented and disciplined acquirer, having efficiently deployed $11.8 billion on acquisitions over the last 10 fiscal years. We look for companies that are situated within our total addressable markets.
We see our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and assets into our business as a strength and pursuing acquisitions is an important aspect to our Total Growth strategy. We expect to continue to acquire, to integrate and innovate, and to deepen and strengthen our Information Management platform for customers.
We regularly evaluate acquisition and divestiture opportunities and at any time may be at various stages of discussion with respect to such opportunities. For additional details on our acquisitions, see “Acquisitions and Divestitures During the Last Five Fiscal Years,” elsewhere in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
OpenText Revenues
Our business consists of four revenue streams: cloud services and subscriptions, customer support, license and professional service and other. For information regarding our revenues by significant geographic area for Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023, see Note 20 “Segment Information” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cloud Services and Subscriptions
Cloud services and subscriptions revenues consist of (i) software as a service (SaaS) offerings, (ii) APIs and data services, and (iii) private cloud that includes hosted services and managed service arrangements. These offerings allow customers to transmit a variety of content between various mediums and to securely manage enterprise information without the commitment of investing in related hardware infrastructure.
OpenText expects the cloud to be our largest driver of growth. Supported by a global, scalable and secure infrastructure, OpenText Cloud Editions includes a foundational platform of technology services, and packaged business applications for industry and business processes. Managed services provide an end-to-end fully outsourced B2B integration solution to our customers, including program implementation, operational management and customer support.
Customer Support
The first year of our customer support offering is usually purchased by customers together with the license of our Information Management software products. Customer support is typically renewed on an annual basis and historically customer support revenues have been a significant portion of our total revenue. Through our OpenText customer support programs, customers receive access to software and security upgrades, a knowledge base, discussion boards, product information and an online mechanism to post and review “trouble tickets.” Additionally, our customer support teams handle 
12

of
 C
ontents
questions on the use, configuration and functionality of OpenText products and help identify software issues, develop solutions and document enhancement requests for consideration in future product releases.
License
License revenues consist of fees earned from the licensing of software products to our customers. Our license revenues are impacted by the strength of general economic and industry conditions, the competitive strength of our software products and our acquisitions. The decision by a customer to license our software products often involves a comprehensive implementation process across the customer’s network or networks and the licensing and implementation of our software products may entail a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers.
Professional Service and Other
We provide consulting and learning services to customers. Generally, these services relate to the implementation, training and integration of our licensed product offerings into the customer’s systems.
Our consulting services help customers build solutions that enable them to leverage their investments in our technology and in existing enterprise systems. The implementation of these services can range from simple modifications to meet specific departmental needs to enterprise applications that integrate with multiple existing systems.
Our learning services consultants analyze our customers’ education and training needs, focusing on key learning outcomes and timelines, with a view to creating an appropriate education plan for the employees of our customers who work with our products. Education plans are designed to be flexible and can be applied to any phase of implementation: pilot, roll-out, upgrade or refresher. OpenText learning services employ a blended approach by combining mentoring, instructor-led courses, webinars, eLearning and focused workshops.

We believe the relative importance of each of these factors depends upon the concerns and needs of each specific customer.
Research and Development
The industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological developments, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements and competitive new products and features. As a result, our success, in part, depends on our ability to

continually enhance our existing products in a timely and efficient manner and to develop and introduce new products that meet customer needs while reducing total cost of ownership. 
To achieve these objectives, we have made and expect to continue to make investments in R&D, through internal and third-party development activities, third-party licensing agreements and potentially through technology acquisitions. We expect a significant amount of our future R&D investment will be in cloud-based technologies.
We are committed to advancing our product portfolio through continued investment in research and development activities, with a focus on enabling secure, efficient, and scalable Information Management solutions.
Our product strategy will rely on five pillars:
•
Business AI - AI led roadmaps, not just AI on the roadmap
•
Business Clouds - Secure and connected Information Management
•
Business Technology - Via data cloud and enhanced cloud platforms
•
Business & Consumer Security - Enhancing security for all our customers and products
•
Product Integration - Deepening the integration of our cybersecurity products into Content Cloud and Business Network Cloud products.
Our R&D expenses were $755.9 million for Fiscal 2025, $864.5 million for Fiscal 2024 and $659.2 million for Fiscal 2023. We believe our spending on R&D is an appropriate balance between managing our organic growth and results of operations. 
Acquisitions and Divestitures During the Last Five Fiscal Years
We regularly evaluate acquisition and divestiture opportunities within the Information Management market and at any time may be in various stages of discussions with respect to such opportunities.
Below is a summary of certain significant acquisitions and divestitures we have made over the last five fiscal years.
•
On May 1, 2024, we completed the sale of our AMC business to Rocket Software, Inc. for $2.275 billion in cash before taxes, fees and other adjustments.
•
On January 31, 2023, we acquired Micro Focus, a leading provider of mission-critical software technology and services that help customers accelerate digital transformations, for

$6.2 billion.
•
On December 23, 2021, we acquired Zix, a leader in SaaS based email encryption, threat protection and compliance cloud solutions for SMBs, for $894.5 million.
•
On November 24, 2021, we acquired all of the equity interest in Bricata Inc. (Bricata) for $17.8 million.
We believe in a programmatic approach to growth through tuck-in acquisitions or when they align with our strategic priorities. We expect to carry out programmatic divestitures, when such a strategy presents the best opportunity to monetize long-term returns for mature products. We will remain flexible and allocate our capital accordingly to the highest return scenario. We regularly evaluate such opportunities within the Information Management market and at any time may be in various stages of discussions with respect to such opportunities.
Intellectual Property Rights
Our success and ability to compete depends in part on our ability to develop, protect and maintain our intellectual property and proprietary technology and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. Our software products are generally licensed to our customers on a non-exclusive basis for internal use in a customer’s organization. We also grant rights to our intellectual property to third parties that allow them to market certain of our products on a non-exclusive or limited-scope exclusive basis for a particular application of the product(s) or to a particular geographic area.
We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary rights. We have obtained or applied for trademark registration for corporate and strategic product names in selected major markets. We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents and pending applications, including patents and rights to patent applications acquired through strategic transactions, which relate to various aspects of our products and technology. The duration of our patents is determined by the laws of the country of issuance and is typically 20 years from the date of filing of the patent application resulting in the patent. From time to time, we may enforce our intellectual property rights through litigation in line with our strategic and business objectives. While we believe our intellectual property is valuable and our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property rights is important to our success, we also believe that our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent, trademark, license, or other intellectual property right.

Human Capital
Our Global Footprint
Our ability to attract, retain and engage a highly skilled workforce committed to innovation, operational excellence and the OpenText mission and values across our global footprint is a cornerstone to our success.
As of June 30, 2025, we employed a total of approximately 21,400 individuals, of which approximately 7,100 or 33% are in the Americas, 4,700 or 22% are in EMEA (as defined below) and 9,600 or 45% are in Asia Pacific. Currently, we have employees in 42 countries enabling strong access to multiple talent pools while ensuring reach and proximity to our customers. See “Results of Operations” included in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our definitions of geographic regions.
The approximate composition of our employee base is as follows: (i) 4,000 employees in sales and marketing, (ii) 7,400 employees in product development, (iii) 3,700 employees in cloud services, (iv) 1,800 employees in professional services, (v) 1,700 employees in customer support and (vi) 2,800 employees in general and administrative roles. 
We believe that relations with our employees are strong. In certain jurisdictions, where it is customary to do so, a “Workers’ Council” or professional union represents our employees.
Employee Engagement, Culture and Values
We have high employee retention levels, and we actively monitor voluntary attrition to ensure we retain our key talent. We also regularly conduct employee research to understand perceptions in the areas of engagement, company strategy, company mission, personal impact, manager effectiveness, recognition, career development and values. Participation level and engagement have remained high. Additional surveys and listening, including feedback from new hires through onboarding surveys as well as regular monitoring of employee retention inform our communication and engagement plan to ensure we create meaningful experiences and support higher productivity and engagement.
Our organizational culture is rooted in the OpenText Way – the business values that guide how we operate. We know that Great People make Great Software. Great people write great software through design that is oriented on their 
Values
: (1) Puts customers first; (2) Tackles challenges head on; (3) Innovates; (4) Helps teams succeed; (5) Cares about people; and (6) Acts ethically.

Our human resource programs and how we operate are informed by these values.
Governance and Impact
Our global impact goals and initiatives are rooted in the OpenText Way – we lean into the strength and foundation of our core values to move us forward. We are committed to our role as a responsible corporate citizen and to delivering the greatest value and impact while complying with all regulatory requirements.
Our charitable giving program supports activities at the local and global level, focused on health, education, innovation, and disaster relief. By investing in the communities where our employees live and work, we facilitate our employees to help  create global impact. We provide employees three paid days off to volunteer to support causes that matter most to them. 
To operate long-term, we need to ensure that our local communities and the natural environment are thriving. We are committed to mitigating any adverse environmental impacts of our business activities, which at a minimum means abiding by all environmental laws, regulations and standards that apply to us. Our Environmental Policy articulates our commitment to measuring and managing our environmental impact.
See “Increasing corporate citizenship expectations, regulatory complexity, and disclosure obligations may negatively impact our business, financial performance, and reputation” in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” included elsewhere within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Compensation and Benefits
Our compensation philosophy is based on a set of principles that align with business strategy, reflect business and individual performance levels, consider market conditions to ensure competitiveness, demonstrate internal pay equity for similar roles and reflect the impact that economic conditions have on pay programs.
Our compensation and benefit programs are regularly reviewed through an executive-sponsored governance process. Across the Company, we offer a wide variety of retirement and group benefits including medical, life and disability, which are designed to protect employees and their dependents against financial hardship due to illness or injury. Programs are designed to recognize the global breadth of our work force and a range of well-being needs. We also have regional Employee Assistance 
16

Programs in many countries that provide 24/7 confidential counselling, support and access to resources for employees and their families. The OpenText Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) is a global benefit program that allows all eligible employees to purchase OpenText shares at a 15% discount and provides the opportunity for employees to strengthen their ownership in the Company while enjoying the benefits of potential share price appreciation. 
Merit-based performance management is a cornerstone of our goals. Our pay programs are carefully designed and governed, from hiring practices to consistency in progression rates based on performance. In designing variable pay for performance awards, we focus only on measurable outcomes rather than subjective measures. This ensures consistent growth opportunities and awards tied to business results.
Employee Education, Training and Compliance
We know that employees join OpenText for continuous learning, experience and credentials to shape their careers. Our strategies focus on ensuring strong technical credentials, building capabilities, new skills sets and a high duty of care in ensuring ethical, secure and compliant practices. All employees have internal access to certification on OpenText and partner products.
Leaders and managers play a key role in the engagement of employees. From a focus on high quality interviewing and onboarding of new hires to the importance of career development planning, we foster a culture and value proposition of career development. Internal applications to job postings are highly encouraged. Our annual Career Week event focuses on career development planning and honing manager skills in developing teams. 
We offer an annual education reimbursement program to all employees globally. This program aligns with our commitment to support internal development, equal opportunity and mobility across all of our geographies, regardless of an employee’s role, function or location. We have designed the education reimbursement program to meet the needs of all personalized development goals through programs that range from technical to business skills. 
As part of our commitment to the highest standards of conduct, all employees and contractors participate in an annual formal Compliance and Data Security Training, including Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (Ethics Code), Responsible Business Practices, Data Protection, Responsible use of AI, Global Data Privacy Practices, Protecting Information and Preventing Sexual Harassment Training. These compliance programs ensure that we operate our business with integrity, following standard business ethics across the globe.
