Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
The following important factors could cause our actual business and financial results to differ materially from our current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections. These forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or made elsewhere by management from time to time are subject to important risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies. The risks discussed below are not necessarily presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence. 
You should read these risk factors in conjunction with the section entitled “Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Risks Related to our Business and Industry
If we do not continue to develop technologically advanced products that successfully integrate with the software products and enhancements used by our customers, future revenues and our operating results may be negatively affected.
Our success depends upon our ability to design, develop, test, market, license, sell and support new software products and services and enhancements of current products and services on a timely basis in response to both competitive threats and marketplace demands. The software industry is increasingly focused on cloud computing, mobility, social media, SaaS and AI, among other continually evolving shifts. In addition, our software products, services and enhancements must remain compatible with standard platforms and file formats. Often, we must integrate software licensed or acquired from third parties with our proprietary software to create new products or improve our existing products. If we are unable to achieve a successful integration with third-party software, we may not be successful in developing and marketing our new software products, services and enhancements. If we are unable to successfully integrate third-party software to develop new software products, services and enhancements to existing software products and services, or to complete the development of new software products and services which we license or acquire from third parties, our operating results will be materially adversely affected. Further, as we develop, acquire and introduce new products and services, including those that incorporate AI, we may be subject to new or heightened legal, ethical and other challenges, which may impact our ability to continue to innovate. In addition, if the integrated or new products or enhancements do not achieve acceptance by the marketplace, our operating results will be materially adversely affected. Moreover, if new industry standards emerge that we do not anticipate or adapt to, or, if alternatives to our services and solutions are developed by our competitors in times of rapid technological change, our software products and services could be rendered less competitive or obsolete, causing us to lose market share and, as a result, harm our business and operating results and our ability to compete in the marketplace.
Product development is a long, expensive and uncertain process, and we may terminate one or more of our development programs.
We may determine that certain software product candidates or programs do not have sufficient potential to warrant the continued allocation of resources. Accordingly, we may elect to terminate one or more of our programs for such product candidates. If we terminate a software product in development in which we have invested significant resources, our prospects may suffer, as we will have expended resources on a project that does not provide a return on our investment, and may have missed the opportunity to have allocated those resources to potentially more productive uses, which may negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.
Our investment in our current research and development efforts may not provide a sufficient or timely return.
The development of information management software products is a costly, complex and time-consuming process, and the investment in information management software product development often involves a long wait until a return is achieved on such an investment. We are making, and will continue to make, significant investments in software research and development and related product and service opportunities. Investments in new technology and processes are inherently speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including the degree of innovation of the software products and services developed through our research and development efforts, sufficient support from our strategic partners and effective distribution and marketing. Accelerated software product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development and the potential introduction of government regulation, including that related to the use of AI, may increase the costs of research and development as well as compliance with such regulation. These expenditures may adversely affect our operating results if they are not offset by corresponding revenue increases. We believe that we must continue to 
18
Tab

dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts in order to maintain our competitive position. However, significant revenues from new software product and service investments may not be achieved for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, new software products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for new software products and services may not be as high as the margins we have experienced for our current or historical software products and services.
If our software products and services do not gain market acceptance, our operating results may be negatively affected.
We intend to pursue our strategy of being a market leading consolidator for cloud-based information management solutions. We intend to grow the capabilities of our information management software offerings through our proprietary research and the development of new software product and service offerings, as well as through acquisitions. It is important to our success that we continue to enhance our software products and services in response to customer demand and to seek to set the standard for information management capabilities. The primary market for our software products and services is rapidly evolving, and the level of acceptance of products and services that have been released recently, or that are planned for future release to the marketplace, is not certain. If the markets for our software products and services fail to develop, develop more slowly than expected or become subject to increased competition, our business may suffer. As a result, we may be unable to: (i) successfully market our current products and services; (ii) develop new software products and services and enhancements to current software products and services; (iii) complete customer implementations on a timely basis; or (iv) complete software products and services currently under development. In addition, increased competition and transitioning from perpetual license sales to subscription-based business model could put significant pricing pressures on our products, which could negatively impact our margins and profitability. If our software products and services are not accepted by our customers or by other businesses in the marketplace, our business, operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.
Failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete effectively.
We are highly dependent on our ability to protect our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions, to establish and maintain our proprietary rights. We intend to protect our intellectual property rights vigorously; however, there can be no assurance that these measures will, in all cases, be successful, and these measures can be costly and/or subject us to counterclaims, including challenges to the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. Enforcement of our intellectual property rights may be difficult, particularly in some countries outside of North America in which we seek to market our software products and services. While Canadian and U.S. copyright laws, international conventions and international treaties may provide meaningful protection against unauthorized duplication of software, the laws of some foreign jurisdictions may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of Canada or the United States. The absence of internationally harmonized intellectual property laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent protection of our proprietary rights. Additionally, the laws and enforcement mechanisms to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use in new technologies like AI and other machine learning technology are evolving and may be inadequate. Software piracy has been, and is expected to be, a persistent problem for the software industry, and piracy of our software products represents a loss of revenue to us. Where applicable, certain of our license arrangements have required us to make a limited confidential disclosure of portions of the source code for our software products, or to place such source code into escrow for the protection of another party. Despite the precautions we have taken, unauthorized third parties, including our competitors, may be able to copy certain portions of our software products or reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Our competitive position may be adversely affected by our possible inability to effectively protect our intellectual property. In addition, certain of our products or proprietary software contain, link to or are derived from open source software. Licensees of open source software may be required to make public certain source code, to license proprietary software for free or to permit others to create derivative works of proprietary software. The use of certain open source software can also expose us to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protection regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. While we monitor and control the use of open source software in our products and in any third-party software that is incorporated into or linked to our products or software, and try to ensure that no open source software is used in such a way that negatively affects our proprietary software, there can be no guarantee that such use does not occur inadvertently, which in turn, could harm our intellectual property position and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, any undetected errors or defects in open source software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our software products, delay the introduction of new solutions, or render our software more vulnerable to breaches or security attacks.
Other companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, which could materially increase costs and materially harm our ability to generate future revenues and profits.
Claims of infringement (including misappropriation and/or other intellectual property violation) are common in the software industry and increasing as related legal protections, including copyrights and patents, are applied to software products.

Although most of our technology is proprietary in nature, we do include certain third-party and open source software in our software products. In the case of third-party software, we believe this software is licensed from the entity holding the intellectual property rights. While we believe that we have secured proper licenses for all material third-party intellectual property that is integrated into our products in a manner that requires a license, third parties have and may continue to assert infringement claims against us in the future.
In particular, our efforts to protect our intellectual property through patent litigation may result in counterclaims of patent infringement by counterparties in such suits. Any such assertion, regardless of merit, may result in litigation or require us to obtain a license for the intellectual property rights of third parties. Such licenses may not be available, or they may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, as we continue to develop software products and expand our portfolio using new technology and innovation, our exposure to threats of infringement may increase. Any infringement claims and related litigation could be time-consuming and disruptive to our ability to generate revenues or enter into new market opportunities and may result in significantly increased costs as a result of our defense against those claims or our attempt to license the intellectual property rights or rework our products to avoid infringement of third-party rights. With certain exceptions, our agreements with our partners and customers typically contain provisions that require us to indemnify them for damages sustained by them as a result of any infringement claims involving our products. Any of the foregoing infringement claims and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results as well as on our ability to generate future revenues and profits.
Our software products and services may contain defects that could harm our reputation, be costly to correct, delay revenues and expose us to litigation.
Our software products and services are highly complex and sophisticated and, from time to time, may contain design defects, software errors, hardware failures or other computer system failures that are difficult to detect and correct. Errors, defects and/or other failures may be found in new software products or services or improvements to existing products or services after delivery to our customers, including as a result of the introduction of new and emerging technologies such as AI. If these defects, errors and/or other failures are discovered, we may not be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner. In addition, despite the extensive tests we conduct on all our software products or services, we may not be able to fully simulate the environment in which our products or services will operate and, as a result, we may be unable to adequately detect the design defects or software or hardware errors that may become apparent only after the products are installed in an end-user’s network, and only after users have transitioned to our services. The occurrence of errors, defects and/or other failures in our software products or services could result in the delay or the denial of market acceptance of our products and alleviating such errors, defects and/or other failures may require us to make significant expenditure of our resources. Customers often use our services and solutions for critical business processes and, as a result, any defect or disruption in our solutions, any data breaches or misappropriation of proprietary information or any error in execution, including human error or intentional third-party activity such as denial of service attacks or hacking, may cause customers to reconsider renewing their contracts with us. The errors in or failure of our software products and services could also result in us losing customer transaction documents and other customer files, causing significant customer dissatisfaction and possibly giving rise to claims for monetary damages. The harm to our reputation resulting from product and service errors, defects and/or other failures may be material. Since we regularly provide a warranty with our software products, the financial impact of fulfilling warranty obligations may be significant in the future. Our agreements with our strategic partners and end-users typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to claims. These agreements regularly contain terms such as the exclusion of all implied warranties and the limitation of the availability of consequential or incidental damages. However, such provisions may not effectively protect us against claims and the attendant liabilities and costs associated with such claims. Any claims for actual or alleged losses to our customers’ businesses may require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or arbitration or to pay significant sums in settlements or damages. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of merit, can be costly and would divert management’s attention and resources. Although we maintain errors and omissions insurance coverage and comprehensive liability insurance coverage, such coverage may not be adequate to cover all such claims. Accordingly, any such claim could negatively affect our business, operating results or financial condition.
Our software products rely on the stability of infrastructure software that, if not stable, could negatively impact the effectiveness of our products, resulting in harm to our reputation and business.
Our development of Internet and intranet applications depends on the stability, functionality and scalability of the infrastructure software of the underlying intranet, such as the infrastructure software produced by Hewlett-Packard, Oracle, Microsoft and others. If weaknesses in such infrastructure software exist, we may not be able to correct or compensate for such weaknesses. If we are unable to address weaknesses resulting from problems in the infrastructure software such that our software products do not meet customer needs or expectations, our reputation, and consequently, our business, may be significantly harmed.

Risks associated with the evolving use of the Internet, including changing standards, competition and regulation and associated compliance efforts, may adversely impact our business.
The use of the Internet as a vehicle for electronic data interchange (EDI) and related services continues to raise numerous issues, including those relating to reliability, data security, data integrity and rapidly evolving standards. New competitors, including media, software vendors and telecommunications companies, offer products and services that utilize the Internet in competition with our products and services, which may be less expensive or process transactions and data faster and more efficiently. Internet-based commerce is subject to increasing regulation by Canadian, U.S. federal and state and foreign governments, including in the areas of data privacy and breaches and taxation. Laws and regulations relating to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers’ ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for Internet-based solutions and restricting our ability to store, process, analyze and share data through the Internet. Although we believe that the Internet will continue to provide opportunities to expand the use of our products and services, we cannot guarantee that our efforts to capitalize on these opportunities will be successful or that increased usage of the Internet for business integration products and services, increased competition or heightened regulation will not adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Unauthorized disclosures, cyber-attacks, breaches of data security and other information technology risks may adversely affect our operations.
Most of the jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations relating to data privacy, security and protection of information. We have certain measures to protect our information systems against unauthorized access and disclosure of personal information and of our confidential information and confidential information belonging to our customers. We have policies and procedures in place dealing with data security and records retention. These measures and policies may change over time as laws and regulations regarding data privacy, security and protection of information change. However, there is no assurance that the security measures we have put in place will be effective in every case, and our response process to incidents may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not be fast enough to prevent or limit harm, or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident. Failures and breaches in security could result in a negative impact for us and for our customers, adversely affecting our and our customers’ businesses, assets, revenues, brands and reputations, disrupting our operations and resulting in penalties, fines, litigation, regulatory proceedings, regulatory investigations, increased insurance premiums, remediation efforts, indemnification expenditures, reputational harm, negative publicity, lost revenues and/or other potential liabilities, in each case depending on the nature of the information disclosed. Security breaches could also affect our relations with our customers, damage our reputation and harm our ability to keep existing customers and to attract new customers. Some jurisdictions, including all U.S. states, Canada and the European Union (EU), have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data, and in some cases our agreements with certain customers require us to notify them in the event of a data security incident. Such mandatory disclosures could lead to negative publicity and may cause our current and prospective customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of our data security measures. These circumstances could also result in adverse impact on the market price of our Common Shares. These risks to our business may increase as we expand the number of web-based and cloud-based products, systems and solutions we offer and as we increase the number of countries in which we operate.
In particular, we are increasingly relying on virtual environments and communications systems, which have been in recent years and may be in the future subjected to third-party vulnerabilities and security risks of increasing frequency, scope and potential harm. Malicious hackers may attempt to gain access to our network or data centers; steal proprietary information related to our business, products, systems, solutions, employees and customers; interrupt our systems and services or those of our customers or others; or attempt to exploit any vulnerabilities in our products, systems or solutions, and such acts may go undetected. Also, the development and proliferation of specific AI applications and other machine learning technologies, alongside related technological innovations, may increase our exposure to cyber-attacks and other cybersecurity risks by potentially enhancing the capabilities of third parties to breach our systems. To address these challenges, we strive to continuously fortify our defenses through strategic investments in advanced security technologies and practices, comprehensive risk management frameworks, and ongoing staff training in efforts to safeguard the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of our data and systems against sophisticated threats, while also enhancing our security posture. Increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated cybercrimes and cyberattacks, including computer viruses and other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial-of-service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking, and other types of attacks, pose a risk to the security and availability of our information technology systems, networks, products, solutions and services, including those that are managed, hosted, provided, or used by third parties (and which may not provide the same level of information security as our own products, systems or solutions), as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and the data of our customers, partners, consumers, employees, stockholders, suppliers and others. Although we monitor our networks and continue to enhance our security protections, hackers are increasingly more sophisticated and aggressive and change tactics frequently, and our efforts may be inadequate to prevent or mitigate all incidents of data breach or theft. A series of issues may also be determined to be material at a later date in the aggregate, even if they may not be material

individually at the time of their occurrence. Furthermore, it is possible that the risk of cyber-attacks and other data security breaches or thefts to us or our customers may increase due to global geopolitical uncertainty, in particular such as the ongoing Russia-Ukraine and Middle East conflicts.
In addition, if data security is compromised, this could materially and adversely affect our operating results given that we have customers that use our systems to store and exchange large volumes of proprietary and confidential information and the security and reliability of our services are of significant importance to these customers. We have experienced attempts by third parties to identify and exploit product and services vulnerabilities, penetrate or bypass our security measures and gain unauthorized access to our or our customers’ or service providers’ cloud offerings and other products, systems or solutions. We may experience future security issues, whether due to human error or misconduct, system errors or vulnerabilities in our or our third-party service providers’ products, systems or solutions. If our products, systems or solutions, or the products, systems or solutions of third-party service providers on whom we rely or may rely in the future, are attacked or accessed by unauthorized parties, it could lead to major disruption or denial of service and access to or loss, modification or theft of our and our customers’ data, which may require us to spend material financial or other resources on correcting the breach and indemnifying the relevant parties and/or on litigation, regulatory investigations, regulatory proceedings, increased insurance premiums, lost revenues, penalties, reputational harm, negative publicity, fines and/or other potential liabilities. If third-party service providers fail to implement adequate data security practices or otherwise suffer a security breach, our or our customer’s data may be improperly accessed, disclosed, used or otherwise lost, which could lead to reputational, business, operating and financial harms. Our efforts to protect against cyber-attacks and data breaches, including increased risks associated with work from home measures, may not be sufficient to prevent or mitigate such incidents, which could have material adverse effects on our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition
.
Business disruptions, including those arising from disasters, pandemics or catastrophic events, may adversely affect our operations.
Our business and operations are highly automated, and a disruption or failure of our systems may delay our ability to complete sales and to provide services. Business disruptions can be caused by several factors, including climate change, natural disasters, global health pandemics, terrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications and system failures, computer viruses, physical attacks and cyber-attacks. A major disaster or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems, including our cloud services, could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations. We operate data centers in various locations around the world and although we have redundancy capability built into our disaster recovery plan, we cannot ensure that our systems and data centers will remain fully operational during and immediately after a disaster or disruption. We also rely on third parties that provide critical services in our operations and despite our diligence around their disaster recovery processes, we cannot provide assurances as to whether these third-party service providers can maintain operations during a disaster or disruption. Global climate change may also aggravate natural disasters and increase severe weather events that affect our business operations, thereby compelling us to build additional resiliency in order to mitigate their impact. Further, in the event of any future global health pandemic, major disaster or other catastrophic event, certain measures or restrictions may be imposed or recommended by governments, public institutions and other organizations, which could disrupt economic activity and result in reduced commercial and consumer confidence and spending, increased unemployment, closure or restricted operating conditions for businesses, inflation, volatility in the global economy, instability in the credit and financial markets, labour shortages and disruption in supply chains. Any business disruption could negatively affect our business, operating results or financial condition.
Our success depends on our relationships with strategic partners, distributors and third-party service providers and any reduction in the sales efforts by distributors, cooperative efforts from our partners or service from third-party providers could materially impact our revenues.
We rely on close cooperation with strategic partners for sales and software product development as well as for the optimization of opportunities that arise in our competitive environment. A portion of our license revenues is derived from the licensing of our software products through third parties. Also, a portion of our service revenues may be impacted by the level of service provided by third-party service providers relating to Internet, telecommunications and power services. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to maintain access to and grow existing channels of distribution and to gain access to new channels if and when they develop. We may not be able to retain a sufficient number of our existing distributors or develop a sufficient number of future distributors. Distributors may also give higher priority to the licensing or sale of software products and services other than ours (which could include competitors’ products and services) or may not devote sufficient resources to marketing our software products and services. The performance of third-party distributors and third-party service providers is largely outside of our control, and we are unable to predict the extent to which these distributors and service providers will be successful in either marketing and licensing or selling our software products and services or providing adequate Internet, telecommunication and power services so that disruptions and outages are not experienced by our customers. A reduction in strategic partner cooperation or sales efforts, a decline in the number of distributors, a decision by our distributors to 
22
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
discontinue the licensing of our software products or a decline or disruption in third-party services could cause users and the general public to perceive our software products and services as inferior and could materially reduce our revenues. In addition, our financial results could be materially adversely affected if the financial condition of our distributors or third-party service providers were to weaken. Some of our distributors and third-party service providers may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions, including economic weakness, industry consolidation and market trends.
The loss of licenses to resell or use third-party software or the lack of support or enhancement of such software could adversely affect our business.
We currently depend upon a limited number of third-party software products. If such software products were not available, we might experience delays or increased costs in the development of our own software products. For a limited number of our product modules, we rely on software products that we license from third parties, including software that is integrated with internally developed software and which is used in our products to perform key functions. These third-party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms and the related software may not continue to be appropriately supported, maintained or enhanced by the licensors. The loss by us of the license to use, or the inability by licensors to support, maintain or enhance any such software, could result in increased costs, lost revenues or delays until equivalent software is internally developed or licensed from another third-party and integrated with our software. Such increased costs, lost revenues or delays could adversely affect our business. For example, with our acquisition of Zix, we extended our partnership with Microsoft by becoming one of their authorized Cloud Solutions Providers in North America. If our key partners were to terminate our relationship, make an adverse change in their reseller program, change their product offerings or experience a major cyber-attack or similar event, it could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business.
Current and future competitors could have a significant impact on our ability to generate future revenues and profits.
The markets for our software products and services are intensely competitive and are subject to rapid technological change and other pressures created by changes in our industry. The convergence of many technologies has resulted in unforeseen competitors arising from companies that were traditionally not viewed as threats to our market position. We expect competition to increase and intensify in the future as the pace of technological change and adaptation quickens and as additional companies enter our markets, including those competitors who offer solutions similar to ours, but offer it through a different form of delivery. Numerous releases of competitive products have occurred in recent history and are expected to continue in the future. We may not be able to compete effectively with current competitors and potential entrants into our marketplace. We could lose market share if our current or prospective competitors: (i) develop technologies that are perceived to be substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies; (ii) introduce new competitive products or services; (iii) add new functionality to existing products and services, including through new and emerging AI applications; (iv) acquire competitive products and services; (v) reduce prices; or (vi) form strategic alliances or cooperative relationships with other companies. 
If other businesses were to engage in aggressive pricing policies with respect to competing products, or if the dynamics in our marketplace resulted in increasing bargaining power by the consumers of our software products and services, we would need to lower the prices we charge for the products and services we offer. This could result in lower revenues or reduced margins, either of which may materially adversely affect our business and operating results. Moreover, our competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers, distributors or third-party service providers. Additionally, if prospective consumers choose methods of information management delivery different from that which we offer, our business and operating results could also be materially adversely affected.
The length of our sales cycle can fluctuate significantly which could result in significant fluctuations in revenues being recognized from quarter to quarter.
The decision by a customer to license our software products or purchase our services often involves a comprehensive implementation process across the customer’s network or networks. As a result, the licensing and implementation of our software products and any related services may entail a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers, accompanied by the attendant risks and delays frequently associated with significant technology implementation projects. Given the significant investment and commitment of resources required by an organization to implement our software products, our sales cycle may be longer compared to other companies within our own industry, as well as companies in other industries. Also, because of changes in customer spending habits, it may be difficult for us to budget, forecast and allocate our resources properly. In weak economic environments, such as a recession or slowdown, it is not uncommon to see reduced information technology spending. It may take several months, or even several quarters, for marketing opportunities to materialize, especially following a prolonged period of weak economic environment. If a customer’s decision to license our software or purchase our services is delayed or if the implementation of these software products takes longer than originally anticipated, the date on which we may recognize revenues from these licenses or sales would be delayed. Such delays and fluctuations could cause our 
23

revenues to be lower than expected in a particular period and we may not be able to adjust our costs quickly enough to offset such lower revenues, potentially negatively impacting our business, operating results and financial condition.
Our existing customers might cancel contracts with us, fail to renew contracts on their renewal dates and/or fail to purchase additional services and products, and we may be unable to attract new customers, which could adversely affect our operating results.
We depend on our installed customer base for a significant portion of our revenues. We have significant contracts with our license customers for ongoing support and maintenance, as well as significant service contracts that provide recurring services revenues to us. In addition, our installed customer base has historically generated additional new license and services revenues for us. Service contracts are generally renewable at a customer’s option and/or subject to cancellation rights, and there are generally no mandatory payment obligations or obligations to license additional software or subscribe for additional services.
If our customers cancel or fail to renew their service contracts or fail to purchase additional services or products, then our revenues could decrease, and our operating results could be materially adversely affected. Factors influencing such contract terminations and failure to purchase additional services or products could include changes in the financial circumstances of our customers, including as a result of any potential recession, dissatisfaction with our products or services, our retirement or lack of support for our legacy products and services, our customers selecting or building alternate technologies to replace our products or services, the cost of our products and services as compared to the cost of products and services offered by our competitors, acceptance of future price increases by us, including due to inflationary pressures, our ability to attract, hire and maintain qualified personnel to meet customer needs, consolidating activities in the market, changes in our customers’ business or in regulation impacting our customers’ business that may no longer necessitate the use of our products or services, general economic or market conditions, or other reasons. Further, our customers could delay or terminate implementations or use of our services and products or be reluctant to migrate to new products. As a result, such customers may not generate the revenues we may have expected within the anticipated timelines, or at all, and may be less likely to invest in additional services or products from us in the future. We may not be able to adjust our expense levels quickly enough to account for any such revenue losses.
Consolidation in the industry, particularly by large, well-capitalized companies, could place pressure on our operating margins which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our business.
Acquisitions by large, well-capitalized technology companies have changed the marketplace for our software products and services by replacing competitors that are comparable in size to our Company with companies that have more resources at their disposal to compete with us in the marketplace. In addition, other large corporations with considerable financial resources either have products and/or services that compete with our software products and services or have the ability to encroach on our competitive position within our marketplace. These companies have considerable financial resources, channel influence and broad geographic reach; thus, they can engage in competition with our software products and services on the basis of price, marketing, services or support. They also have the ability to introduce items that compete with our maturing software products and services. The threat posed by larger competitors and their ability to use their better economies of scale to sell competing products and/or services at a lower cost may materially reduce the profit margins we earn on the software products and services we provide to the marketplace. Any material reduction in our profit margin may have a material adverse effect on the operations or finances of our business, which could hinder our ability to raise capital in the public markets at opportune times for strategic acquisitions or for general operational purposes, which may then, in turn, prevent effective strategic growth or improved economies of scale or put us at a disadvantage to our better capitalized competitors.
We may be unable to maintain or expand our base of SMBs and consumer customers, which could adversely affect our anticipated future growth and operating results.
With the acquisitions of Carbonite and Zix, we have expanded our presence in the SMB market as well as the consumer market. Expanding in this market may require substantial resources and increased marketing efforts, different to what we are accustomed to historically. If we are unable to market and sell our solutions to the SMB market and consumers with competitive pricing and in a cost-effective manner, it may harm our ability to grow our revenues and adversely affect our anticipated future growth and operating results. In addition, SMBs frequently have limited budgets and are more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than larger, more established companies. As such, SMBs may choose to spend funds on items other than our solutions, particularly during difficult economic times, which may hurt our projected revenues, business financial condition and results of operations.

Our sales to government clients expose us to business volatility and risks, including government budgeting cycles and appropriations, early termination, audits, investigations, sanctions, penalties and changes in government spending and policies.
We derive revenues from contracts with U.S. and Canadian federal, state, provincial and local governments and other foreign governments and their respective agencies, which may terminate most of these contracts at any time, without cause. There is increased pressure on governments and their agencies, both domestically and internationally, to reduce spending. Further, our U.S. federal government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations made by the U.S. Congress to fund the expenditures under these contracts. Similarly, our contracts with U.S. state and local governments, Canadian federal, provincial and local governments and other foreign governments and their agencies are generally subject to government funding authorizations. Additionally, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations that could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business. We are also subject to evolving regulatory requirements applicable to government contractors or suppliers. Failure to comply with such requirements could result in investigations, penalties and sanctions, including contract termination, fines, suspension of payments, or suspension or debarment from doing business with such applicable governments, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Geopolitical instability, political unrest, war and other global conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine and Middle East conflicts, have affected and may continue to affect our business.
Geopolitical instability, political unrest, war and other global conflicts may result in adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including volatility in financial markets, adverse changes in trade and tariff policies, inflation, higher interest rates, direct and indirect supply chain disruptions, increased cybersecurity threats and fluctuations in foreign currency. These events may also impact our decision or limit our ability to conduct business in certain areas or with certain entities. For example, sanctions and export controls have been imposed by the United States, Canada and other countries in connection with Russia’s military actions in Ukraine, including restrictions on selling or exporting goods, services or technology to certain regions, and travel bans and asset freezes impacting political, military, business and financial organizations and individuals in or connected with Russia. To support certain of our cloud customers headquartered in the United States or allied countries that rely on our network to manage their global business (including their business in Russia), we have nonetheless allowed these customers to continue to use our services to the extent that it can be done in strict compliance with all applicable sanctions and export controls. However, as the situation continues and the regulatory environment further evolves, we may adjust our business practices as required by applicable rules and regulations. Our compliance with sanctions and export controls could impact the fulfillment of certain contracts with customers and partners doing business in these affected areas and future revenue streams from impacted parties and certain countries. While the Russia-Ukraine and Middle East conflicts have not had and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations or financial condition, it is not possible to predict how these conflicts will unfold and the broader consequences of these conflicts or other conflicts, which could include sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, changes to regional trade ecosystems, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on the global economy, on our business and operations as well as those of our customers, partners and third-party service providers.
Our global operations expose us to risks associated with an evolving international trade and tariff environment, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We conduct business globally and are subject to a complex, dynamic, and evolving international trade, tariff and regulatory environment. Our operations and customer base span multiple countries, which subjects us to a broad range of risks arising from international trade laws and policies. In recent years, trade tensions among major global economies, including the United States, China, Canada, the EU, and others, have escalated, resulting in the imposition and threatened imposition of tariffs, export controls, sanctions, and other trade barriers or restrictive measures. Although recent trade and tariff restrictions have primarily targeted physical goods and manufacturing components, we cannot predict the direction of future trade and tariff policy, including whether additional tariffs or non-tariff barriers will be applied to digital goods and services or whether new regulatory frameworks will be introduced to govern cross-border data flows, digital services taxation, or intellectual property transfers, any of which could impact our business.
Increased protectionist policies, retaliatory trade and tariff actions, or regulatory divergence across jurisdictions may increase our costs, limit our ability to sell products and services in certain markets, delay or prevent the delivery of our services, or compel us to alter our operations to comply with new international trade and tariff laws and policies. Any such developments could disrupt our supply chains, reduce the competitiveness of our offerings, or create uncertainty for our customers and partners. Moreover, we cannot predict the broader macroeconomic impacts of global trade disputes or policy changes, including the effects on foreign exchange rates, inflation, capital markets or economic growth in key markets. Adverse changes in global

trade dynamics could weaken customer demand, delay purchasing decisions, or result in reduced access to critical technologies or skilled talent. These risks could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The restructuring of certain of our operations may be ineffective, may adversely affect our business and our finances, and we may incur additional restructuring charges in connection with such actions.
We often undertake initiatives to restructure or streamline our operations, particularly during the period post-acquisition, such as the Micro Focus Acquisition Restructuring Plan and Business Optimization Plan (each as defined below). We may incur costs associated with implementing a restructuring initiative beyond the amount contemplated when we first developed the initiative, and these increased costs may be substantial. Additionally, such costs would adversely impact our results of operations for the periods in which those adjustments are made. We will continue to evaluate our operations and may propose future restructuring actions as a result of changes in the marketplace, including the exit from less profitable operations, the decision to terminate products or services that are not valued by our customers or adjusting our workforce. Any failure to successfully execute these initiatives on a timely basis, or the failure to realize the expected financial benefits of such strategic initiatives, may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.
For example, we have historically made strategic decisions to implement restructuring activities to streamline our operations, further reduce our real estate footprint around the world, or strategically align our workforce to support our growth and innovation plans. Such steps to reduce costs, and further changes we may make in the future, may negatively impact our business, operations and financial performance in a manner that is difficult to predict. 
For more information on certain restructuring activities, see Note 18 “Special Charges (Recoveries)” to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We must continue to manage our internal resources during periods of company growth, or our operating results could be adversely affected.
The information management market in which we compete continues to evolve at a rapid pace. We have grown significantly through acquisitions and, in conjunction with our plan to de-lever, may continue to review acquisition opportunities as a means of increasing the size and scope of our business. Our growth, coupled with the rapid evolution of our markets, has placed, and will continue to place, significant strains on our administrative and operational resources and increased demands on our internal systems, procedures and controls. Our administrative infrastructure, systems, procedures and controls may not adequately support our operations. In addition, our management may not be able to achieve the rapid, effective execution of the product and business initiatives necessary to successfully implement our operational and competitive strategy. If we are unable to manage growth effectively, our operating results will likely suffer, which may, in turn, adversely affect our business.
If we lose the services of our executive officers or other key employees or if we are not able to attract or retain top employees, our business could be significantly harmed.
Our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees and there is a risk that we could lose their services. We do not maintain “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees. Our success is also highly dependent on our continuing ability to identify, hire, train, retain and motivate highly qualified management, technical, sales and marketing personnel. In particular, the recruitment and retention of top research developers and experienced salespeople, particularly those with specialized knowledge, remains critical to our success, including providing consistent and uninterrupted service to our customers. Competition for such people is intense, substantial and continuous, and we may not be able to attract, integrate or retain highly qualified technical, sales or managerial personnel in the future. In our effort to attract and retain critical personnel, and in responding to inflationary wage pressure, we may experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher prices for our software products or services. In addition, the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
Our compensation structure may hinder our efforts to attract and retain vital employees.
A portion of our total compensation program for our executive officers and key personnel includes the award of options to buy our Common Shares. If the market price of our Common Shares performs poorly, such performance may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract critical personnel. In addition, any changes made to our stock option policies, or to any other of our compensation practices, which are made necessary by governmental regulations or competitive pressures, could adversely affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel. For example, any limit to total compensation that may be prescribed by the government or applicable regulatory authorities or any significant increases in personal income tax levels levied in countries where we have a significant operational presence may hurt our ability to attract or 
26

retain our executive officers or other employees whose efforts are vital to our success. Additionally, payments under our long-term incentive plans (the details of which are described in Item 11 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) are dependent to a significant extent upon the future performance of our Company both in absolute terms and in comparison to similarly situated companies. Any failure to achieve the targets set under our long-term incentive plan could significantly reduce or eliminate payments made under this plan, which may, in turn, materially and adversely affect our ability to retain the key personnel paid under this plan.
Increasing corporate citizenship expectations, regulatory complexity, and disclosure obligations may negatively impact our business, financial performance, and reputation. 
We are facing growing scrutiny and expectations from shareholders, customers, governments, employees, and other key stakeholders regarding corporate citizenship-related practices, disclosures, and performance. These expectations, which continue to evolve, influence business, investment, and procurement decisions and may differ or conflict across stakeholders. At the same time, we are subject to a complex and rapidly changing global regulatory landscape (including laws and emerging frameworks in the U.S., Canada, and the EU) governing corporate citizenship-related disclosures. In particular, legislation in a number of jurisdictions, including the U.S., prohibiting or limiting such disclosures have been enacted or proposed. While certain legislation has been challenged or paused, the imposition of such obligations either now or in the future may cause us to revise our policies and practices, stated targets or disclosure regarding such matters. Further, certain jurisdictions are also introducing anti-ESG (environmental, social and governance) or anti-greenwashing rules, which increase legal uncertainty and reputational risk given the interpretation and application of such rules remain uncertain.
We may incur additional costs and resource demands to meet these expectations, including collecting reliable data (including data such as emissions or waste metrics), complying with inconsistent or contradictory requirements across jurisdictions, and meeting evolving third-party ratings, benchmarks, and regulatory standards. Failure or perceived failure to align with stakeholder values, meet stated targets, or comply with regulatory obligations could harm our reputation, employee engagement, and investor sentiment; reduce customer demand and business opportunities, including impacting our ability to attract and retain certain government contracts; expose us to penalties, litigation, or investigations; and ultimately impact our operating results, financial condition, and competitiveness.
Our workforce includes both remote and hybrid employees, which subjects us to certain operational challenges and risks.
We have implemented flexible remote and hybrid work models across many of our operations. As a result, we continue to be subject to the challenges and risks of having a remote work environment, as well as operational challenges and risks from having a flexible workforce.
For example, employing a remote work environment could affect employee productivity, including due to a lower level of employee oversight, health conditions or illnesses, disruptions due to caregiving or childcare obligations or slower or unreliable Internet access. OpenText systems, client, vendor and/or borrower data may be subject to additional risks presented by increased cyber-attacks and phishing activities targeting employees, vendors, third-party service providers and counterparties in transactions, the possibility of attacks on OpenText systems or systems of employees working remotely as well as by decreased physical supervision. In addition, we may rely, in part, on third-party service providers to assist us in managing monitoring and otherwise carrying out aspects of our business and operations. Such events may result in a period of business disruption or reduced operations, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
A flexible workforce may also subject us to other operational challenges and risks. For example, a hybrid work program may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain personnel who prefer a fully remote work environment. Operating our business with both remote and in-person workers, or workers who work on flexible schedules, could have a negative impact on our corporate culture, decrease the ability of our employees to collaborate and communicate effectively, decrease innovation and productivity, or negatively affect employee morale. In addition, we have incurred costs related to reducing our real estate footprint around the world. If we are unable to effectively continue a flexible workforce, manage the cybersecurity and other risks of remote work, and maintain our corporate culture and employee morale, our financial condition and operating results may be adversely impacted.
For more information regarding the impact of business disruptions on our cybersecurity, see “Business disruptions, including those arising from disasters, pandemics or catastrophic events, may adversely affect our operations.”
Risks Related to Acquisitions and Divestitures
Acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and other business initiatives may negatively affect our operating results.
The growth of our Company through the successful acquisition and integration of complementary businesses is a critical component of our corporate strategy. As a result of the continually evolving marketplace in which we operate, we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities and at any time may be in various stages of discussions with respect to such opportunities. 
27
Tab

 C
ontents
We plan to continue to pursue acquisitions that complement our existing business, represent a strong strategic fit and are consistent with our overall growth strategy and disciplined financial management. We may also target future acquisitions to expand or add functionality and capabilities to our existing portfolio of solutions, as well as to add new solutions to our portfolio. We may also consider, from time to time, opportunities to engage in joint ventures or other business collaborations with third parties to address particular market segments. These activities create risks such as: (i) the need to integrate and manage the businesses and products acquired with our own business and products; (ii) additional demands on our resources, systems, procedures and controls; (iii) disruption of our ongoing business; and (iv) diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns. Moreover, these transactions could involve: (i) substantial investment of funds or financings by issuance of debt or equity or equity-related securities; (ii) substantial investment with respect to technology transfers and operational integration; and (iii) the acquisition or disposition of product lines or businesses. Also, such activities could result in charges and expenses and have the potential to either dilute the interests of existing shareholders or result in the issuance or assumption of debt, which could have a negative impact on the credit ratings of our outstanding debt securities or the market price of our Common Shares. Such acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or other business collaborations may involve significant commitments of financial and other resources of our Company. Any such activity may not be successful in generating revenues, income or other returns to us, and the resources committed to such activities will not be available to us for other purposes. In addition, while we conduct due diligence prior to consummating an acquisition, joint venture or business collaboration, such diligence may not identify all material issues associated with such activities and we may be exposed to additional risk due to such acquisition, joint venture or business collaboration. We may also experience unanticipated difficulties identifying suitable or attractive acquisition candidates that are available for purchase at reasonable prices and that meet our objectives. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not consummate acquisitions successfully that we target in the future. Even if we are able to identify such candidates, we may be unable to consummate an acquisition on suitable terms or in the face of competition from other bidders. Moreover, if we are unable to access capital markets on acceptable terms or at all, we may not be able to consummate acquisitions, or may have to do so on the basis of a less than optimal capital structure. Our inability (i) to take advantage of growth opportunities for our business or for our products and services, or (ii) to address risks associated with acquisitions or investments in businesses, may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition. Additionally, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets acquired in an acquisition or in an investment, or charges associated with any acquisition or investment activity, may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition which, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Shares or credit ratings of our outstanding debt securities.
We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions and divestitures, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. 
We may be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of our acquisitions. As we integrate our acquisitions, we may experience disruptions to our business and, if implemented ineffectively, it could restrict the realization of the full expected benefits. The failure to meet the challenges involved in the integration process and to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, our operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Integrating acquisitions into our business may be disruptive to our business and may adversely affect our existing relationships with employees and business partners. Uncertainties related to the integration of acquisitions may also impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and could divert the attention of our management and other employees from day-to-day business and operations.
Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the due diligence undertaken with respect to any potential acquisition will reveal all relevant facts that may be necessary to evaluate such acquisition or to formulate a business strategy. The information provided during due diligence may be incomplete, inadequate or inaccurate, and as part of the due diligence process, we will also make subjective judgments regarding the results of operations, financial condition and prospects of a potential acquisition opportunity, or its compatibility with our business. If the due diligence investigation fails to correctly identify material issues and liabilities that may be present in a target company or business, or if we consider such material risks to be commercially acceptable relative to the opportunity, and we proceed with an acquisition, we may subsequently fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition or incur substantial impairment charges or other losses.
Many of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, including restructuring charges, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We may be unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses or do so within the intended timeframes, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business prospects.
Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquired businesses will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully and efficiently integrate acquired businesses and operations with our own. The integration of acquired businesses with our existing 
28
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
business will be complex, costly and time-consuming, and may result in additional demands on our resources, systems, procedures and controls, disruption of our ongoing business and diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns. Although we cannot be certain of the degree and scope of operational and integration problems that may arise, the difficulties and risks associated with the integration of acquired businesses, which may be complex and time-consuming, may include, among others:
•
the increased scope and complexity of our operations;
•
coordinating geographically separate organizations, operations, relationships and facilities, including coordinating and integrating (i) independent research and development and engineering teams across technologies and product platforms to enhance product development while reducing costs and (ii) sales and marketing efforts to effectively position the combined company’s capabilities and the direction of product development;
•
integrating (i) personnel with diverse business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies, and (ii) the standards, policies and compensation structures, as well as the complex systems, technology, networks and other assets, of the businesses;
•
successfully managing relationships with our strategic partners and combined supplier and customer base;
•
implementing expected cost synergies of the acquisitions;
•
retention of key employees;
•
the diversion of management attention from other important business objectives;
•
the possibility that we may have failed to discover obligations of acquired businesses or risks associated with those businesses during our due diligence investigations as part of the acquisition, which we, as a successor owner, may be responsible for or subject to; and
•
provisions in contracts with third parties that may limit flexibility to take certain actions.
As a result of these difficulties and risks, we may not accomplish the integration of acquired businesses smoothly, successfully or within our budgetary expectations and anticipated timetables, which may result in a failure to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions. Further, following such transactions, we may continue to incur significant anticipated and unanticipated transaction costs, and these ongoing costs could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid.
Loss of key personnel could impair the integration of acquired businesses, lead to loss of customers and a decline in revenues, or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our operations.
Our success as a combined business with any prior or future acquired businesses will depend, in part, upon our ability to retain key employees, especially during the integration phase of the businesses. It is possible that the integration process could result in current and prospective employees of ours and the acquired business to experience uncertainty about their future roles with us, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to retain or recruit key managers and other employees. If, despite our retention and recruiting efforts, key employees depart, the loss of their services and their experience and knowledge regarding our business or an acquired business could have an adverse effect on our future operating results and the successful ongoing operation of our businesses.
Businesses we acquire may have disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, cybersecurity and compliance with data privacy laws that are weaker than or otherwise not in conformity with ours.
We have a history of acquiring complementary businesses of varying size and organizational complexity and we may continue to engage in such acquisitions. Upon consummating an acquisition, we seek to implement our disclosure controls and procedures, our internal controls over financial reporting as well as procedures relating to cybersecurity and compliance with data privacy laws and regulations at the acquired company as promptly as possible. Depending upon the nature and scale of the business acquired, the implementation of our disclosure controls and procedures as well as the implementation of our internal controls over financial reporting at an acquired company may be a lengthy process and may divert our attention from other business operations. Our integration efforts may periodically expose deficiencies in the disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting as well as procedures relating to cybersecurity and compliance with data privacy laws and regulations of an acquired company that were not identified in our due diligence undertaken prior to consummating the acquisition; contractual protections intended to protect against any such deficiencies may not fully eliminate all related risks. If such deficiencies exist, we may not be in a position to comply with our periodic reporting requirements and, as a result, our business and financial condition may be materially harmed. Refer to Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures”, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for details on our internal controls over financial reporting for recent acquisitions.

Risks Related to Laws and Regulatory Compliance
Our provision for income taxes and effective income tax rate may vary significantly and may adversely affect our results of operations and cash resources.
Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. Various internal and external factors may have favourable or unfavourable effects on our future provision for income taxes, income taxes receivable and our effective income tax rate. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates, results of audits by tax authorities, changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations, changes in estimates of prior years’ items, the impact of transactions we complete, future levels of research and development spending, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, transfer pricing adjustments, changes in the overall mix of income among the different jurisdictions in which we operate and changes in overall levels of income before taxes. For instance, the provision for income taxes from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which required capitalization and amortization of research and development costs starting in Fiscal 2023, has increased cash taxes. Subsequent to the year ended June 30, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the OBBBA) was passed on July 4, 2025. Management is still analyzing the impact of the OBBBA on cash taxes and the effective tax rate. Furthermore, new accounting pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting pronouncements, and/or any internal restructuring initiatives we may implement from time to time to streamline our operations, can have a material impact on our effective income tax rate.
Tax examinations are often complex as tax authorities may disagree with the treatment of items reported by us and our transfer pricing methodology based upon our limited risk distributor model, the result of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome with respect to the taxes we owe may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements, and this difference may materially affect our financial position and financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.
The United Kingdom (UK) tax authorities have challenged certain historic tax filing positions of Micro Focus. Based on Micro Focus’ assessment of the value of the underlying tax benefit under dispute, and as supported by external professional advice, it believed that it had no liability in respect of these matters and therefore no tax charge was recorded in current or previous periods. Although the Company believes that assessment is reasonable, no assurance can be made regarding the ultimate outcome of these matters.
The Company is also subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and significant judgment has been applied in determining its worldwide provision for income taxes, including historical Micro Focus matters related to the EU State Aid and UK tax authority challenge in respect of prior periods. The provision for income taxes may be impacted by various internal and external factors that could have favourable or unfavourable effects, including changes in estimates of prior years’ items, the impact of transactions completed, the structuring of activities undertaken, the application of complex transfer pricing rules, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in overall mix and levels of income before taxes, changes in tax laws, regulations and/or rates and changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. Numerous countries have agreed to a statement in support of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development model rules that propose a global minimum tax rate of 15% for companies with revenue above €750 million, calculated on a country-by-country basis. Countries with significant operations for OpenText that have enacted the legislation include Canada and UK. We are continuing to monitor when and how such rules in other jurisdictions will be enacted into law. However, it is possible that the implementation of relevant legislation could impact our liability for taxes. Further, due to Micro Focus’ complex acquisitive history, we could become subject to additional tax audits in jurisdictions in which we have not historically been subject to examination. As a result, our worldwide provision for income taxes and any ultimate tax liability may differ from the amounts initially recorded and such differences could have an adverse effect on the combined company’s financial condition and results of operations. 
For further details on certain tax matters relating to the Company see Note 14 “Guarantees and Contingencies” and Note 15 “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
As part of the ongoing audit of our Canadian tax returns by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), we have received notices of, and are appealing, reassessments for Fiscal 2012 through Fiscal 2020. An adverse outcome of these ongoing audits could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.
As part of its ongoing audit of our Canadian tax returns, the CRA has disputed our transfer pricing methodology used for certain intercompany transactions with our international subsidiaries and has issued notices of reassessment for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016. Assuming the utilization of available tax attributes (further described below), we estimate our potential aggregate liability, as of June 30, 2025, in connection with the CRA’s reassessments for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, to be limited to penalties, interest and provincial taxes that may be due of approximately $86 million. As of June 30, 2025, we have provisionally paid approximately $32 million in order to fully preserve our rights to object to the CRA’s audit positions, being the minimum payment required under Canadian 
30

legislation while the matter is in dispute. This amount is recorded within Long-term income taxes recoverable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2025.
The notices of reassessment for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 would, as drafted, increase our taxable income by approximately $90 million to $100 million for each of those years, as well as impose a 10% penalty on the proposed adjustment to income. Audits by the CRA of our tax returns for fiscal years prior to Fiscal 2012 have been completed with no reassessment of our income tax liability.
We strongly disagree with the CRA's positions and believe the reassessments of Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 (including any penalties) are without merit, and we are continuing to contest these reassessments. On June 30, 2022, we filed a notice of appeal with the Tax Court of Canada seeking to reverse all such reassessments (including penalties) in full and the customary court process is ongoing.
Even if we are unsuccessful in challenging the CRA's reassessments to increase our taxable income for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, we have elective deductions available for those years (including carry-backs from later years) that would offset such increased amounts so that no additional cash tax would be payable, exclusive of any assessed penalties and interest, as described above.
The CRA has audited Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2020 on a basis that we strongly disagree with and are contesting. The focus of the CRA audit has been the valuation of certain intellectual property and goodwill when one of our subsidiaries continued into Canada from Luxembourg in July 2016. In accordance with applicable rules, these assets were recognized for tax purposes at fair market value as of that time, which value was supported by an expert valuation prepared by an independent leading accounting and advisory firm. CRA’s position for Fiscal 2017 through Fiscal 2020 relies in significant part on the application of its positions regarding our transfer pricing methodology that are the basis for its reassessment of our fiscal years 2012 to 2016 described above, and that we believe are without merit. Other aspects of CRA’s position for Fiscal 2017 through Fiscal 2020 conflict with the expert valuation prepared by the independent leading accounting and advisory firm that was used to support our original filing position. The CRA issued notices of reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 through Fiscal 2020 on a basis consistent with its proposal to reduce the available depreciable basis of assets in Canada. We have filed notices of objection to the reassessments for each of these years. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position, the estimated impact of the proposed adjustment could result in us recording an income tax expense, with no immediate cash payment, to reduce the stated value of our deferred tax assets of up to approximately $470 million. Any such income tax expense could also have a corresponding cash tax impact that would primarily occur over a period of several future years based upon annual income realization in Canada. We strongly disagree with the CRA’s position for Fiscal 2017 through Fiscal 2020 and intend to vigorously defend our original filing position. We are not required to provisionally pay any cash amounts to the CRA as a result of the reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 through Fiscal 2019 due to utilization of available tax attributes; however, for Fiscal 2020 and, to the extent the CRA reassesses subsequent fiscal years on a similar basis, we may be required to make certain minimum payments required under Canadian legislation on a provisional basis while the matter remains in dispute.
We will continue to vigorously contest the adjustments to our taxable income and any penalty and interest assessments, as well as any reduction to the basis of our depreciable property. We are confident that our original tax filing positions were appropriate. Accordingly, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not recorded any accruals in respect of these reassessments or proposed reassessment in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
For further details on these and other tax audits to which we are subject, see Note 14 “Guarantees and Contingencies” and Note 15 “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Risks associated with data privacy issues, including evolving laws and regulations and associated compliance efforts, may adversely impact our business.
Our business depends on the processing of personal data, including data transfer between our affiliated entities, to and from our business partners and customers, and with third-party service providers. The laws and regulations relating to personal data are constantly evolving, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new measures addressing data privacy and processing (including collection, storage, transfer, disposal and use) of personal data. Moreover, the interpretation and application of many existing or recently enacted privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the EU, UK, the U.S. and elsewhere are uncertain and fluid, and it is possible that such laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our products and services. Any such new laws or regulations, any changes to existing laws and regulations and any such interpretation or application may affect demand for our products and services, impact our ability to effectively transfer data across borders in support of our business operations or increase the cost of providing our products and services. Additionally, any actual or perceived breach of such laws or regulations may subject us to claims and may lead to administrative, civil or criminal liability, as well as reputational harm to our Company and our employees. We could also be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices, or modify our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our business.

In the U.S., various laws and regulations apply to the collection, processing, transfer, disposal, unauthorized disclosure and security of personal data. For example, data protection laws passed by all states within the U.S. require notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use, transfer and security of data. The U.S. Congress and state legislatures, along with federal regulatory authorities, have recently increased their attention to matters concerning personal data, and this has and may continue to result in new legislation which could increase the cost of compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 came into effect on January 1, 2020 and was subsequently amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, which took effect January 1, 2023 (the foregoing, collectively, the CCPA). The CCPA requires companies that process information of California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, allows consumers to access and request deletion of their data and opt out of certain data sharing with third parties and provides a new private right of action for data breaches. Violations of the CCPA are enforced by the California Attorney General with sizeable civil penalties, particularly for violations that impact large numbers of consumers. The CCPA also establishes a regulatory agency dedicated to enforcing the requirements of the CCPA. Comprehensive privacy laws also came into effect in in Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia in 2023; in Oregon, Texas, and Montana in 2024; and in Delaware, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Tennessee to date in 2025. Maryland’s comprehensive privacy laws come into effect later this year. Indiana, Kentucky, and Rhode Island have similarly enacted broad laws relating to privacy, data protection and information security that will come into effect in 2026, further complicating our privacy compliance obligations through the introduction of increasingly disparate requirements across the various U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition to government regulation, privacy advocacy and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us or our clients.
Some of our operations are subject to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (the EU GDPR), which took effect from May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation as it forms part of retained EU law in the UK by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 and as amended by the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/419) (the UK GDPR, and together with the EU GDPR, the GDPR), and the UK Data Protection Act 2018. The GDPR imposes a number of obligations for subject companies, and we will need to continue dedicating financial resources and management time to GDPR compliance. The GDPR enhances the obligations placed on companies that control or process personal data including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal data is to be used, mechanisms for obtaining consent from data subjects, controls for data subjects with respect to their personal data (including by enabling them to exercise rights to erasure and data portability), limitations on retention of personal data and mandatory data breach notifications. Additionally, the GDPR places companies under obligations relating to data transfers and the security of the personal data they process. The GDPR provides that supervisory authorities in the EU and the UK may impose administrative fines for certain infringements of the GDPR of up to EUR 20,000,000 under the EU GDPR (or GBP 17,500,000 under the UK GDPR), or 4% of an undertaking’s total, worldwide, annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Individuals who have suffered damage as a result of a subject company’s non-compliance with the GDPR also have the right to seek compensation from such company. Given the breadth of the GDPR, compliance with its requirements is likely to continue to require significant expenditure of resources on an ongoing basis, and there can be no assurance that the measures we have taken for the purposes of compliance will be successful in preventing violation of the GDPR. Given the potential fines, liabilities and damage to our reputation in the event of an actual or perceived violation of the GDPR, such a violation may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. 
In addition, the GDPR restricts transfers of personal data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK to third countries deemed to lack adequate privacy protections unless an appropriate safeguard is implemented. In light of the July 2020 decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union in 
Data Protection Commissioner vs Facebook Ireland Limited and Maximillian Schrems
 (C-311/118) (Schrems II) invalidating the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Irish Data Protection Authority’s May 2023 decision to impose a fine of €1.2 billion on Meta Platforms, Inc. (Meta) regarding Meta’s transfers of personal data to the U.S., there is potential uncertainty with respect to the legality of certain transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK to so-called “third countries” outside the EEA, including the U.S. and Canada. In addition to the increased legal risk in the event of any such transfers, additional costs might also need to be incurred in order to implement necessary safeguards to comply with GDPR. While the Court of Justice of the EU upheld the adequacy of the old standard contractual clauses (SCCs), a standard form of contract approved by the European Commission as an adequate personal data transfer mechanism, it made clear that reliance on them alone may not necessarily be sufficient in all circumstances. In June 2021, the European Commission issued new SCCs that must be now used for relevant new data transfers. The UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office also released two new agreements governing international data transfers out of the UK: the International Data Transfer Agreement (IDTA) and the Data Transfer Addendum (Addendum). All contracts signed after September 21, 2022 must use either the IDTA or the Addendum in conjunction with the new SCCs. Additionally, on March 25, 2022, the U.S. and European Commission announced that they had agreed in principle to a new “Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework” (the TDPF to enable trans-Atlantic data flows and address the concerns raised in the Schrems II decision. To implement the commitments of the U.S. under the TDPF, in October 2022, President Biden signed an 
32
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for the United States Signals Intelligence Activities (the Executive Order). This subsequently prompted the European Commission to adopt an adequacy decision based on the Executive Order on July 10, 2023, having determined that the TDPF ensures that the protection of personal information transferred from the EU to the certified organizations within the U.S. will be essentially equivalent to the protection offered in the EU. However, there remains a degree of legal uncertainty, as critics and privacy advocacy groups have already commenced challenges to the validity of such decision before the Court of Justice of the EU.
Outside of the U.S., the EU and the UK, many jurisdictions have adopted or are adopting new data privacy laws that may impose further onerous compliance requirements, such as data localization, which prohibits companies from storing and/or processing outside the jurisdiction data relating to resident individuals. In Canada, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and various related provincial laws, may apply to our operations. The proliferation of such laws within the jurisdictions in which we operate may result in conflicting and contradictory requirements, particularly in relation to evolving technologies such as cloud computing and AI. Any failure to successfully navigate the changing regulatory landscape could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Privacy-related claims or lawsuits initiated by governmental bodies, customers or other third parties, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, result in costly regulatory proceedings, litigation, penalties, fines, or other potential liabilities, or require us to change our business practices, sometimes in expensive ways. Unfavourable publicity regarding our privacy practices could damage our reputation, harm our ability to keep existing customers or attract new customers or otherwise adversely affect our business, assets, revenue and brands.
Certain of our products may be perceived as, or determined by the courts to be, a violation of privacy rights and related laws. Any such perception or determination could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.
Because of the nature of certain of our products, including those relating to digital investigations, potential customers and purchasers of our products or the general public may perceive that the use of these products results in violations of individual privacy rights. In addition, certain courts or regulatory authorities could determine that the use of our software solutions or other products is a violation of privacy laws, particularly in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. Any such determination or perception by potential customers and purchasers, the general public, government entities or the judicial system could harm our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.
AI and other machine learning technology is being integrated into some of our products, systems or solutions, which could present risks and challenges to our business.
AI and other machine learning technology is being integrated into some of our products, systems or solutions and could be a significant factor in future offerings. While AI can present significant benefits, it can also present risks and challenges to our business. Data sourcing, technology, integration and process issues, program bias in decision-making algorithms, security challenges and challenges with the protection of confidential information and personal privacy could impair the adoption, operation and acceptance of AI. If the output from AI in our products, systems or solutions are deemed to be inaccurate or questionable, or if the use of AI does not operate as anticipated or perform as promised, our business and reputation may be harmed. As the adoption of AI quickens, we expect competition to intensify and additional companies may enter our markets offering similar products, systems or solutions. We may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors and our strategy to integrate AI and other machine learning technology into our products, systems or solutions may also not be accepted by our customers or by other businesses in the marketplace. The integration of AI may also expose us to risks regarding intellectual property ownership and license rights, particularly if any copyrighted material is embedded in training models.
Using AI and other machine learning technologies while the technology is still developing may expose us to liability, reputational harm, and threats of litigation, particularly if such technology produces errors, AI bias, AI hallucinations, harmful content, discrimination, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, data privacy or cybersecurity issues, or otherwise if such technology does not function as intended. Such inaccurate or erroneous outputs may be the result of input data that is insufficient, incorrect, overbroad, outdated or containing biased information. Moreover, with the use of certain AI and other machine learning technologies, there may be a lack of transparency of the sources of data used to train or develop such technologies or how inputs are converted to outputs, and we may not be able to fully validate this process and its accuracy. 
Additionally, the use of AI and other machine learning technologies in connection with the creation or development of intellectual property may present challenges in asserting ownership over the resulting output given the position of courts and intellectual property offices in certain jurisdictions that human inventorship is required for patent protection of an AI-generated invention and human authorship is required for copyright protection of an AI-generated work of authorship. Inventions or works of authorship created through the use of such technologies may be based or rely on, or contain, materials that were used in the training of such technologies and which are subject to third-party intellectual property, which could further limit our ability to obtain intellectual property protection in such inventions or works of authorship. Further, there is a risk that the data 
33
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
inputted into such technologies may contain confidential information, including trade secrets, resulting in such information becoming accessible by third parties. The use of AI, including potential inadvertent disclosure of confidential information or personal data, could also lead to legal and regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, or may give rise to specific obligations, including required notices, consents and opt-outs, under various data privacy, protection and cybersecurity laws and regulations in a number of jurisdictions. See “Risks associated with data privacy issues, including evolving laws and regulations and associated compliance efforts, may adversely impact our business” and “Unauthorized disclosures, cyber-attacks, breaches of data security and other information technology risks may adversely affect our operations.”
The use of copyrighted materials in AI and other machine learning technology has not been fully interpreted by U.S. federal and state, Canadian or international courts and the regulatory framework for AI continues to evolve and remains uncertain. Moreover, regulations relating to AI technologies, including the application of existing legal frameworks to AI technologies, may also impose certain obligations on organizations, and the costs of monitoring and responding to such regulations, as well as the consequences of non-compliance, could have an adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. It is possible that new laws and regulations will be adopted in the jurisdictions in which we operate, or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in new ways, that would affect the way in which AI and other machine learning technology is used in our products, systems or solutions. Further, the cost to comply with such laws or regulations, including court decisions, could be significant. As AI systems are highly complex and rapidly developing, it is not possible to predict all legal, regulatory, operational or technological risks that may arise relating to our use of AI. The risks and challenges associated with integrating AI and other machine learning technology into our products, systems and solutions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Risks Related to our Financial Condition
We may not generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our unfunded pension obligations.
Through our acquisitions, we have assumed certain unfunded pension plan liabilities. We will be required to use the operating cash flow that we generate in the future to meet these obligations. As a result, our future net pension liability and cost may be materially affected by the discount rate used to measure these pension obligations and by the longevity and actuarial profile of the relevant workforce. A change in the discount rate may result in a significant increase or decrease in the valuation of these pension obligations, and these changes may affect the net periodic pension cost in the year the change is made and in subsequent years. We cannot assure that we will generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy these obligations. Any inability to satisfy these pension obligations may have a material adverse effect on the operational and financial health of our business.
For more information on our pension obligations, see Note 12 “Pension Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefits” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect our financial results.
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in U.S. dollars. In general, the functional currency of our subsidiaries is the local currency. For each subsidiary, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the month of the transaction. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, unexpected and dramatic devaluations of currencies in developing, as well as developed, markets could negatively affect our revenues from, and the value of the assets located in, those markets.
Transactional foreign currency gains (losses) are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income under the line item Other income (expense), net. See Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. While we may use derivative financial instruments to attempt to reduce our net exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, could materially affect our financial results. Further, we have other derivative financial instruments that are subject to mark-to-market valuation adjustments based on foreign currency fluctuations. See Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” and Note 23 “Other Income (Expense), Net” to our Consolidated Financial Statements and in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” These risks and their potential impacts may be exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine and Middle East conflicts and any policy changes, including those resulting from trade and tariff disputes. See “Geopolitical instability, political unrest, war and other global conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine and Middle East conflicts, have affected and may continue to affect our business.”

Our indebtedness could limit our operations and opportunities.
As of June 30, 2025, we had $6.5 billion of total indebtedness. This level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to:
•
increasing our debt service obligations, making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;
•
limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general purposes and increasing the cost of any such borrowing;
•
increasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•
expose us to fluctuations in the interest rate environment because the interest rates under our credit facilities are variable; 
•
require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; 
•
limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
•
potentially placing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to certain of our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; 
•
increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing; and
•
restricting us from pursuing certain business opportunities, including other acquisitions.
As of June 30, 2025, our credit facilities consisted of a $2.23 billion Acquisition Term Loan and a $750 million committed revolving credit facility, which is currently undrawn (the Revolver). Borrowings under our credit facilities are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets, which security interests may limit our financial flexibility.
Repayments made under the Acquisition Term Loan are equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount in equal quarterly installments for the life of such loans, with the remainder due at maturity. The terms of the Acquisition Term Loan and Revolver include customary restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to take actions that could be in our best interests. These restrictive covenants include certain limitations on our ability to make investments, loans and acquisitions, incur additional debt, incur liens and encumbrances, consolidate, amalgamate or merge with any other person, dispose of assets, make certain restricted payments, including a limit on dividends on equity securities or payments to redeem, repurchase or retire equity securities or other indebtedness, engage in transactions with affiliates, materially alter the business we conduct, and enter into certain restrictive agreements. The Acquisition Term Loan and Revolver include a financial covenant relating to a maximum consolidated net leverage ratio, which could restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take specified actions. Our failure to comply with any of the covenants that are included in the Acquisition Term Loan and Revolver could result in a default under the terms thereof, which could permit the lenders thereunder to declare all or part of any outstanding borrowings to be immediately due and payable.
As of June 30, 2025, we also have $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 6.90% senior secured notes due 2027 (Senior Secured Notes 2027), $900 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.875% senior notes due 2028 (Senior Notes 2028), $850 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.875% senior notes due 2029 (Senior Notes 2029), $900 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due 2030 (Senior Notes 2030) and $650 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.125% senior unsecured notes due 2031 (Senior Notes 2031 and, together with the Senior Secured Notes 2027, Senior Notes 2028, Senior Notes 2029 and Senior Notes 2030, the Senior Notes) outstanding, respectively issued in private placements to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain persons in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. Our failure to comply with any of the covenants that are included in the indentures governing the Senior Notes could result in a default under the terms thereof, which could result in all or a portion of the Senior Notes to be immediately due and payable.
The risks discussed above would be increased to the extent that we engage in additional acquisitions that involve the incurrence of material additional debt, or the acquisition of businesses with material debt, and such incurrences or acquisitions could potentially negatively impact the ratings or outlook of the rating agencies on our outstanding debt securities and the market price of our common shares.
For more information on our indebtedness, see Note 11 “Long-Term Debt” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Risks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock
Our revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate, which could materially impact the market price of our Common Shares.
We experience significant fluctuations in revenues and operating results caused by many factors, including:
•
Changes in the demand for our software products and services and for the products and services of our competitors; 
•
The introduction or enhancement of software products and services by us and by our competitors; 
•
Market acceptance of our software products, enhancements and/or services; 
•
Delays in the introduction of software products, enhancements and/or services by us or by our competitors; 
•
Customer order deferrals in anticipation of upgrades and new software products; 
•
Changes in the lengths of sales cycles; 
•
Changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors; 
•
Delays in software product implementation with customers; 
•
Change in the mix of distribution channels through which our software products are licensed; 
•
Change in the mix of software products and services sold; 
•
Change in the mix of international and North American revenues; 
•
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and applicable interest rates; 
•
Fluctuations in the value of our investments related to certain investment funds in which we are a limited partner:
•
Acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses; 
•
Restructuring charges taken in connection with any completed acquisition or otherwise; 
•
Outcome and impact of tax audits and other contingencies;
•
Investor perception of our Company;
•
Changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts and our ability to meet those estimates;
•
Changes in laws and regulations affecting our business, including data privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations;
•
Changes in general economic and business conditions, including the impact of any potential recession, or direct and indirect supply chain disruptions and shortages; and 
•
Changes in general political developments, tax policies, international trade and tariff policies and policies taken to stimulate or to preserve national economies. 
A general weakening of the global economy, a continued weakening of the economy in a particular region, economic or business uncertainty or changes in political developments, tax policies, trade and tariff policies or policies implemented to stimulate or preserve economies could result in the cancellation of or delay in customer purchases. A cancellation or deferral of even a small number of license sales or services or delays in the implementation of our software products could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. As a result of the timing of software product and service introductions and the rapid evolution of our business as well as of the markets we serve, we cannot predict whether patterns or trends experienced in the past will continue. For these reasons, you should not rely upon period-to-period comparisons of our financial results to forecast future performance. Our revenues and operating results may vary significantly, and this possible variance could materially reduce the market price or trading volume of our Common Shares. In addition, from time to time, we may present estimates, forecasts, outlook, business models or other forward-looking statements in our press releases, presentations, conference calls or otherwise regarding our future performance that represent estimates as of the date made. These forward-looking statements are based upon a number of assumptions and are based on information known when they are presented and, while there may be numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies, as noted herein, relating to our business, many of which may be beyond our control and are based upon assumptions and risk with respect to future business decisions, some of which may change. Therefore, the actual results we achieve may differ materially from any forward-looking statements, and investors should not rely upon such forward-looking statements in making an investment decision regarding our Common Shares. Further, any perceived failure to achieve such forward-looking statements or meet analysts’ and shareholders’ expectations could also materially reduce the market price or trading volume of our Common Shares.

Changes in the market price of our Common Shares and credit ratings of our outstanding debt securities could lead to losses for shareholders and debt holders.
The market price of our Common Shares and credit ratings of our outstanding debt securities are subject to fluctuations. Such fluctuations in market price or credit ratings may continue in response to: (i) quarterly and annual variations in operating results; (ii) announcements of technological innovations or new products or services that are relevant to our industry; (iii) changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; (iv) changes to the ratings or outlook of our outstanding debt securities by rating agencies; (v) impacts of general economic and market conditions or (vi) other events or factors (including those events or factors noted in this Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” or in Part I, “Forward-Looking Statements” of this Annual Report on 10-K). In addition, financial markets experience significant price and volume fluctuations that particularly affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies in particular due to concerns about increasing interest rates, rising inflation or any potential recession. These fluctuations have often resulted from the failure of such companies to meet market expectations in a particular quarter, and thus such fluctuations may or may not be related to the underlying operating performance of such companies. Broad market fluctuations or any failure of our operating results in a particular quarter to meet market expectations may adversely affect the market price of our Common Shares or the credit ratings of our outstanding debt securities. Additionally, short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions in our Common Shares and technical factors in the public trading market for our Common Shares may produce price movements that may or may not comport with macro, industry or company-specific fundamentals, including, without limitation, the sentiment of retail investors (including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites), the amount and status of short interest in our Common Shares, access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our Common Shares and other technical trading factors. Occasionally, periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities may lead to the institution of securities class action litigation against a company. If we are subject to such volatility in our market price, we may be the target of such securities litigation in the future. Such legal action could result in substantial costs to defend our interests and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, each of which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.
General Risks
Unexpected events may materially harm our ability to align when we incur expenses with when we recognize revenues.
We incur operating expenses based upon anticipated revenue trends. Since a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed, a delay in recognizing revenues from transactions related to these expenses (such a delay may be due to the factors described herein or it may be due to other factors) could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could materially reduce operating income. If these expenses are not subsequently matched by revenues, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
We may fail to achieve our financial forecasts due to inaccurate sales forecasts or other factors.
Our revenues and particularly our new software license revenues are difficult to forecast, and, as a result, our quarterly operating results can fluctuate substantially. Sales forecasts may be particularly inaccurate or unpredictable given general economic and market factors. We use a “pipeline” system, a common industry practice, to forecast sales and trends in our business. By reviewing the status of outstanding sales proposals to our customers and potential customers, we make an estimate as to when a customer will make a purchasing decision involving our software products. These estimates are aggregated periodically to make an estimate of our sales pipeline, which we use as a guide to plan our activities and make internal financial forecasts. Our sales pipeline is only an estimate and may be an unreliable predictor of actual sales activity, both in a particular quarter and over a longer period of time. Many factors may affect actual sales activity, such as weakened economic conditions, including as a result of any potential recession, which may cause our customers and potential customers to delay, reduce or cancel information technology-related purchasing decisions, our decision to increase prices in response to rising inflation, and the tendency of some of our customers to wait until the end of a fiscal period in the hope of obtaining more favourable terms from us. If actual sales activity differs from our pipeline estimate, then we may have planned our activities and budgeted incorrectly, and this may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, for newly acquired companies, we have limited ability to immediately predict how their pipelines will convert into sales or revenues following the acquisition and their conversion rate post-acquisition may be quite different from their historical conversion rate.
Our international operations expose us to business, political and economic risks.
We have significantly increased, and intend to continue to make efforts to increase, our international operations and anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues. These international operations are subject to certain risks and costs, including the difficulty and expense of administering business and compliance abroad, differences in business practices, compliance with domestic and foreign laws (including without limitation domestic 
37
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
and international import and export laws and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including potential violations by acts of agents or other intermediaries), costs related to localizing products for foreign markets, costs related to translating and distributing software products in a timely manner, costs related to increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities, longer sales and collection cycles for accounts receivables, failure of laws or courts to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, local competition, and economic or political instability and uncertainties, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations, trade and tariff policies and actual or anticipated military or geopolitical conflicts. International operations also tend to be subject to a longer sales and collection cycle. In addition, regulatory limitations regarding the repatriation of earnings may adversely affect the transfer of cash earned from international operations. Significant international sales may also expose us to greater risk from political and economic instability, unexpected changes in Canadian, U.S. or other governmental policies concerning import and export of goods and technology, regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers. Additionally, international earnings may be subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction, which may materially adversely affect our effective tax rate. Also, international expansion may be difficult, time consuming and costly. These risks and their potential impacts may be exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine and Middle East conflicts. See “Geopolitical instability, political unrest, war and other global conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine and Middle East conflicts, have affected and may continue to affect our business.” As a result, if revenues from international operations do not offset the expenses of establishing and maintaining international operations, our business, operating results and financial condition will suffer.
We may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us.
From time to time in the ordinary course of our business, we may become involved in various legal proceedings, including commercial, product liability, employment, class action and other litigation and claims, as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings. Such matters can be time-consuming, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Furthermore, because litigation is inherently unpredictable, the results of any such actions may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.
The declaration, payment and amount of dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on a number of factors.
We have adopted a policy to declare non-cumulative quarterly dividends on our Common Shares. The declaration, payment and amount of any dividends will be made pursuant to our dividend policy and is subject to final determination each quarter by our Board of Directors in its discretion based on a number of factors that it deems relevant, including our financial position, results of operations, available cash resources, cash requirements and alternative uses of cash that our Board of Directors may conclude would be in the best interest of our shareholders. Our dividend payments are subject to relevant contractual limitations, including those in our existing credit agreements and to solvency conditions established by the Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA), the statute under which we are incorporated. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any future dividends will be equal or similar in amount to any dividends previously paid or that our Board of Directors will not decide to reduce, suspend or discontinue the payment of dividends at any time in the future.
Our operating results could be adversely affected by any weakening of economic conditions.
Our overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. Certain economies have experienced periods of downturn as a result of a multitude of factors, including, but not limited to, turmoil in the credit and financial markets, concerns regarding the stability and viability of major financial institutions, declines in gross domestic product, increases in unemployment, volatility in commodity prices and worldwide stock markets, excessive government debt, disruptions to global trade or tariffs, inflation, higher interest rates and risks of recession and global health pandemics. The severity and length of time that a downturn in economic and financial market conditions may persist, as well as the timing, strength and sustainability of any recovery from such downturn, are unknown and are beyond our control. Recently, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Middle East conflicts, the inflationary environment and policy changes resulting from trade and tariff disputes have raised additional concerns regarding economic uncertainties. Moreover, any instability in the global economy affects countries in different ways, at different times and with varying severity, which makes the impact to our business complex and unpredictable. During such downturns, many customers may delay or reduce technology purchases. Contract negotiations may become more protracted, or conditions could result in reductions in the licensing of our software products and the sale of cloud and other services, longer sales cycles, pressure on our margins, difficulties in collection of accounts receivable or delayed payments, increased default risks associated with our accounts receivables, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. In addition, deterioration of the global credit markets could adversely impact our ability to complete licensing transactions and services transactions, including maintenance and support renewals. Any of these events, as well as a general weakening of, or declining corporate confidence in, the global economy, or a curtailment in government or corporate spending, could delay or decrease our revenues and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

Stress in the global financial system may adversely affect our finances and operations.
Financial developments seemingly unrelated to us or to our industry may adversely affect us over the course of time. For example, material increases in applicable interest rate benchmarks may increase the interest expense for our credit facilities such as the Acquisition Term Loan and Revolver that have variable rates of interest. Credit contraction in financial markets may hurt our ability to access credit in the event that we identify an acquisition opportunity or require significant access to credit for other reasons. Similarly, volatility in the market price of our Common Shares due to seemingly unrelated financial developments, such as a recession, inflation, the imposition of or uncertainty related to, tariffs or other trade restrictions, or an economic slowdown in the U.S. or internationally, could hurt our ability to raise capital for the financing of acquisitions or other reasons. Potential price inflation caused by an excess of liquidity in countries where we conduct business may increase the cost we incur to provide our solutions and may reduce profit margins on agreements that govern the licensing of our software products and/or the sale of our services to customers over a multi-year period. A reduction in credit, combined with reduced economic activity, may adversely affect businesses and industries that collectively constitute a significant portion of our customer base such as the public sector. As a result, these customers may need to reduce their licensing of our software products or their purchases of our services, or we may experience greater difficulty in receiving payment for the licenses and services that these customers purchase from us. In addition, inflation is often accompanied by higher interest rates, which may cause additional economic fluctuation. Any of these events, or any other events caused by turmoil in world financial markets, may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

Risk Management and Strategy
As a leader in Information Management and cybersecurity we recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats. These risks include, among other things, operational risks; intellectual property theft; fraud; extortion; harm to employees or customers; violation of privacy or security laws and other litigation and legal risk; and reputational risks. 
At OpenText, cybersecurity risk management is an integral part of our overall enterprise risk management program.
 Our cybersecurity risk management program aligns with industry best practices such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework 2.0, and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) ISO/IEC 27001 standard. This provides a framework for identifying, monitoring, evaluating, and responding to cybersecurity threats and incidents, including those associated with the use of our software, applications, services, and cloud and hybrid infrastructures developed or provided by third-party vendors and service providers. Our framework includes steps for identifying the source of a cybersecurity threat or incident, assessing the severity and risk of a cybersecurity threat or incident, implementing cybersecurity mitigation or remediation strategies, and informing our management and our Board of material cybersecurity threats and incidents.
OpenText has a cross-functional incident response team, led by our cybersecurity team and comprised of representatives from our information technology, cybersecurity, finance, and legal teams. The cybersecurity team primarily is responsible for the monitoring and assessment of potential cybersecurity occurrences such as data breaches, intrusions, and other security incidents and implementing our detailed incident response plan. Our incident response plan includes processes and procedures for assessing potential internal and external threats, activation and notification, crisis management, and post-incident recovery designed to safeguard the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the Company and our customers information assets.
Our cybersecurity team is responsible for assessing our cybersecurity risk management program and our incident response plan. We have devoted significant financial and personnel resources to implement security measures to meet regulatory requirements and customer expectations, and we intend to continue to make investments to maintain the security of the Company and its customers data and Information Management infrastructure. 
We have also implemented a review process to assess the security profile and data protection practices of third-party service providers that have exposure to our systems.
 We review and update our cybersecurity policies, standards and procedures annually, or more frequently as needed, to account for changes in the threat landscape, as well as in response to legal and regulatory developments. Our internal audit department has a team responsible for IT and information security (including cybersecurity) audits. 
We also engage third-party cybersecurity consultants to conduct additional audits of our cybersecurity processes, provide assessments of our risk management programs and identify potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
 Our cybersecurity efforts also include mandatory training for all employees and contractors on OpenText’s security and privacy policies as well as other ancillary trainings on topics such as phishing emails and other social engineering tactics.

In Fiscal 2025, we did not identify any cybersecurity threats or incidents or risks of such incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.
 However, despite our efforts, we cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats or incidents or provide assurances that we have not experienced an undetected cybersecurity incident. For more information about these risks, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business and Industry” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Governance
Our Board of Directors is responsible for monitoring and assessing the Company’s cybersecurity risk management as part of its overall responsibility of risk oversight. The Board’s Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing risks related to our accounting, financial statements and financial reporting process, including the Company’s cybersecurity incident materiality assessment and relevant disclosures. For more information, see Part III, Item 11, “Board’s Role in Risk Oversight.”
Our
 current Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) 
has over 20 years of experience architecting and directing global information security functions and possesses the requisite education, skills, experience, and industry certifications expected of an individual assigned to these duties.

Our 
CISO
 is responsible for day-to-day risk management activities, including identifying and assessing cybersecurity risks, establishing processes in an effort to ensure that potential cybersecurity risk exposures are monitored, implementing appropriate mitigation or remediation measures and maintaining cybersecurity programs.

Our CISO receives ongoing communication from relevant teams related to cybersecurity and is responsible for providing a single consolidated view of the Company’s enterprise cybersecurity risk in various industries. OpenText’s CISO reports to the Chief Digital Officer (CDO) who is responsible for OpenText’s broader IT program, which includes the Company’s ability to remediate and recover from a cybersecurity incident while minimizing impacts to the business and operations. Management, including the CDO, updates the Audit Committee and the 
Board of Directors
 on the Company’s cybersecurity programs, material cybersecurity risks, and mitigation or remediation strategies as needed or appropriate.
