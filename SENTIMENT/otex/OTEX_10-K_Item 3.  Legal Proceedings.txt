Item 3.  Legal Proceedings
In the normal course of business, we are subject to various legal claims, as well as potential legal claims.

Dividend Policy
We currently expect to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis. However, future declarations of dividends are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors, in its discretion, based on a number of factors that it deems relevant, including our financial position, results of operations, available cash resources, cash requirements and alternative uses of cash that our Board of Directors may conclude would be in the best interest of our shareholders. Our dividend payments are subject to relevant contractual limitations, including those in our existing credit agreements and to solvency conditions established under the CBCA, the statute under which we are incorporated. We have historically declared dividends in U.S. dollars, but registered shareholders can elect to receive dividends in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars by contacting the Company’s transfer agent.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Share Repurchase Plan
On April 30, 2024, the Board authorized a share repurchase plan (the Fiscal 2024 Repurchase Plan), pursuant to which we were authorized to purchase for cancellation, in open market transactions from time to time over the 12 month period commencing on May 7, 2024 until May 6, 2025, up to an aggregate of $250 million of our Common Shares on the NASDAQ, the TSX (as part of a Fiscal 2024 NCIB, defined below) and/or other exchanges and alternative trading systems in Canada and/or the United States, if eligible, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules. The price that we were authorized to pay for Common Shares in open market transactions was the market price at the time of purchase or such other price as was permitted by applicable law or stock exchange rules.
On July 31, 2024, in order to align our share repurchase plan to our fiscal year, the Board approved the early termination of the Fiscal 2024 Repurchase Plan and authorized a new share repurchase plan (the Fiscal 2025 Repurchase Plan), pursuant to which we were authorized to purchase for cancellation in open market transactions, from time to time over the 12-month period commencing on August 7, 2024 until August 6, 2025, if considered advisable, up to an aggregate of $300 million of our Common Shares on the TSX, the NASDAQ and/or alternative trading systems in Canada and/or the United States, if eligible, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules. 
On March 13, 2025, the Company increased the authorized limit of the Fiscal 2025 Repurchase Plan by $150 million to $450 million and established an automatic share purchase plan (ASPP). The price that we were authorized to pay for Common Shares in open market transactions was the market price at the time of purchase or such other price as was permitted by applicable law or stock exchange rules. The Fiscal 2025 Repurchase Plan was effected in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, and included a normal course issuer bid to provide means to execute purchases over the TSX. Under the terms of the ASPP, the Company’s broker was permitted to make purchases at its sole discretion based on parameters set by the Company in accordance with TSX rules, applicable law and the terms of the ASPP, during periods when the Company would ordinarily not be permitted to make purchases, whether due to regulatory restriction or customary self-imposed blackout periods. Outside of such periods, Common Shares can be purchased based on management's discretion, in compliance with TSX rules and applicable law. All purchases of Common Shares made under the ASPP are included in determining the number of Common Shares purchased under the NCIB.

During the year ended June 30, 2025, we repurchased and cancelled 14,524,664 Common Shares for $418.3 million, inclusive of 2% Canadian excise taxes recorded, under the Fiscal 2025 Repurchase Plan.
On August 6, 2025, the Company renewed its share repurchase plan, pursuant to which we may purchase for cancellation in open market transactions, from time to time over the 12 month period commencing on August 12, 2025 until August 11, 2026, if considered advisable, up to an aggregate of $300 million of its common shares on the TSX (as part of a Fiscal 2026 NCIB, defined below), the NASDAQ and/or alternative trading systems in Canada and/or the United States, if eligible, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules (the Fiscal 2026 Repurchase Plan). The price that we are authorized to pay for Common Shares in open market transactions is the market price at the time of purchase or such other price as is permitted by applicable law or stock exchange rules. The Fiscal 2026 Repurchase Plan will be effected in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, and includes a normal course issuer bid to provide means to execute purchases over the TSX.
Normal Course Issuer Bid
On April 30, 2024, the Company established a Normal Course Issuer Bid (the Fiscal 2024 NCIB) in order to provide it with a means to execute purchases over the TSX as part of the overall Fiscal 2024 Repurchase Plan. The TSX approved the Company’s notice of intention to commence the Fiscal 2024 NCIB, pursuant to which the Company could purchase Common Shares over the TSX for the period commencing on May 7, 2024 until May 6, 2025 in accordance with the TSX's normal course issuer bid rules, including that such purchases be made at prevailing market prices or as otherwise permitted. Under the rules of the TSX, the maximum number of Common Shares that could have been purchased in this period was 13,643,472 (representing 5% of the Company’s issued and outstanding Common Shares as of April 26, 2024), and the maximum number of Common Shares that could have been purchased on a single day was 138,175 Common Shares, which is 25% of 552,700 (the average daily trading volume for the Common Shares on the TSX for the six months ended March 31, 2024), subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, and subject in any case to the volume and other limitations under Rule 10b-18.
On July 31, 2024, the Company voluntarily terminated the Fiscal 2024 NCIB and established a new normal course issuer bid (the Fiscal 2025 NCIB) in order to provide it with a means to execute purchases over the TSX as part of the overall Fiscal 2025 Repurchase Plan. The TSX approved the Company’s notice of intention to commence the Fiscal 2025 NCIB, pursuant to which the Company could purchase Common Shares over the TSX for the period commencing on August 7, 2024 until August 6, 2025 in accordance with the TSX's normal course issuer bid rules, including that such purchases were to be made at prevailing market prices or as otherwise permitted. Under the rules of the TSX, the maximum number of Common Shares that could have been purchased in this period was 21,179,064 (representing 10% of the Company’s public float (calculated in accordance with TSX rules) as of July 24, 2024, less the 5,073,913 Common Shares purchased under the Fiscal 2024 Repurchase Plan), and the maximum number of Common Shares that could have been purchased on a single day was 138,175 Common Shares, which was 25% of 552,700 (the average daily trading volume for the Common Shares on the TSX for the six months ended March 31, 2024), subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, and subject in any case to the volume and other limitations under Rule 10b-18.
On August 6, 2025, the Company renewed its normal course issuer bid (the “NCIB”) in order to provide it with a means to execute purchases over the TSX as part of the overall Fiscal 2026 Repurchase Plan.
The TSX approved the Company’s notice of intention to commence the Fiscal 2026 NCIB, pursuant to which the
Company may purchase Common Shares over the TSX for the period commencing on August 12, 2025 until August 11, 2026 in accordance with the TSX's normal course issuer bid rules, including that such purchases be made at prevailing market prices or as otherwise permitted. Under the rules of the TSX, the maximum number of Common Shares that may be purchased in this period is 24,906,456 (representing 10% of the Company’s public float calculated in accordance with TSX rules) as of July 31, 2025, and the maximum number of Common Shares that can be purchased on a single day is 224,146 Common Shares, which was 25% of 896,585 (calculated in accordance with TSX rules based on the average daily trading volume for the Common Shares on the TSX for the six months ended July 31, 2025), subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, and subject in any case to the volume and other limitations under Rule 10b-18.
Further, as part of the NCIB renewal, the Company has established an ASPP with its broker to facilitate repurchases of the Common Shares.

Canadian Tax Matters
Dividends 
Since June 21, 2013 and unless stated otherwise, dividends paid by the Company to Canadian residents are eligible dividends as per the Income Tax Act (Canada)
.
Non-residents of Canada
Dividends paid or credited to non-residents of Canada are subject to a 25% withholding tax unless reduced by treaty. Under the 
Canada-United States Tax Convention (1980) 
(the Treaty), U.S. residents who are entitled to all the benefits of the Treaty are generally subject to a 15% withholding tax.
Beginning in calendar year 2012, the Canada Revenue Agency has introduced new rules requiring residents of any country with which Canada has a tax treaty to certify that they reside in that country and are eligible to have Canadian non-resident tax withheld on the payment of dividends at the tax treaty rate. Registered shareholders should have completed the Declaration of Eligibility for Benefits (Reduced Tax) under a Tax Treaty for a Non-Resident Person and returned it to our transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services Inc.

United States Tax Matters
U.S. residents
The following discussion summarizes certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to an investment in the Common Shares by a U.S. holder. For purposes of this summary, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of Common Shares that holds such shares as capital assets under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), and is a citizen or resident of the United States and not of Canada, a corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof, or a person that is otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis in respect of Common Shares. It does not address any aspect of U.S. federal gift or estate tax, or of state, local or non-U.S. tax laws and does not address aspects of U.S. federal income taxation applicable to U.S. holders holding options, warrants or other rights to acquire Common Shares. Further, this discussion does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders that are subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax laws, including, but not limited to U.S. holders owning directly, indirectly or by attribution 10% or more of the voting power or value of the Company’s stock; broker-dealers; banks or insurance companies; financial institutions; regulated investment companies; taxpayers who have elected mark-to-market accounting; tax-exempt organizations; taxpayers who hold Common Shares as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” or “conversion transaction” with other investments; individual retirement or other tax-deferred accounts; taxpayers whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; partnerships or the partners therein; S corporations; or U.S. expatriates. 
The discussion is based upon the provisions of the Code, the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, the Convention Between the United States and Canada with Respect to Taxes on Income and Capital, together with related Protocols and Competent Authority Agreements (the Convention), the administrative practices published by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and U.S. judicial decisions, all of which are subject to change. This discussion does not consider the potential effects, both adverse and beneficial, of any recently proposed legislation which, if enacted, could be applied, possibly on a retroactive basis, at any time.
Distributions on the Common Shares
Subject to the discussion below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules,” U.S. holders generally will treat the gross amount of distributions paid by the Company equal to the U.S. dollar value of such dividends on the date the dividends are received or treated as received (based on the exchange rate on such date), without reduction for Canadian withholding tax (see “Canadian Tax Matters - Dividends - Non-residents of Canada”), as dividend income for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of the Company’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. Because the Company does not expect to maintain calculations of its earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles, it is expected that distributions paid to U.S. holders generally will be reported as dividends. 
Individual U.S. holders will generally be eligible to treat dividends as “qualified dividend income” taxable at preferential rates with certain exceptions for short-term and hedged positions, and provided that the Company is not during the taxable year in which the dividends are paid (and was not in the preceding taxable year) classified as a “passive foreign investment company” (PFIC) as described below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules.” Dividends paid on the Common Shares generally will not be eligible for the “dividends received” deduction allowed to corporate U.S. holders in respect of dividends from U.S. corporations. 
If a U.S. holder receives foreign currency on a distribution that is not converted into U.S. dollars on the date of receipt, the U.S. holder will have a tax basis in the foreign currency equal to its U.S. dollar value on the date the dividends are received or treated as received. Any gain or loss recognized upon a subsequent sale or other disposition of the foreign currency, including an exchange for U.S. dollars, will generally be U.S. source ordinary income or loss. 
Subject to limitations and conditions under the Code and applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations, a U.S. holder may be able to claim a foreign tax credit in respect of the amount of Canadian income tax withheld at the appropriate rate from dividends paid to such U.S. holder. These limitations and conditions include requirements adopted by the IRS in regulations promulgated in December 2021 that the Canadian tax would need to satisfy in order to be eligible to be a creditable tax for a U.S. holder. In the case of a U.S. Holder that is eligible for, and properly elects, the benefits of the Treaty, the Canadian tax on dividends will be treated as meeting the new requirements and therefore as a creditable tax. In the case of all other U.S. holders, the application of these requirements to the Canadian tax on dividends is uncertain and we have not determined whether these requirements have been met. If the Canadian dividend tax is not a creditable tax for a U.S. holder or the U.S. holder does not elect to claim a foreign tax credit for any foreign income taxes, the U.S. Holder may be able to deduct the Canadian tax in computing its taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Alternatively, the U.S. holder may deduct such Canadian income taxes from its U.S. federal taxable income, provided that the U.S. holder elects to deduct rather than credit all foreign income taxes for the relevant taxable year. 
46
Tab

For purposes of determining a U.S. holder’s U.S. foreign tax credit limitation, dividends paid by the Company generally will be treated as “passive category” income from sources outside the United States. However, if the Company were to be treated as a United States-owned foreign corporation for any year, the portion of the dividends paid in that year that is attributable to the Company’s United States-source earnings and profits may be re-characterized as United States-source income for foreign tax credit purposes. A United States-owned foreign corporation is any foreign corporation when 50% or more of the value or voting power of its stock is owned by United States persons (directly, indirectly or by attribution). The Company does not expect to calculate its earnings and profits under U.S. federal income tax principles. Therefore, the effect of this rule may cause dividends paid by the Company to be treated as entirely from sources within the United States. This could limit a U.S. holder’s ability to claim a foreign tax credit for any Canadian taxes withheld from the dividends. A U.S. holder entitled to benefits under the Convention may, however, elect to treat dividends paid by the Company as foreign source income for foreign tax credit purposes, subject to certain requirements. The foreign tax credit rules are complex. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the implications of those rules for their investments in the Common Shares.
Sale, Exchange, Redemption or Other Disposition of Common Shares
Subject to the discussion below under “Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules,” the sale of Common Shares generally will result in the recognition of gain or loss to a U.S. holder in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized and the U.S. holder’s adjusted basis in the Common Shares. A U.S. holder’s tax basis in a Common Share will generally equal the price it paid for the Common Share. Any capital gain or loss will be long-term if the Common Shares have been held for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.
Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules
Special U.S. federal income tax rules apply to U.S. persons owning shares of a PFIC. The Company will be classified as a PFIC in a particular taxable year if either: (i) 75 percent or more of the Company’s gross income for the taxable year is passive income, or (ii) the average percentage of the value of the Company’s assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income is at least 50 percent. If the Company is treated as a PFIC for any year, U.S. holders may be subject to adverse tax consequences upon a sale, exchange, or other disposition of the Common Shares, or upon the receipt of certain “excess distributions” in respect of the Common Shares. Dividends paid by a PFIC are not qualified dividends eligible for taxation at preferential rates. Based on audited consolidated financial statements, we believe that the Company was not treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to its 2024 or 2025 taxable years. In addition, based on a review of the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements and its current expectations regarding the value and nature of its assets and the sources and nature of its income, the Company does not anticipate being treated as a PFIC for the 2026 taxable year.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding
Except in the case of corporations or other exempt holders, dividends paid to a U.S. holder may be subject to U.S. information reporting requirements and may be subject to backup withholding unless the U.S. holder provides an accurate taxpayer identification number on a properly completed IRS Form W-9 and certifies that no loss of exemption from backup withholding has occurred. The amount of any backup withholding will be allowed as a credit against the U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the U.S. holder to a refund, provided that certain required information is timely furnished to the IRS.

See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for definitions and reconciliations of GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures. See “Acquisitions” below for the impact of acquisitions on the period-to-period comparability of results.
Acquisitions
As a result of the continually changing marketplace in which we operate, we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities within our market and at any time may be in various stages of discussions with respect to such opportunities. 
Acquisition of Micro Focus
On January 31, 2023, we acquired all of the issued and to be issued share capital of Micro Focus for a total purchase price of $6.2 billion, inclusive of Micro Focus’ cash and repayment of Micro Focus’ outstanding indebtedness. See Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.
Divestiture of AMC Business
On May 1, 2024, the Company completed the AMC Divestiture for $2.275 billion in cash before taxes, fees and other adjustments. Working capital adjustments were finalized during Fiscal 2025 which resulted in a payment of $11.7 million to Rocket Software, and a decrease to the gain on the AMC Divestiture by $4.2 million. For Fiscal 2024, the results of the AMC business from July 1, 2023 through April 30, 2024 were recorded and presented within our Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.
Other Acquisitions 
On August 23, 2023, we acquired all of the equity interest in KineMatik Ltd. (KineMatik), a provider of automated business process and project management solutions built on OpenText’s Content Server. In accordance with ASC Topic 805, “Business Combinations”, this acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The results of operations of KineMatik have been consolidated with those of OpenText beginning August 24, 2023. The results of KineMatik are not considered to be material to our business.
On
 May 22, 2024, we acquired Pillr, a cloud native, multi-tenant MDR platform from Novacoast, Inc. for MSPs that includes powerful threat-hunting capabilities. In accordance with ASC Topic 805, “Business Combinations”, this acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The results of operations of Pillr have been consolidated with those of OpenText beginning May 22, 2024. The results of Pillr are not considered to be material to our business.

Impacts of Geopolitical Conflicts and Diplomatic Tensions
We continue to monitor the geopolitical conflicts and diplomatic tensions around the world, including the Russia-Ukraine and Middle East conflicts. We have ceased all direct business in Russia and Belarus. We continue to operate our Israeli-based business and support our employees in the region. While our operations within these locations are not material and we do not expect these geopolitical conflicts to have a material adverse effect on our overall business, results of operations or financial condition, it is not possible to predict the broader consequences or broader expansion of these conflicts, including adverse effects on the global economy, on our business and operations as well as those of our customers, partners and third-party service providers. For more information, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Outlook for Fiscal 2026
Financial Outlook
As of August 7, 2025, the Company’s full year Fiscal 2026 outlook is as follows:
Metrics
Fiscal 2026 Growth
Total revenues
1% to 2%
Total cloud services and subscriptions revenues
3% to 4%
Adjusted EBITDA Margin
50 bps to 100 bps
Free Cash Flows
17% to 20%
Enterprise Cloud Bookings
12% to 16%
The forward-looking measures and the underlying assumptions involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties, and actual results may vary materially. The Company does not present a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure, Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure because it is impractical to forecast certain items without unreasonable efforts due to the uncertainty and inherent difficulty of predicting, within a reasonable range, the occurrence and financial impact of and the periods in which such items may be recognized.
In addition, we intend to continue our strong capital allocation program with our quarterly dividend and renewed share repurchase program. See Note 26 “Subsequent Events” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Strategic Priorities
We believe our strategic priorities position us well to create both near and long-term shareholder value through organic and inorganic growth, greater capital efficiency and improved profitability. As an organization, we are focused on our three strategic priorities:
•
Expanding our competitive advantage:
 We believe we are well positioned in our key markets to increase our competitive AI-first advantage through our product cycle and leading with Business AI, Business Clouds and Business Security.
We are committed to continuous innovation and invest in our business to increase the value of our offerings to our existing customer base and new customers, which includes Global 10,000 companies (G10K), SMBs and consumers. The G10K are the world’s largest companies, ranked by estimated total revenues, as well as the world's largest governments and global organizations. More valuable products, coupled with our established global partner program, lead to greater distribution and cross-selling opportunities which further help us to achieve organic growth. Over the last three fiscal years, we have invested a cumulative total of $2.28 billion in R&D or 14.8%
 of cumulative revenue for that three-year period. With our innovation roadmap delivered, we believe we have fortified our support for customer choice: private cloud, public cloud, off-cloud, and API cloud.
Looking ahead, innovation continues to move to the cloud. Businesses rely on a mix of public and private clouds, managed services, and off-cloud options. We’re modernizing our infrastructure and building on our OpenText Cloud investments to meet customers where they are. Our cloud-native applications, combined with public cloud partners and managed services, provide secure, scalable solutions. With multi-tenant SaaS and embedded AI across our portfolio—including Titanium X—we aim to deliver greater flexibility, productivity, and choice.
•
Total revenue growth:
 We are committed to total revenue growth through organic initiatives, innovation and acquisitions.

We believe in a programmatic approach to growth through tuck-in acquisitions or when they align with our strategic priorities. We expect to carry out programmatic divestitures, when that is the best opportunity to monetize long-term returns for mature products. We will remain flexible and allocate our capital accordingly to the highest return scenario. We regularly evaluate such opportunities within the Information Management market and at any time may be in various stages of discussions with respect to such opportunities. This strategy will often align to how we assess which of our products are performing compared to outperforming in growth and our capital allocation revenue growth expectations.
•
Achieving Operational Excellence:
 We focus on driving margin and earnings expansion, free cash flow growth, and capital return. We focus on expanding profitability so as to drive cash flow growth, which helps fuel our innovation and capital allocation priorities.
As previously announced, our Business Optimization Plan was designed to support strategic initiatives, integration and simplification efforts following the Micro Focus acquisition, AMC Divestiture and AI-first innovation and growth plans.
As of June 30, 2025, we have incurred $127.9 million of the total expected costs of up to approximately $260.0 million. These costs primarily related to workforce reduction driven by automation, centralization, and simplification, as well as associated real estate footprint reductions globally. On a combined basis, the expansion is expected to result in a total net reduction of approximately 2,000 positions.
The Business Optimization Plan along with other savings initiatives, when fully implemented, is expected to generate total annualized savings of approximately $490.0 million to $550.0 million. The Company has realized approximately 35% of these savings during Fiscal 2025, and expects to realize an additional 35% in Fiscal 2026, with the balance thereafter. The entire business optimization plan is expected to be substantially completed by the second quarter of Fiscal 2027. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details.
Additional Considerations
We conduct business globally and are subject to a complex and evolving international trade environment. Recent trade tensions among major economies, including the United States, Canada, China, the European Union and others, have led to the dissolution of trade agreements, the imposition of tariffs and other restrictive measures. These tariffs and other restrictive measures do not currently target software, services, intangibles or other digital services; however, we cannot predict future trade policy or tariffs, including whether such digital goods and services will be subject to any form of tariffs or other restrictions in the future, or the timing of any impacts thereof. We also cannot predict the impact that such tariffs and other restrictive measures will have on the macroeconomic environment or our customers, which could adversely impact our business and our results of operations.
We will continue to closely monitor the potential impacts of inflation with respect to wages, services and goods, concerns regarding any potential recession, higher interest rates, potential increases or changes in global tariff policies and structures and other trade policies, financial market volatility, the Russia-Ukraine and Middle East conflicts and other geopolitical disputes on our business. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable at that time. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates. The policies listed below are areas that may contain key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates and consequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Some of these accounting policies involve complex situations and require a higher degree of judgment, either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that affect our financial statements. The critical accounting policies which we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:
(i)
Revenue recognition,
(ii)
Goodwill,
(iii)
Acquired intangibles and
(iv)
Income taxes.

For a full discussion of all our accounting policies, see Note 2 “Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Revenue recognition
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (Topic 606), we account for a customer contract when we obtain written approval, the contract is committed, the rights of the parties, including the payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of collection. Revenue is recognized when, or as, control of a promised product or service is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for our products and services (at its transaction price). Estimates of variable consideration and the determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on readily available information, which may include historical, current and forecasted information, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and specific facts and circumstances of each arrangement. We report revenue net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue producing transactions.
We have four revenue streams: cloud services and subscriptions, customer support, license and professional service and other.
Cloud services and subscriptions revenue
Cloud services and subscriptions revenue are from hosting arrangements where, in connection with the licensing of software, the end user does not take possession of the software, as well as from end-to-end fully outsourced B2B integration solutions to our customers (collectively referred to as cloud arrangements). The software application resides on our hardware or that of a third-party, and the customer accesses and uses the software on an as-needed basis. Our cloud arrangements can be broadly categorized as “platform as a service” (PaaS), SaaS, cloud subscriptions and managed services.
PaaS/ SaaS/ Cloud Subscriptions (collectively referred to here as cloud-based solutions):
 We offer cloud-based solutions that provide customers the right to access our software through the internet. Our cloud-based solutions represent a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. These services are made available to the customer continuously throughout the contractual period. However, the extent to which the customer uses the services may vary at the customer’s discretion. The payment for cloud-based solutions may be received either at inception of the arrangement, or over the term of the arrangement.
These cloud-based solutions are considered to have a single performance obligation where the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit, and as such we recognize revenue for these cloud-based solutions ratably over the term of the contractual agreement. For example, revenue related to cloud-based solutions that are provided on a usage basis, such as the number of users, is recognized based on a customer’s utilization of the services in a given period.
Additionally, a software license is present in a cloud-based solutions arrangement if all of the following criteria are met:
(i)
The customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time without significant penalty; and
(ii)
It is feasible for the customer to host the software independent of us.
In these cases where a software license is present in a cloud-based solutions arrangement it is assessed to determine if it is distinct from the cloud-based solutions arrangement. The revenue allocated to the distinct software license would be recognized at the point in time the software license is transferred to the customer, whereas the revenue allocated to the hosting performance obligation would be recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the contractual term unless evidence suggests that revenue is earned, or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern over the contractual term of the arrangement.
Managed services:
 We provide comprehensive B2B process outsourcing services for all day-to-day operations of a customers’ B2B integration program. Customers using these managed services are not permitted to take possession of our software and the contract is for a defined period, where customers pay a monthly or quarterly fee. Our performance obligation is satisfied as we provide services of operating and managing a customer’s EDI environment. Revenue relating to these services is recognized using an output method based on the expected level of service we will provide over the term of the contract.
As part of cloud services and subscriptions revenues, in connection with cloud subscription and managed service contracts, we often agree to perform a variety of services before the customer goes live, such as, converting and migrating customer data, building interfaces and providing training. These services are considered an outsourced suite of professional services which can involve certain project-based activities. These services can be provided at the initiation of a contract, during the implementation or on an ongoing basis as part of the customer life cycle. These services can be charged separately on a fixed fee or a time and materials basis, or the costs associated may be recovered as part of the ongoing cloud subscription or 
54
Tab

ontents
managed services fee. These outsourced professional services are considered to be distinct from the ongoing hosting services and represent a separate performance obligation within our cloud subscriptions or managed services arrangements. The obligation to provide outsourced professional services is satisfied over time, with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits as we satisfy our performance obligations. For outsourced professional services, we recognize revenue by measuring progress toward the satisfaction of our performance obligation. Progress for services that are contracted for a fixed price is generally measured based on hours incurred as a portion of total estimated hours. As a practical expedient, when we invoice a customer at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance to date, we recognize revenue at that amount.
Customer support revenue
Customer support revenue is associated with perpetual, term license and off-cloud subscription arrangements. As customer support is not critical to the customers’ ability to derive benefit from their right to use our software, customer support is considered a distinct performance obligation when sold together in a bundled arrangement along with the software.
Customer support consists primarily of technical support and the provision of unspecified updates and upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. Customer support for perpetual licenses is renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Customer support for term and subscription licenses is renewable concurrently with such licenses for the same duration of time. Payments for customer support are generally made at the inception of the contract term or in installments over the term of the maintenance period. Our customer support team is ready to provide these maintenance services, as needed, to the customer during the contract term. As the elements of customer support are delivered concurrently and have the same pattern of transfer, customer support is accounted for as a single performance obligation. The customer benefits evenly throughout the contract period from the guarantee that the customer support resources and personnel will be available to them, and that any unspecified upgrades or unspecified future products developed by us will be made available. Revenue for customer support is recognized ratably over the contract period based on the start and end dates of the maintenance term, in line with how we believe services are provided.
License revenue
Our license revenue can be broadly categorized as perpetual licenses, term licenses and subscription licenses, all of which are deployed on the customer’s premises (off-cloud).
Perpetual licenses
: We sell perpetual licenses which provide customers the right to use software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee, which is generally paid at contract inception. Our perpetual licenses provide a right to use intellectual property (IP) that is functional in nature and have significant stand-alone functionality. Accordingly, for perpetual licenses of functional IP, revenue is recognized at the point-in-time when control has been transferred to the customer, which normally occurs once software activation keys have been made available for download.
Term licenses and Subscription licenses:
 We sell both term and subscription licenses which provide customers the right to use software for a specified period in exchange for a fee, which may be paid at contract inception or paid in installments over the period of the contract. Like perpetual licenses, both our term licenses and subscription licenses are functional IP that have significant stand-alone functionality. Accordingly, for both term and subscription licenses, revenue is recognized at the point-in-time when the customer is able to use and benefit from the software, which is normally once software activation keys have been made available for download at the commencement of the term.
Professional service and other revenue
Our professional services, when offered along with software licenses, consist primarily of technical services and training services. Technical services may include installation, customization, implementation or consulting services. Training services may include access to online modules, or delivering a training package customized to the customer’s needs. At the customer’s discretion, we may offer one, all, or a mix of these services. Payment for professional services is generally a fixed fee or a fee based on time and materials. Professional services can be arranged in the same contract as the software license or in a separate contract.
As our professional services do not significantly change the functionality of the license and our customers can benefit from our professional services on their own or together with other readily available resources, we consider professional services distinct within the context of the contract.
Professional service revenue is recognized over time as long as: (i) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as we perform them, (ii) our performance creates or enhances an asset the customer controls as we perform and (iii) our performance does not create an asset with an alternative use, and we have the enforceable right to payment.
55
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
If all the above criteria are met, we use an input-based measure of progress for recognizing professional service revenue. For example, we may consider total labour hours incurred compared to total expected labour hours. As a practical expedient, when we invoice a customer at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance to date, we will recognize revenue at that amount.
Material rights
To the extent that we grant our customer an option to acquire additional products or services in one of our arrangements, we will account for the option as a distinct performance obligation in the contract only if the option provides a material right to the customer that the customer would not receive without entering into the contract. For example, if we give the customer an option to acquire additional goods or services in the future at a price that is significantly lower than the current price, this would be a material right as it allows the customer to, in effect, pay in advance for the option to purchase future products or services. If a material right exists in one of our contracts, then revenue allocated to the option is deferred and we would recognize revenue only when those future products or services are transferred or when the option expires.
Based on history, our contracts do not typically contain material rights and when they do, the material right is not significant to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Arrangements with multiple performance obligations
Our contracts generally contain more than one of the products and services listed above. Determining whether goods and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or as a single performance obligation may require judgment, specifically when assessing whether both of the following two criteria are met:
•
the customer can benefit from the product or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer; and
•
our promise to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.
If these criteria are not met, we determine an appropriate measure of progress based on the nature of our overall promise for the single performance obligation.
If these criteria are met, each product or service is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation and the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price (SSP) basis.
Standalone selling price
The SSP reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In most cases we can establish the SSP based on observable data. We typically establish a narrow SSP range for our products and services and assess this range on a periodic basis or when material changes in facts and circumstances warrant a review.
If the SSP is not directly observable, then we estimate the amount using either the expected cost plus a margin or residual approach. Estimating SSP requires judgment that could impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized. SSP is a formal process whereby management considers multiple factors including, but not limited to, geographic or regional-specific factors, competitive positioning, internal costs, profit objectives and pricing practices.
Transaction price allocation
In bundled arrangements, where we have more than one distinct performance obligation, we must allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative SSP. However, in certain bundled arrangements, the SSP may not always be directly observable. For instance, in bundled arrangements with license and customer support, we allocate the transaction price between the license and customer support performance obligations using the residual approach because we have determined that the SSP for licenses in these arrangements are highly variable. We use the residual approach only for our license arrangements. When the SSP is observable but contractual pricing does not fall within our established SSP range, then an adjustment is required, and we will allocate the transaction price between license and customer support based on the relative SSP established for the respective performance obligations.
When two or more contracts are entered into at or near the same time with the same customer, we evaluate the facts and circumstances associated with the negotiation of those contracts. Where the contracts are negotiated as a package, we will account for them as a single arrangement and allocate the consideration for the combined contracts among the performance obligations accordingly.

We believe there are significant assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition as discussed above and these assumptions, judgments and estimates could impact the timing of when revenue is recognized and could have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill is periodically reviewed for impairment (at a minimum annually) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of this asset may not be recoverable.
Our operations are analyzed by management and our chief operating decision maker (CODM) as being part of a single industry segment: the design, development, marketing and sales of Information Management software and solutions. Therefore, our goodwill impairment assessment is based on the allocation of goodwill to a single reporting unit.
We perform a qualitative assessment to test our reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of our reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the quantitative assessment of the impairment test is performed. In the quantitative assessment, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired, and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference, but not exceeding the total carrying value of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit, would be recorded.
Our annual impairment analysis of goodwill was performed as of April 1, 2025. Our qualitative assessment indicated that there were no indications of impairment and therefore there was no impairment of goodwill required to be recorded for Fiscal 2025 (no impairments were recorded for Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023, respectively).
Acquired intangibles
In accordance with business combinations accounting, we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Such valuations may require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Acquired intangible assets typically consist of acquired technology and customer relationships.
In valuing our acquired intangible assets, we may make assumptions and estimates based in part on information obtained from the management of the acquired company, which may make our assumptions and estimates inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates we may make in valuing certain of the intangible assets that we acquire include, but are not limited to:
•
future expected cash flows of our individual revenue streams;
•
historical and expected customer attrition rates and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customers;
•
the expected use of the acquired assets; and
•
discount rates.
As a result of the judgments that need to be made, we obtain the assistance of independent valuation firms. We complete these assessments as soon as practical after the closing dates. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Although we believe the assumptions and estimates of fair value we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill, if the changes are related to conditions that existed at the time of the acquisition. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments, based on events that occurred subsequent to the acquisition date, are recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Income taxes
We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes” (Topic 740).
We account for our uncertain tax provisions by using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not, based solely on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained on audit, including the resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if 
57
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
any. The second step is to measure the appropriate amount of the benefit to recognize. The amount of benefit to recognize is measured as the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be realized. The tax position is derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit. On subsequent recognition and measurement, the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be recognized at each reporting date will represent the Company’s best estimate, given the information available at the reporting date, although the outcome of the tax position is not absolute or final. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to liabilities for income taxes within the Provision for income taxes line of our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. These temporary differences are measured using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent that we consider it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining the valuation allowance, we consider factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected taxable income and the character of income tax assets and tax planning strategies. A change to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense.
The Company’s tax positions are subject to audit by local taxing authorities across multiple global subsidiaries and the resolution of such audits may span multiple years. Since tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations, it is uncertain whether some of the Company’s tax positions will be sustained upon audit. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes considers current tax laws, our interpretations of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by domestic and foreign tax authorities. While we believe the assumptions and estimates that we have made are reasonable, such assumptions and estimates could have a material impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements upon ultimate resolution of the tax positions.
For additional details, see Note 15 “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following tables provide a detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition. For each of the periods indicated below, we present our revenues by product type, revenues by major geography, cost of revenues by product type, total gross margin, total operating margin, gross margin by product type and their corresponding percentage of total revenue. 
In addition, we provide Non-GAAP measures for the periods discussed to provide additional information to investors that we believe will be useful as this presentation aligns with how our management assesses our Company’s performance. See “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for a reconciliation of GAAP-based measures to Non-GAAP-based measures.
The comparability of our operating results for the years ended June 30, 2025, June 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023 were impacted by the Micro Focus Acquisition, the results of which were consolidated with those of OpenText beginning February 1, 2023, and the AMC Divestiture, the results of which were excluded from those of OpenText beginning May 1, 2024. As such, consolidated operating results for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2024 included five and twelve months, respectively, of Micro Focus operating results, which included five and ten months, respectively, of AMC business operating results.
Acquisition of Micro Focus
Our total revenues increased by $1,284.6 million across all of our product types in the year ended June 30, 2024, relative to the year ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to revenue contributions from the Micro Focus Acquisition, organic revenue growth, and a favourable impact of $40.5 million of foreign exchange rate changes. The Micro Focus Acquisition contributed $2,210.7 million to our total revenues during the year ended June 30, 2024, of which $1,414.5 million related to customer support revenues and $477.4 million related to license revenues. Micro Focus total revenues increased by $1,234.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.
Total cost of revenues increased by $262.0 million in the year ended June 30, 2024, relative to the year ended June 30, 2023, primarily from cost of revenues of $589.4 million as a result of the Micro Focus Acquisition, an increase of $310.1 million

as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.
Total operating expenses increased by $651.8 million in the year ended June 30, 2024, relative to the year ended June 30, 2023, primarily from operating expenses of $1,325.5 million as a result of the Micro Focus Acquisition, an increase of $564.1 million as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Micro Focus research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses were $1,009.8 million in the year ended June 30, 2024, an increase of $459.4 million as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year.

The Micro Focus results described above include the results of the AMC business prior to the AMC Divestiture on May 1, 2024.
Divestiture of AMC Business
On May 1, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its AMC business to Rocket Software. The AMC business was comprised of the legacy OpenText connectivity business and the legacy Micro Focus AMC business. The comparability of our operating results for the year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the year ended June 30, 2024 was impacted by the divestiture of our AMC business, the results of which were excluded from those of OpenText beginning May 1, 2024. As such, AMC business operating results through April 30, 2024 were included in the consolidated operating results for the year ended June 30, 2024, but were not included in the consolidated operating results for the year ended June 30, 2025.
Our total revenues decreased by $601.2 million, primarily across license and customer support product types, in the year ended June 30, 2025 relative to the year ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to the exclusion of revenue contributions from the AMC business, and after factoring the unfavourable impact of $2.8 million of foreign exchange rate changes. The following table illustrates the revenues contributed by the AMC business during the year ended June 30, 2024.

Transition Services Agreement
In connection with the AMC Divestiture, we entered into a TSA with Rocket Software, whereby we agreed to provide certain transition services to Rocket Software for up to 24 months from the closing date. These transition service costs are reimbursable by Rocket Software. For Fiscal 2025, we billed Rocket Software $31.6 million under the TSA. The following table illustrates the financial statement impact of these TSA reimbursements, which have been recorded as an offset to the respective costs incurred, within our Consolidated Statements of Income. All transition services pursuant to the TSA were completed as of June 30, 2025.

Revenues, Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin by Product Type
1)    Cloud Services and Subscriptions:
Cloud services and subscriptions revenues are from hosting arrangements where in connection with the licensing of software, the end user does not take possession of the software, as well as from end-to-end fully outsourced business-to-business integration solutions to our customers (collectively referred to as cloud arrangements). The software application resides on our hardware or that of a third-party, and the customer accesses and uses the software on an as-needed basis via an identified line. Our cloud arrangements can be broadly categorized as platform as a service, software as a service, cloud subscriptions and managed services.
Beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we have disclosed the cloud renewal rate on a net basis (cloud net renewal rate). This rate includes increases and decreases in renewed contract values driven by product mix, volume and consumption, and changes for price adjustments relating to renewed contract values, which were not part of the historical calculation of the cloud renewal rate. For the year ended June 30, 2025, our cloud net renewal rate, excluding the impact of Carbonite Inc. and Zix Corporation, was 96%. 
Cost of Cloud services and subscriptions revenues is comprised primarily of third-party network usage fees, maintenance of in-house data hardware centers, technical support personnel-related costs and some third-party royalty costs.

Cloud services and subscriptions revenues increased by $36.0 million or 2.0% during the year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the prior fiscal year; up 2.1% after factoring in the unfavourable impact of $1.5 million of foreign exchange rate changes. Geographically, the overall change was attributable to an increase in EMEA of $43.0 million, a decrease in Americas of $5.3 million, and a decrease in Asia Pacific of $1.7 million.
There were 149 cloud services contracts greater than $1.0 million that closed during Fiscal 2025, compared to 129 contracts during Fiscal 2024.
Cost of Cloud services and subscriptions revenues decreased by $15.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was due to a decrease in labour-related costs of $22.1 million, partially offset by an increase in third-party network usage fees of $5.6 million . Overall, the gross margin percentage on Cloud services and subscriptions revenues increased to 62% from 61%.
2)    Customer Support:
Customer support revenues consist of revenues from our customer support and maintenance agreements. These agreements allow our customers to receive technical support, enhancements and upgrades to new versions of our software products when available. Customer support revenues are generated from support and maintenance relating to current year sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods. Therefore, changes in Customer support revenues do not always correlate directly to the changes in license revenues from period to period. The terms of support and maintenance agreements are typically twelve months, and are renewable, generally

on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Our management reviews our customer support renewal rates on a quarterly basis, and we use these rates as a method of monitoring our customer service performance.
Beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we have disclosed the customer support renewal rate on a net basis (customer support net renewal rate). This rate includes increases in renewed contract values driven by volume and consumption, and excludes reductions driven by shifts from customer support renewals where customers migrate to other product types, which were not part of the historical calculation of the customer support renewal rate. For the year ended June 30, 2025, our customer support net renewal rate was 91%.
Cost of Customer support revenues is comprised primarily of technical support personnel and related costs, as well as third-party royalty costs.

License revenues decreased by $208.5 million or 25.0% during the year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the prior fiscal year; down 25.1% after factoring in the favourable impact of $0.4 million of foreign exchange rate changes. The decrease was driven by the exclusion of license revenue contributions as a result of the AMC Divestiture of $138.6 million and license revenues in the prior fiscal year relating to the grant of certain IP rights. Geographically, the overall change was attributable to a decrease in Americas of $115.8 million, a decrease in EMEA of $62.4 million, and a decrease in Asia Pacific of $30.3 million.
During Fiscal 2025, we closed 211 license contracts greater than $0.5 million, of which 79 contracts were greater than $1.0 million, contributing $228.5 million of License revenues. This was compared to 239 license contracts greater than $0.5 million during Fiscal 2024, of which 103 contracts were greater than $1.0 million, contributing $371.7 million of License revenues.

4)    Professional Service and Other:
Professional service and other revenues consist of revenues from consulting contracts and contracts to provide implementation, training and integration services (professional services). Other revenues consist of hardware revenues, which are included within the “Professional service and other” category because they are relatively immaterial to our service revenues. Professional services are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses. Professional service and other revenues can vary from period to period based on the type of engagements as well as those implementations that are assumed by our partner network. 
Cost of Professional service and other revenues consists primarily of the costs of providing integration, configuration and training with respect to our various software products. The most significant components of these costs are personnel-related expenses, travel costs and third-party subcontracting.

Generally, we implement such plans in the context of integrating acquired entities with existing OpenText operations. Actions related to such restructuring plans are typically completed within a period of one year. In certain limited situations, if the planned activity does not need to be

The effective tax rate decreased to a provision of 9.5% for the year ended June 30, 2025, compared to a provision of 36.2% for the year ended June 30, 2024. Tax expense decreased from $264.0 million during the year ended June 30, 2024 to $46.0 million during the year ended June 30, 2025. The decrease in the effective tax rate was driven by a reduced tax impact of internal reorganization, a net decrease in unrecognized tax benefits, change in valuation allowance, a reduction in U.S. BEAT, and an increase expected amended return benefits, partially offset by a reduction in foreign tax credits, and an increase in undistributed earnings.
Numerous countries have agreed to a statement in support of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development model rules that propose a global minimum tax rate of 15% for companies with revenue above €750 million, calculated on a country-by-country basis. Countries with significant operations for Open Text that have enacted the legislation include Canada and UK. We are continuing to monitor when and how such rules in other jurisdictions will be enacted into law. As of the year ended June 30, 2025, the impact of the global minimum tax is not material.
On July 4, 2025, the OBBBA was enacted, introducing amendments to U.S. tax laws with various effective dates. Key income tax-related provisions of the OBBBA include provisions related to bonus depreciation, research and development expenditures, interest expense deductibility, and revisions to international tax regimes. The Company is currently assessing the future implications of these tax law changes.
For information on certain potential tax contingencies, including the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) matter, see Note 14 “Guarantees and Contingencies” and Note 15 “Income Taxes” to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Also see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of balances with banks as well as deposits with original maturities of 90 days or less.
We continue to anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents, as well as available credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements for working capital, contractual commitments, capital expenditures, dividends and operating needs for the next twelve months. Any further material or acquisition-related activities may require additional sources of financing and would be subject to the financial covenants established under our credit facilities. For more details, see “Long-term Debt and Credit Facilities” below. 
As of June 30, 2025, we have recognized a deferred income tax liability of $20.0 million (June 30, 2024—$15.9 million) on taxable temporary differences related to the undistributed earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries and planned periodic repatriations from certain German subsidiaries, that will be subject to withholding taxes upon distribution.
Cash flows from operating activities 
Cash flows from operating activities decreased by $137.1 million during the year ended June 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year due to a decrease in net changes from working capital of $301.1 million primarily from tax payments made related to the AMC Divestiture, offset by an increase in net income after the impact of non-cash items of $164.0 million.
During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2025 we had a days sales outstanding (DSO) of 45 days, compared to our DSO of 43 days during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024. The per day impact of our DSO in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 on our cash flows was $14.6 million and $14.7 million, respectively. In arriving at DSO, we exclude contract assets as these assets do not provide an unconditional right to the related consideration from the customer.
Cash flows from investing activities
Our cash flows from investing activities are primarily on account of acquisitions, divestitures and additions of property and equipment. 
Cash flows from investing activities decreased by $2.2 billion during the year ended June 30, 2025, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in cash consideration received from the AMC Divestiture during Fiscal 2024 of $2.2 billion.
Cash flows from financing activities 
Our cash flows from financing activities generally consist of long-term debt financing and amounts received from stock options exercised by our employees and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) purchases by our employees. These inflows are typically offset by scheduled and non-scheduled repayments of our long-term debt financing and, when applicable, the payment of dividends and/or repurchases of our Common Shares.

Cash flows used in financing activities decreased by $2.1 billion during the year ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the prior fiscal year. This is primarily due to the net impact of the following activities:
(i)
$2.5 billion decrease in prepayments and repayments of long-term debt and the Revolver.
The decreases in cash flows used in financing activities above were partially offset by the following increases:
(i)
$340.8 million related to cash used in the repurchases of Common Shares and treasury stock;
(ii)
$31.5 million related to lower proceeds from the issuance of Common Shares from the exercise of options and the ESPP; and
(iii)
$30.6 million due to net change in TSA obligations driven by cash collections on behalf of Rocket Software related to certain transition services performed by the Company related to the AMC divestiture. All transition services pursuant to the TSA were completed as of June 30, 2025.
Cash Dividends
During the year ended June 30, 2025, we declared and paid cash dividends of $1.05 per Common Share in the aggregate amount of $271.5 million (year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023—$1.00 and $0.9720 per Common Share, respectively, in the aggregate amount of $267.4 million and $259.5 million, respectively).
Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to final determination and discretion of the Board. See Item 5. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters

Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes
Senior Secured Notes 2027

Senior Secured Notes 2027 bear interest at a rate of 6.90% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1, commencing on June 1, 2023. Senior Secured Notes 2027 will mature on December 1, 2027, unless earlier redeemed, in accordance with their terms, or repurchased.
We may redeem all or a portion of the Senior Secured Notes 2027 at any time prior to November 1, 2027 at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes 2027 to be redeemed and (b) the net present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the Par Call Date less interest accrued to the date of redemption, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. On or after the Par Call Date (as defined in the 2027 Indenture, as defined below), the Company may redeem the Senior Secured Notes 2027, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes 2027 being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date.
If we experience one of the kinds of change of control triggering events specified in the indenture governing the Senior Secured Notes 2027 dated as of December 1, 2022, among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors party thereto, The Bank of New York Mellon, as U.S. trustee, and BNY Trust Company of Canada, as Canadian trustee (the 2027 Indenture), we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes 2027 at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes 2027, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.
The 2027 Indenture contains covenants that limit our and certain of the Company’s subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things: (i) create certain liens and enter into sale and lease-back transactions; (ii) create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness of the Company or certain of the Company’s subsidiaries without such subsidiary becoming a subsidiary guarantor of the Senior Secured Notes 2027; and (iii) consolidate, amalgamate or merge with, or convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of the Company’s property and assets substantially as an entirety to, another person.

The Senior Secured Notes 2027 and the related guarantees are effectively senior to all of the Company’s and the guarantors’ senior unsecured debt to the extent of the value of the Collateral (as defined in the 2027 Indenture) and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of each of the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes 2027.

Term Loan B

On May 6, 2024, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the AMC Divestiture to prepay in full the then outstanding principal balance of $940 million under Term Loan B, at which point all remaining commitments under Term Loan B were reduced to zero and Term Loan B was terminated.

Revolver
On December 19, 2023, we amended our committed revolving credit facility (the Revolver) to, among other things, extend the maturity to December 19, 2028. Borrowings under the Revolver are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets, on a pari passu basis with the Acquisition Term Loan (as defined below) and Senior Secured Notes 2027.
The Revolver has no fixed repayment date prior to the end of the term. Borrowings under the Revolver bear interest per annum at a floating rate of interest equal to Term SOFR (as defined in the Revolver) and a fixed margin dependent on our consolidated net leverage ratio ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%. 
Under the Revolver, we must maintain a “consolidated net leverage” ratio of no more than 4.50:1.00 at the end of each financial quarter. Consolidated net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of our total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, over our trailing twelve months net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges. As of June 30, 2025, our consolidated net leverage ratio, as calculated in accordance with the applicable agreement, was 3.25:1.00.
As of June 30, 2025, we had no outstanding balance under the Revolver (June 30, 2024—$0.0 million). 
For further details relating to our debt, see Note 11 “Long-Term Debt” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Acquisition Term Loan
On December 1, 2022, we amended our first lien term loan facility (the Acquisition Term Loan), dated as of August 25, 2022, to increase the aggregate commitments under the senior secured delayed-draw term loan facility from an aggregate principal amount of $2.585 billion to an aggregate principal amount of $3.585 billion. On August 14, 2023, we entered into the second amendment to the Acquisition Term Loan, to reduce the applicable interest rate margin by 0.75% over the remaining term of the Acquisition Term Loan. On May 15, 2024, we entered into the third amendment to the Acquisition Term Loan, to reduce the applicable interest rate margin by 0.5% and remove the 10-basis point credit spread adjustment for loans bearing interest based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) rate. On November 27, 2024, we entered into the fourth amendment to the Acquisition Term Loan to reduce the applicable interest rate margin by 0.5%. The reductions in interest rate margin on the Acquisition Term Loan resulting from the amendments were all accounted for by the Company as debt modifications.
The Acquisition Term Loan has a seven-year term from the date of funding, and repayments under the Acquisition Term Loan are equal to 0.25% of the principal amount in equal quarterly installments for the life of the Acquisition Term Loan, with the remainder due at maturity. Borrowings under the Acquisition Term Loan currently bear a floating rate of interest equal to Term SOFR (as defined in the Acquisition Term Loan) plus an applicable margin of 1.75%. As of June 30, 2025, the outstanding balance on the Acquisition Term Loan bears an interest rate of 6.08%. As of June 30, 2025, the Acquisition Term Loan bears an effective interest rate of 7.12%. The effective interest rate includes interest expense of $148.4 million and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $14.7 million.
The Acquisition Term Loan has incremental facility capacity of (i) $250 million plus (ii) additional amounts, subject to meeting a “consolidated senior secured net leverage” ratio not exceeding 2.75:1.00, in each case subject to certain conditions. Consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of the Company’s total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, that is secured by the Company’s or any of the Company’s subsidiaries’ assets, over the Company’s trailing four financial quarter net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges. Under the Acquisition Term Loan, we must maintain a “consolidated net leverage” ratio of no more than 4.50:1.00 at the end of each financial quarter. Consolidated net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of the Company’s total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, over the Company’s trailing four financial quarter net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges as defined in the Acquisition Term Loan. As of June 30, 2025, our consolidated net leverage ratio, as calculated in accordance with the applicable agreement, was 3.25:1.00.
The Acquisition Term Loan is unconditionally guaranteed by certain subsidiary guarantors, as defined in the Acquisition Term Loan, and is secured by a first charge on substantially all of the assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors on a pari passu basis with the Revolver and the Senior Secured Notes 2027.
On October 20, 2023 and January 22, 2024, the Company made prepayments of $75 million and $175 million, respectively, on the Acquisition Term Loan using cash on hand. On May 6, 2024, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the AMC Divestiture to prepay $1.06 billion of the outstanding principal balance of the Acquisition Term Loan.

Shelf Registration Statement 
On December 15, 2023, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which became effective automatically (the Shelf Registration Statement). The Shelf Registration Statement allows for primary and secondary offerings from time to time of equity, debt and other securities, including Common Shares, Preference Shares, debt securities, depositary shares, warrants, purchase contracts, units and subscription receipts. As the Company qualifies as a “well-known seasoned issuer” in Canada, a short-form base shelf prospectus qualifying the distribution of such securities was concurrently filed with Canadian securities regulators on December 15, 2023. The type of securities and the specific terms thereof will be determined at the time of any offering and will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement to be filed separately with the SEC and Canadian securities regulators.
Share Repurchase Plan / Normal Course Issuer Bid
On April 30, 2024, the Board authorized a share repurchase plan (the Fiscal 2024 Repurchase Plan), pursuant to which we were authorized to purchase for cancellation, in open market transactions from time to time over the 12- month period commencing on May 7, 2024 until May 6, 2025, up to an aggregate of $250 million of our Common Shares on the NASDAQ, the TSX (as part of a Fiscal 2024 NCIB, defined below) and/or other exchanges and alternative trading systems in Canada and/or the United States, if eligible, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules.
On July 31, 2024, in order to align our share repurchase plan to our fiscal year, the Board approved the early termination of the Fiscal 2024 Repurchase Plan and authorized the Fiscal 2025 Repurchase Plan, pursuant to which we were authorized to purchase for cancellation in open market transactions, from time to time over the 12-month period commencing on August 7, 2024 until August 6, 2025, if considered advisable, up to an aggregate of $300 million of our Common Shares on the TSX, the NASDAQ and/or alternative trading systems in Canada and/or the United States, if eligible, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules.
On March 13, 2025, the Company increased the authorized limit of the Fiscal 2025 Repurchase Plan by $150 million to $450 million and established an ASPP. The price that we were authorized to pay for Common Shares in open market transactions was the market price at the time of purchase or such other price as was permitted by applicable law or stock exchange rules. The Fiscal 2025 Repurchase Plan was effected in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, and included a normal course issuer bid to provide means to execute purchases over the TSX. Under the terms of the ASPP, the Company’s broker was permitted to make purchases at its sole discretion based on parameters set by the Company in accordance with TSX rules, applicable law and the terms of the ASPP, during periods when the Company would ordinarily not be permitted to make purchases, whether due to regulatory restriction or customary self-imposed blackout periods. Outside of such periods, Common Shares can be purchased based on management's discretion, in compliance with TSX rules and applicable law. All purchases of Common Shares made under the ASPP are included in determining the number of Common Shares purchased under the NCIB.
During the year ended June 30, 2025, we repurchased and cancelled 14,524,664 Common Shares for $418.3 million, inclusive of 2% Canadian excise taxes recorded (year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023— 5,073,913 and nil Common Shares for $152.3 million and nil, respectively).
Additionally, as of June 30, 2025, we recorded an accrual and a corresponding charge to retained earnings of $24.8 million, representing the estimated value of Common Shares expected to be repurchased following the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2025 pursuant to the ASPP.
On August 6, 2025, the Company renewed its share repurchase plan, pursuant to which we may purchase for cancellation in open market transactions, from time to time over the 12 month period commencing on August 12, 2025 until August 11, 2026, if considered advisable, up to an aggregate of $300 million of its common shares on the TSX (as part of a Fiscal 2026 NCIB, defined below), the NASDAQ and/or alternative trading systems in Canada and/or the United States, if eligible, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules (the Fiscal 2026 Repurchase Plan). The price that we are authorized to pay for Common Shares in open market transactions is the market price at the time of purchase or such other price as is permitted by applicable law or stock exchange rules. The Fiscal 2026 Repurchase Plan will be effected in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, and includes a normal course issuer bid to provide means to execute purchases over the TSX.
Normal Course Issuer Bid
On April 30, 2024, the Company established a Normal Course Issuer Bid (the Fiscal 2024 NCIB) in order to provide it with a means to execute purchases over the TSX as part of the overall Fiscal 2024 Repurchase Plan.
The TSX approved the Company’s notice of intention to commence the Fiscal 2024 NCIB, pursuant to which the Company could purchase Common Shares over the TSX for the period commencing on May 7, 2024 until May 6, 2025 in accordance with the TSX's normal course issuer bid rules, including that such purchases were to be made at prevailing market prices or as otherwise permitted. Under the rules of the TSX, the maximum number of Common Shares that could have been

purchased in this period was 13,643,472 (representing 5% of the Company’s issued and outstanding Common Shares as of April 26, 2024), and the maximum number of Common Shares that could be purchased on a single day was 138,175 Common Shares, which was 25% of 552,700 (the average daily trading volume for the Common Shares on the TSX for the six months ended March 31, 2024), subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, and subject in any case to the volume and other limitations under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act.
On July 31, 2024, the Company voluntarily terminated the Fiscal 2024 NCIB and established a new normal course issuer bid (the Fiscal 2025 NCIB) in order to provide it with a means to execute purchases over the TSX as part of the overall Fiscal 2025 Repurchase Plan. The TSX approved the Company’s notice of intention to commence the Fiscal 2025 NCIB, pursuant to which the Company could purchase Common Shares over the TSX for the period commencing on August 7, 2024 until August 6, 2025 in accordance with the TSX's normal course issuer bid rules, including that such purchases were to be made at prevailing market prices or as otherwise permitted. Under the rules of the TSX, the maximum number of Common Shares that could have been purchased in this period was 21,179,064 (representing 10% of the Company’s public float (calculated in accordance with TSX rules) as of July 24, 2024, less the 5,073,913 Common Shares purchased under the Fiscal 2024 Repurchase Plan), and the maximum number of Common Shares that could have been purchased on a single day was 138,175 Common Shares, which was 25% of 552,700 (the average daily trading volume for the Common Shares on the TSX for the six months ended March 31, 2024), subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, and subject in any case to the volume and other limitations under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act.
On August 6, 2025, the Company renewed its normal course issuer bid (the "NCIB") in order to provide it with a means to execute purchases over the TSX as part of the overall Fiscal 2026 Repurchase Plan.
The TSX approved the Company’s notice of intention to commence the Fiscal 2026 NCIB, pursuant to which the
Company may purchase Common Shares over the TSX for the period commencing on August 12, 2025 until August 11, 2026 in accordance with the TSX's normal course issuer bid rules, including that such purchases be made at prevailing market prices or as otherwise permitted. Under the rules of the TSX, the maximum number of Common Shares that may be purchased in this period is 24,906,456 (representing 10% of the Company’s public float calculated in accordance with TSX rules) as of July 31, 2025, and the maximum number of Common Shares that can be purchased on a single day is 224,146 Common Shares, which was 25% of 896,585 (calculated in accordance with TSX rules based on the average daily trading volume for the Common Shares on the TSX for the six months ended July 31, 2025), subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, and subject in any case to the volume and other limitations under Rule 10b-18.
Further, as part of the NCIB renewal, the Company has established an ASPP with its broker to facilitate repurchases of the Common Shares.
Pensions
As of June 30, 2025, our total unfunded pension plan obligations were $136.9 million, of which $4.7 million is payable within the next twelve months. We expect to be able to make the long-term and short-term payments related to these obligations in the normal course of operations.

Guarantees and Indemnifications
We have entered into customer agreements which may include provisions to indemnify our customers against third-party claims that our software products or services infringe certain third-party intellectual property rights and for liabilities related to a breach of our confidentiality obligations. We have not made any material payments in relation to such indemnification provisions and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnification provisions in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Occasionally, we enter into financial guarantees with third parties in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, guarantees relating to taxes and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
Litigation
We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings.
Quarterly, we review the status of each significant legal matter and evaluate such matters to determine how they should be treated for accounting and disclosure purposes in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 450-20 “Loss Contingencies” (Topic 450-20). Specifically, this evaluation process includes the centralized tracking and itemization of the status of all our disputes and litigation items, discussing the nature of any litigation and claim, including any dispute or claim that is reasonably likely to result in litigation, with relevant internal and external counsel, and assessing the progress of each matter in light of its merits and our experience with similar proceedings under similar circumstances.
If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with Topic 450-20. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the aggregate of such accrued liabilities was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations and we do not believe as of the date of this filing that it is reasonably possible that a loss exceeding the amounts already recognized will be incurred that would be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. As described more fully below, we are unable at this time to estimate a possible loss or range of losses in respect of certain disclosed matters.
Contingencies
CRA Matter
As part of its ongoing audit of our Canadian tax returns, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has disputed our transfer pricing methodology used for certain intercompany transactions with our international subsidiaries and has issued notices of reassessment for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016. Assuming the utilization of available tax attributes (further described below), we estimate our potential aggregate liability, as of June 30, 2025, in connection with the CRA’s reassessments for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, to be limited to penalties, interest

and provincial taxes that may be due of approximately $86 million. As of June 30, 2025, we have provisionally paid approximately $32 million in order to fully preserve our rights to object to the CRA’s audit positions, being the minimum payment required under Canadian legislation while the matter is in dispute. This amount is recorded within Long-term income taxes recoverable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2025.
The notices of reassessment for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 would, as drafted, increase our taxable income by approximately $90 million to $100 million for each of those years, as well as impose a 10% penalty on the proposed adjustment to income. Audits by the CRA of our tax returns for fiscal years prior to Fiscal 2012 have been completed with no reassessment of our income tax liability.
We strongly disagree with the CRA's positions and believe the reassessments of Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 (including any penalties) are without merit, and we are continuing to contest these reassessments. On June 30, 2022, we filed a notice of appeal with the Tax Court of Canada seeking to reverse all such reassessments (including penalties) in full and the customary court process is ongoing.
Even if we are unsuccessful in challenging the CRA's reassessments to increase our taxable income for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, we have elective deductions available for those years (including carry-backs from later years) that would offset such increased amounts so that no additional cash tax would be payable, exclusive of any assessed penalties and interest, as described above.
The CRA has audited Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2020 on a basis that we strongly disagree with and are contesting. The focus of the CRA audit has been the valuation of certain intellectual property and goodwill when one of our subsidiaries continued into Canada from Luxembourg in July 2016. In accordance with applicable rules, these assets were recognized for tax purposes at fair market value as of that time, which value was supported by an expert valuation prepared by an independent leading accounting and advisory firm. CRA’s position for Fiscal 2017 through Fiscal 2020 relies in significant part on the application of its positions regarding our transfer pricing methodology that are the basis for its reassessment of our fiscal years 2012 to 2016 described above, and that we believe are without merit. Other aspects of CRA’s position for Fiscal 2017 through Fiscal 2020 conflict with the expert valuation prepared by the independent leading accounting and advisory firm that was used to support our original filing position. The CRA issued notices of reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 through Fiscal 2020 on a basis consistent with its proposal to reduce the available depreciable basis of assets in Canada. We have filed notices of objection to the reassessments for each of these years. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position, the estimated impact of the proposed adjustment could result in us recording an income tax expense, with no immediate cash payment, to reduce the stated value of our deferred tax assets of up to approximately $470 million. Any such income tax expense could also have a corresponding cash tax impact that would primarily occur over a period of several future years based upon annual income realization in Canada. We strongly disagree with the CRA’s position for Fiscal 2017 through Fiscal 2020 and intend to vigorously defend our original filing position. We are not required to provisionally pay any cash amounts to the CRA as a result of the reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 through Fiscal 2019 due to utilization of available tax attributes; however, for Fiscal 2020 and, to the extent the CRA reassesses subsequent fiscal years on a similar basis, we may be required to make certain minimum payments required under Canadian legislation on a provisional basis while the matter remains in dispute.
We will continue to vigorously contest the adjustments to our taxable income and any penalty and interest assessments, as well as any reduction to the basis of our depreciable property. We are confident that our original tax filing positions were appropriate. Accordingly, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not recorded any accruals in respect of these reassessments or proposed reassessment in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Other Matters
Also see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2025, as well as Note 15 “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K related to certain historical matters arising prior to the Micro Focus Acquisition.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
We do not enter into off-balance sheet financing as a matter of practice, except for guarantees relating to taxes and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company provides certain financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP (Non-GAAP). These Non-GAAP financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not have a standardized meaning and thus the Company’s definition may be different from similar Non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and/or analysts and may differ from period to period. Thus, it may be more difficult to compare the Company’s financial performance to that of other companies. However, the Company’s management compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of the items excluded in the calculation of these Non-GAAP financial measures both in its reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP financial measures and its Consolidated Financial Statements, all of which should be considered when evaluating the Company’s results. 
The Company uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to supplement the information provided in its Consolidated Financial Statements, which are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The presentation of Non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be a substitute for financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but rather should be evaluated in conjunction with and as a supplement to such U.S. GAAP measures. OpenText strongly encourages investors to review its financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure. The Company therefore believes that despite these limitations, it is appropriate to supplement the disclosure of the U.S. GAAP measures with certain Non-GAAP measures defined below.
Non-GAAP-based net income and Non-GAAP-based EPS, attributable to OpenText, are consistently calculated as GAAP-based net income or earnings (loss) per share, attributable to OpenText, on a diluted basis, excluding the effects of the amortization of acquired intangible assets, other income (expense), share-based compensation, and special charges (recoveries), all net of tax and any tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income, as further described in the tables below. Non-GAAP-based gross profit is the arithmetical sum of GAAP-based gross profit and the amortization of acquired technology-based intangible assets and share-based compensation within cost of sales. Non-GAAP-based gross margin is calculated as Non-GAAP-based gross profit expressed as a percentage of total revenue. Non-GAAP-based income from operations is calculated as GAAP-based income from operations, excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets, special charges (recoveries), and share-based compensation expense. 
Adjusted EBITDA is defined and calculated as GAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText, excluding interest income (expense), provision for (recovery of) income taxes, depreciation and amortization of acquired intangible assets, other income (expense), share-based compensation and special charges (recoveries). Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated as adjusted EBITDA expressed as a percentage of total revenue. 
Free cash flows is defined and calculated as GAAP-based cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.
The Company’s management believes that the presentation of the above defined Non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors because they portray the financial results of the Company before the impact of certain non-operational charges. The use of the term “non-operational charge” is defined for this purpose as an expense that does not impact the ongoing operating decisions taken by the Company’s management. These items are excluded based upon the way the Company’s management evaluates the performance of the Company’s business for use in the Company’s internal reports and are not excluded in the sense that they may be used under U.S. GAAP. 
The Company does not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and therefore believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures, which in certain cases adjust for the impact of amortization of intangible assets and the related tax effects that are primarily related to acquisitions, will provide readers of financial statements with a more consistent basis for comparison across accounting periods and be more useful in helping readers understand the Company’s operating results and underlying operational trends. Additionally, the Company has engaged in various restructuring activities over the past several years, primarily due to acquisitions and most recently in response to our return to office planning, that have resulted in costs associated with reductions in headcount, consolidation of leased facilities and related costs, all which are recorded under the Company’s Special charges (recoveries) caption on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Each restructuring activity is a discrete event based on a unique set of business objectives or circumstances, and each differs in terms of its operational implementation, business impact and scope, and the size of each restructuring plan can vary significantly from period to period. Therefore, the Company believes that the exclusion of these special charges (recoveries) will also better aid readers of financial statements in the understanding and comparability of the Company’s operating results and underlying operational trends. 
In summary, the Company believes the provision of supplemental Non-GAAP measures allow investors to evaluate the operational and financial performance of the Company’s core business using the same evaluation measures that management uses, and is therefore a useful indication of OpenText’s performance or expected performance of future operations and facilitates period-to-period comparison of operating performance (although prior performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance). As a result, the Company considers it appropriate and reasonable to provide, in addition to U.S. GAAP measures, supplementary Non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items from the presentation of its financial results.

Adjustment relates to the exclusion of amortization expense from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as the timing and frequency of amortization expense is dependent on our acquisitions and is hence excluded from our internal analysis of operating results.

Adjustment relates to the exclusion of special charges (recoveries) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as special charges (recoveries) are generally incurred in the periods relevant to an acquisition and include certain charges or recoveries that are not indicative or related to continuing operations and are therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results. See Note 18 “Special Charges (Recoveries)” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.

Adjustment relates to the exclusion of other income (expense) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as other income (expense) generally relates to the transactional impact of foreign exchange and is generally not indicative or related to continuing operations and is therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results. Other income (expense) also includes our share of income (losses) from our holdings in investments as a limited partner. We do not actively trade equity securities in these privately held companies nor do we plan our ongoing operations based around any anticipated fundings or distributions from these investments. We exclude gains and losses on these investments as we do not believe they are reflective of our ongoing business and operating results. Other income (expense) also includes unrealized and realized gains (losses) on our derivatives which are not designated as hedges. We exclude gains and losses on these derivatives as we do not believe they are reflective of our ongoing business and operating results.

Adjustment relates to differences between the GAAP-based tax provision rate of approximately 10% and a Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 24%; these rate differences are due to the income tax effects of items that are excluded for the purpose of calculating Non-GAAP-based net income. Such excluded items include amortization, share-based compensation, special charges (recoveries) and other income (expense), net. Also excluded are tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income such as changes in reserves for tax uncertainties and valuation allowance reserves and “book to return” adjustments for tax return filings and tax assessments. Beginning in Fiscal 2025, net tax benefits arising from the internal reorganization that occurred in Fiscal 2017 have been fully utilized and are no longer included. In arriving at our Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 24%, we analyzed the individual adjusted expenses and took into consideration the impact of statutory tax rates from local jurisdictions incurring the expense.

Adjustment relates to the exclusion of other income (expense) from our Non-GAAP-based operating expenses as other income (expense) generally relates to the transactional impact of foreign exchange and is generally not indicative or related to continuing operations and is therefore excluded from our internal analysis of operating results. Other income (expense) also includes our share of income (losses) from our holdings in investments as a limited partner. We do not actively trade equity securities in these privately held companies nor do we plan our ongoing operations based around any anticipated fundings or distributions from these investments. We exclude gains and losses on these investments as we do not believe they are reflective of our ongoing business and operating results. Other income (expense) also includes unrealized and realized gains (losses) on our derivatives which are not designated as hedges. We exclude gains and losses on these derivatives as we do not believe they are reflective of our ongoing business and operating results.
(7)
Adjustment relates to differences between the GAAP-based tax provision rate of approximately 36% and a Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%; these rate differences are due to the income tax effects of items that are excluded for the purpose of calculating Non-GAAP-based net income. Such excluded items include amortization, share-based compensation, special charges (recoveries) and other income (expense), net. Also excluded are tax benefits/expense items unrelated to current period income such as changes in reserves for tax uncertainties and valuation allowance reserves and “book to return” adjustments for tax return filings and tax assessments. Included is the amount of net tax benefits arising from the internal reorganization that occurred in Fiscal 2017 assumed to be allocable to the current period based on the forecasted utilization period. In arriving at our Non-GAAP-based tax rate of approximately 14%, we analyzed the individual adjusted expenses and took into consideration the impact of statutory tax rates from local jurisdictions incurring the expense.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are primarily exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates on our term loans, revolving loans and foreign currency exchange rates.
Interest rate risk
Our exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to our Revolver and Acquisition Term Loan. 
As of June 30, 2025, we had no outstanding balance under the Revolver. Borrowings under the Revolver bear interest per annum at a floating rate of interest equal to Term SOFR (as defined in the Revolver) and a fixed margin dependent on our consolidated net leverage ratio ranging from 1.25% to 1.75%. As of June 30, 2025, with no outstanding balance on the Revolver, an adverse change of 100 basis points on the interest rate would have no effect on our annual interest payment (June 30, 2024—nil).
85
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
As of June 30, 2025, we had an outstanding balance of $2.2 billion under the Acquisition Term Loan. Borrowings under the Acquisition Term Loan currently bear a floating rate of interest equal to Term SOFR plus the SOFR Adjustment (as defined in the Acquisition Term Loan) and applicable margin of 1.75%. As of June 30, 2025, an adverse change of 100 basis points on the interest rate would have the effect of increasing our annual interest payment on the Acquisition Term Loan by approximately $21.9 million, assuming that the loan balance as of June 30, 2025 is outstanding for the entire period (June 30, 2024—$22.2 million).
Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency transaction risk
We transact business in various foreign currencies. Our foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany fees, intercompany loans and other intercompany transactions that are expected to be cash settled in the near term and are transacted in non-functional currency. We expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to our foreign currency exposures. Our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to foreign currency exposures will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency transactions that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates. We have hedged certain of our Canadian dollar foreign currency exposures relating to our payroll expenses in Canada.
Based on the Canadian dollar foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of June 30, 2025, a one cent change in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate would have caused a change of $0.7 million in the mark-to-market valuation on our existing foreign exchange forward contracts (June 30, 2024—$0.7 million).
Additionally, in connection with the Micro Focus Acquisition, in August 2022, we entered into certain derivative transactions to meet certain foreign currency obligations related to the purchase price of the Micro Focus Acquisition, mitigate the risk of foreign currency appreciation in the GBP denominated purchase price and mitigate the risk of foreign currency appreciation in the EUR denominated existing debt held by Micro Focus. We entered into the following derivatives: (i) three deal-contingent forward contracts, (ii) a non-contingent forward contract, and (iii) EUR/USD cross currency swaps. In connection with the closing of the Micro Focus Acquisition the deal-contingent forward and non-deal contingent forward contracts were settled and we designated the 7-year EUR/USD cross currency swaps as net investment hedges.
Based on the 5-year EUR/USD cross currency swaps outstanding as of June 30, 2025, a one cent change in the Euro to U.S. dollar forward exchange rate would have caused a change of $5.9 million in the mark-to-market valuation on our existing cross currency swap (June 30, 2024—$7.2 million).
Based on the 7-year EUR/USD cross currency swaps outstanding as of June 30, 2025, a one cent change in the Euro to U.S. dollar forward exchange rate would have caused a change of $7.7 million in the mark-to-market valuation on our existing cross currency swaps (June 30, 2024—$7.6 million).
Foreign currency translation risk
Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. dollars. In particular, the amount of cash and cash equivalents that we report in U.S. dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period (the offset to which is recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on our Consolidated Balance Sheets). 
The following table shows our cash and cash equivalents denominated in certain major foreign currencies as of June 30, 2025 (equivalent in U.S. dollar):

If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10%, the amount of cash and cash equivalents we would report in equivalent U.S. dollars would decrease by $72.0 million (June 30, 2024—$52.2 million), assuming we have not entered into any derivatives discussed above under “Foreign Currency Transaction Risk.”
Item 8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
The response to this Item 8 is submitted as a separate section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Part IV, Item 15.
Item 9.  Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures
(A) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of June 30, 2025, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act were recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file under the Exchange Act (according to Rule 13(a)-15(e)) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
(B) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (ICFR), as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). ICFR is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. ICFR includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorizations of our management and our directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
Our management assessed our ICFR as of June 30, 2025, the end of our most recent fiscal year. In making our assessment, our management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Based on the results of our evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our ICFR was effective as of June 30, 2025. The results of our management’s assessment were reviewed with our Audit Committee and the conclusion that our ICFR was effective as of June 30, 2025 has been audited by KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report.
Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls or our ICFR will prevent or detect all error or all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in

achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Any evaluation of prospective control effectiveness, with respect to future periods, is subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
(C) Attestation Report of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued a report under Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standards AS 2201 on the effectiveness of our ICFR. See Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(D) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting (ICFR)
Based on the evaluation completed by our management, in which our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer participated, our management has concluded that there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings
None of our directors or executive officers have been involved in any events during the past ten years that would require disclosure under Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K. 
Audit Committee

The responsibilities, mandate and operation of the Audit Committee are set out in the Audit Committee Charter, a copy of which is available on the Company’s website, 
investors.opentext.com
 under the Corporate Governance section.
The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Fowlie qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as such term is defined in SEC Regulation S-K, Item 407(d)(5)(ii).
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
We have an Ethics Code that applies to all of our directors, officers and employees.

Board Diversity and Term Limits
The Company, including the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, views diversity in a broad context and considers a variety of factors when assessing nominees for the Board. The Company has established a policy recognizing that a Board made up of highly qualified directors from diverse backgrounds, including diversity of gender, age, race, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity and geographic representation, is important. 
In reference to the disclosure requirements under the CBCA, the Company has not adopted a written policy that specifically relates to the identification and nomination of women, aboriginal peoples in Canada, persons with disabilities and members of visible minorities (collectively, the Designated Groups) for election as directors. Pursuant to the requirements of the CBCA, the Company considers broader categories of diversity beyond those of the Designated Groups but which encompass the Designated Groups and which the Board of Directors considers to be better aligned to achieve the range of perspectives, experience and expertise required by the Company. For each of the four Designated Groups, the Company has not established a specific target number or percentage, nor a specific target date by which to achieve a specific target number or percentage of members of each Designated Groups on the Board, as we consider a multitude of factors, including skills, experience, expertise, character and the Company’s objective and challenges at the time in determining the best nominee at such time. In accordance with the CBCA disclosure requirements, as of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there are four women on the Board which represents approximately 33% of the Board, and 40% of the independent Board members. One director self-identified to the Company as a person with disabilities. One director has self-identified as a visible minority. No director has identified as a member of aboriginal peoples in Canada. 
The Company has not set term limits for independent directors because it values the cumulative experience and comprehensive knowledge of the Company that long-serving directors possess. The Company does not have a director retirement policy, however, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considers the results of its director assessment process in determining the nominees to be put forward. In conducting director evaluations and nominations, the

Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considers the composition of the Board and whether there is a need to include nominees with different skills, experiences and perspectives on the Board. This flexible approach allows the Company to consider each director individually as well as the Board composition generally to determine if the appropriate balance is being achieved. The onboarding of five new directors over the past six years demonstrates the Company’s focus on this approach.
Diversity in Executive Officer Positions 
The Company is committed to an inclusive culture and values that enable everyone to thrive and bring different perspectives to making software, and that fuels our goal to be the best Information Management company in the world. Governed by our published values, the Company communicates our commitment to fostering a merit-based inclusive workplace for all employees, regardless of culture, national origin, race, color, gender, gender identification, sexual orientation, family status, age, veteran status, disability, or religion, or other basis. We will continue to develop a sustainable business and customer-first culture, with a focus on inclusion, that provides all employees with an opportunity to excel. The Company has not adopted a written policy that specifically relates to the identification and nomination of women, aboriginal peoples in Canada, persons with disabilities and members of visible minorities (collectively, the Designated Groups) for appointment to executive officer positions. At the executive officer level, we consider a multitude of factors, including skills, experience across our global footprint at scale, expertise, and the Company’s objectives and challenges at the time in determining the best appointment at such time. Given the robust approach we take to sourcing broadly for executive talent, and our focus on our detailed approach to ensuring a wide range of experiences and qualifications, we do not currently have specific targets for Designated Groups. We believe that our approach will ensure a diverse talent pool. As of June 30, 2025, the Company has two women as executive officers as part of the executive leadership team (ELT) (18%), while approximately 21% of existing positions on the senior leadership team (SLT), exclusive of our ELT, are held by women. 18% of ELT and SLT members are based outside of North America. Within North America, 23% of the ELT and SLT members are visible minorities.
Insider Trading Policies and Procedures
We have adopted an Insider Trading Policy governing the purchase, sale, and/or other dispositions of the Company's securities by directors, officers and employees that are reasonably designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rules and regulations, and any listing standards applicable to the Company. A copy of our policies and procedures is filed as Exhibit 19.1 to this report.

Item 11.  Executive Compensation 
TALENT AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
Our Talent and Compensation Committee of Open Text’s Board (the Talent and Compensation Committee) has reviewed and discussed with our management the following Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A). Based on this review and discussion, our Talent and Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board that the following CD&A be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2025.
This report is provided by the following independent directors, who comprise our Talent and Compensation Committee:
David Fraser, Goldy Hyder and Annette Rippert.
To the extent that this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been or will be specifically incorporated by reference into any filing by us under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, this “Talent and Compensation Committee Report” shall not be deemed “soliciting materials”, unless specifically otherwise provided in any such filing.
LETTER FROM OUR TALENT AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE 
Dear Shareholders,
The Talent and Compensation Committee’s most critical responsibility is ensuring that our executive compensation program attracts, hires, retains and motivates the best talent in the technology industry while aligning to your interests and directly responding to your concerns. The 2024 Say-on-Pay vote was deeply reviewed and considered. We are not just listening—we are taking clear actions.
Engaging with our shareholders is a core priority. Over the past years, we have conducted extensive outreach regarding our executive compensation program, and these efforts intensified throughout Fiscal 2024. Following the 2024 annual general meeting of shareholders (AGM), we launched an engagement initiative focused specifically on compensation, implementing changes in direct response to the feedback. 
In March 2025, our independent Board members met with six large institutional investors (representing 20% of our shares) to discuss our compensation program - on top of our regular touchpoints with these investors. In addition to these meetings, we also engaged governance representatives of our top 25 largest shareholders. These meetings included participation from key senior executives, including our Chief Human Resources Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary, to cover executive compensation and other important governance topics. In total, we extended invitations to holders of over 55% of our shares and ultimately met with shareholders representing 40% of our total shares outstanding to discuss executive compensation, in addition to our regular investor touchpoints.
Throughout the year, we met with certain shareholders as many as six times, reflecting the depth of our commitment to understanding and addressing investor concerns, and we remain committed to continuing this outreach beyond the 2025 AGM. We also considered prior published reports from proxy advisory firms to understand their perspectives on specific elements of our compensation program and to appropriately incorporate their views into our ongoing enhancements.
Following intensive engagement and internal reviews, we engaged a new independent Talent and Compensation Committee compensation consultant, Meridian Compensation Partners (Meridian), to provide a fresh perspective to further align our pay practices with best-in-class governance standards and shareholder expectations. Meridian’s mandate, as a fully independent consultant to the Talent and Compensation Committee, has been to reevaluate our compensation program against market and best industry practices, and recommend changes.

We are acting on what we heard
. After a thorough analysis of your feedback, in close consultation with Meridian and the new members of the Talent and Compensation Committee, and with support from our CEO, we have redesigned the compensation program for our executive officers by implementing significant and meaningful changes to our Fiscal 2026 program, including:
•
New Peer Group
:
 We received feedback from our shareholders that, while the industry and revenue alignment of our peer group was strong, there were concerns that too many of our peers were too large, in market capitalization terms, compared to OpenText. We updated our peer group, replacing eight peer group companies with six new peers, to better match our market capitalization, global reach, revenue parameters and operational complexity, and to reflect whom we compete against (see Section V – Compensation Peer Group for more information on our new peer group and our benchmarking analysis).
•
Commitment to Predictable and Transparent LTIP Awards
:
 We have reaffirmed our commitment to delivering long-term incentive (LTI) awards exclusively through our annual long-term incentive plan (LTIP) programs. We did not issue any one-time awards in Fiscal 2025 and are committed to maintaining this approach going forward to ensure consistency and alignment with shareholder expectations.
•
Strengthening Pay-for-Performance Alignment
:
 We also made several changes to our compensation design to strengthen our pay-for-performance alignment for Fiscal 2026, including:
◦
Cap on PSU Payouts for Negative TSR:
 We introduced a cap on PSU payouts at 100% of target if absolute total shareholder return (TSR) is negative over the PSU performance period, even if we outperform our peer index. This cap is in addition to our increased target performance goal introduced in Fiscal 2025

requiring relative TSR overperformance versus the NASDAQ Composite Index (from the 50th percentile to the 55th percentile) in order to achieve a payout.
◦
Higher Performance Thresholds for STI Payouts:
 We adjusted the payout curves under the short-term incentive (STI) plan, increasing the minimum performance threshold from 90% of target attainment, to 95%, to achieve any payout, as well as reducing payouts for all levels of financial performance below target (as described further in Section VI – Elements of Our Compensation Program). We also increased the level of Adjusted Operating Income (AOI) attainment to qualify for maximum payouts to 104% of target, consistent with the performance/payout curve for the revenue metric under the STI plan. 
◦
Elimination of Stock Options for Annual LTIP:
 Our CEO’s and NEO’s annual LTIP grant package will no longer include stock options. Rather, we are emphasizing a mix of performance-based equity vehicles, including 100% of the CEO’s annual LTIP grant being in the form of Performance Share Units (PSUs).
◦
Increased Share Ownership Guidelines: 
To further strengthen alignment between executive interests and those of our shareholders, we doubled the equity ownership requirements for senior management to 2x base salary beginning in Fiscal 2026. For our CEO, his ownership requirement will remain at 6x base salary, a level that already exceeds the average guideline requirement of our peer group.
•
Reduced CEO Pay
:
 For Fiscal 2026, our CEO’s target value of equity grants under the LTIP will be lower than the grants made for Fiscal 2025. Overall, together with our CEO, we made the determination to reduce the CEO’s compensation by $500,000 and his target total compensation sits below the 25
th
 percentile compared to our new peer group.
Talent and Compensation Committee Chair:
 While we did not appoint a permanent Chair of the Talent and Compensation Committee in Fiscal 2025, we actively recruited for a new Board member with extensive experience in executive compensation. To facilitate our Fiscal 2025 committee meetings, the chair position was rotated among our highly experienced Talent and Compensation Committee members, all of whom have joined the Talent and Compensation Committee within the past three fiscal years.
Board Refreshment:
 To ensure our Board composition continues to reflect the evolving needs of the Company and incorporates fresh perspectives, we have appointed four new members over the past two years: Goldy Hyder, Annette Rippert, Fletcher Previn and, most recently, Kristen Ludgate. These new directors have bolstered the Board’s expertise in areas of public and international policy, information technology, strategy, executive compensation, communications and finance, and two of these new members, Mr. Hyder and Ms. Rippert, joined the Talent and Compensation Committee in Fiscal 2025. See Item 10 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2025 for further information on our Board members.

Key Executive Leadership Changes:
 In line with our Talent and Compensation philosophy, over the past three fiscal years, the Board has appointed several key executives with extensive global technology company and industry experience, reflecting the external market for top executive talent. These leaders bring valuable expertise and leadership experience to help accelerate our strategic priorities. These appointments, including Todd Cione (President Worldwide Sales), Paul Duggan (President, Chief Customer Officer), Savinay Berry (Chief Product Officer), Sandy Ono (Chief Marketing Officer), and Shannon Bell (Chief Digital Officer), are expected to enhance our ability to scale execution across key areas of information management and drive our AI-first agenda.
Engagement with our shareholders is not a one-time effort, it is a fundamental, ongoing commitment. We will continue to engage, listen, and take action to ensure our compensation practices align with your expectations. Your voice is not just valued, it is driving real change. We are committed to earning your confidence through transparency, accountability, and results.
Sincerely,
The Talent and Compensation Committee

Section I - Our Shareholder Engagement Process and Response to Say-on-Pay Vote
Shareholder Engagement Overview and Timeline
We take shareholder feedback very seriously and view the 2024 Say-on-Pay vote outcome as a clear and important signal that further revisions to our executive compensation program were required. In response, we undertook a comprehensive review of our compensation program, informed by extensive shareholder outreach and guidance from our newly appointed independent compensation consultant.
Below is a timeline of the shareholder engagement and key governance updates leading up to and following our 2024 AGM and say-on-pay vote.
Key Themes from Shareholder Engagement and Actions Taken 
The feedback and perspectives that we received in meetings with shareholders leading up to and after the 2024 AGM provided us with valuable and direct insight on our executive compensation program. Throughout the engagement meetings, we heard a range of diverse shareholder perspectives.
A number of key themes stood out as the main reasons shareholders did not support our 2024 Say-On-Pay proposal. The common themes among our shareholders included:
1.
the level of CEO pay and supplemental off-cycle award grants to our CEO;
2.
the STI payout structure for below target achievement;
3.
the desire for even greater alignment of executive compensation with shareholder experience; and
4.
the composition of our peer group, particularly with respect to the size and scale of certain peer companies used.

Shareholders also asked questions about, and provided their perspectives on, other topics including STI/LTI plans metrics and board refreshment. 
The table below summarizes key feedback themes from our s
hare
holders obtained following the 2024 AGM and our responsive actions and perspectives for Fiscal 2026.
What We Heard - Key Themes
What We Did - Our Perspectives and Actions
Some shareholders had concerns regarding the level of Fiscal 2024 CEO pay, CEO LTIP structure and historical one-time CEO incentive awards 
Transition to 100% Performance-Based LTIP:
 Beginning in Fiscal 2026, the CEO’s LTIP grants will be comprised entirely of PSUs, making the vesting of the full award performance-based and fully at risk.
One-Time Grants:
 We adhered to our commitment in Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2025 and committed going forward that there would not be any one-time long-term incentive awards granted to our CEO, as well as other existing executives.
Reduction in Target Compensation: 
For Fiscal 2026, in partnership with our CEO, we also reduced our CEO’s total target compensation by $500,000 (a 5% decrease) by lowering the target value of the LTIP award. Following this adjustment, the CEO’s target total compensation is now positioned below the 25th percentile of our updated peer group, demonstrating our commitment to shareholder alignment and responsible pay governance. 
Shareholders suggested reviewing the performance leverage required to earn threshold and maximum payout under our STI program
In alignment with practices at our new peer group, we have strengthened our STI program for Fiscal 2026 by increasing the performance standards required to earn payouts, aligning the plan more closely with market best practices and our pay-for-performance philosophy.
Higher Thresholds, Lower Payouts:
 In Fiscal 2025, performance at 90% of target resulted in a 40% threshold payout. For Fiscal 2026, we have increased the minimum performance threshold to 95% of target and lowered the corresponding payout to 25%. These revised payout curves apply to both Revenue and AOI metrics.
More Rigorous Maximum Payout Criteria:
 To earn the maximum STI payout of 200% of target in Fiscal 2026, performance must reach at least 104% of target for both Revenue and AOI. This represents a stricter requirement than in Fiscal 2025, when just the AOI metric required 103% performance to achieve maximum payout.
The revised STI payout structure for Fiscal 2026 is designed to deliver lower payouts for below-target performance and require higher performance to achieve maximum payouts. The changes strengthen the link between pay and performance by increasing the incentive to drive meaningful revenue and AOI growth. At the same time, it introduces more stringent consequences for underperformance, resulting in a more rigorous framework than that used in Fiscal 2025. This builds on the simplification of STI metrics in Fiscal 2025, when, following the integration of the Micro Focus acquisition, we streamlined the STI program by removing Micro Focus revenue as a separate performance measure.
Further, for Fiscal 2026, to ensure alignment and consistency, our STI program for all executives, including our NEOs, will be based on Worldwide Revenues and AOI. Historically, certain of our Sales executives were measured on other metrics, including in part based on Cloud, Customer Support Revenue and Enterprise PS Bookings. By aligning to the same STI metrics, this will simplify our STI program and ensure all executives align to our strategic priorities, which include driving profitable organic growth across the business. See Section VI - Elements of Our Compensation Program for a description of the Worldwide Revenues and AOI metrics within our STI program.

Shareholders voiced concerns about current structure of annual LTIP award vehicle mix and requested even greater pay-for-performance alignment
Updated Annual LTIP Award Vehicle Mix:
 Beginning in Fiscal 2026, the annual LTIP awards for our NEOs (excluding the CEO) will be comprised exclusively of PSUs and RSUs, weighted at 55% and 45%, respectively. As discussed above, the CEO’s LTIP grants will be comprised entirely of PSUs. Stock options will no longer be included in the annual LTIP award vehicle mix. This shift increases the proportion of performance-based equity to a majority of the total annual LTIP award, underscoring our commitment to a robust pay-for-performance framework.
Introduction of Absolute TSR Modifier:
 In Fiscal 2025, in order to achieve target PSU payout, we required relative TSR to outperform the NASDAQ Composite Index at the 55th percentile, up from the 50th percentile. To further align executive pay with shareholder outcomes, we are also introducing an absolute TSR modifier to the PSU component, effective Fiscal 2026. Under this modifier, if the Company’s absolute TSR is negative over the performance period, the PSU payout will be capped at 100% target, even if relative TSR performance attainment would result in an above target payout otherwise, bringing pay outcomes into better alignment with the shareholder experience.
Some shareholders voiced concerns that our compensation peer group included companies that were not appropriately scaled to OpenText’s size 
New Compensation Peer Group: 
We received feedback that, while our peer group was well-aligned in terms of industry and revenue, concerns remained regarding the comparatively high average market capitalization of peer group companies. In response, we conducted a comprehensive review and replaced eight companies with six new peers (see Section V – Compensation Peer Group below for more information on our new peer group). The revised peer group more accurately reflects OpenText’s market capitalization (all new peers have market capitalizations that fall within a reasonable range relative to OpenText (.25x to 4x)), revenue profile, and operating complexity. This ensures a more appropriate benchmark for executive compensation and reinforces our commitment to shareholder alignment. Relative to the updated peer group:
•
OpenText revenues are 19% higher than the peer group median, placing us at the 61st percentile;
•
Employee headcount is at the 75
th
 percentile of the peer group median; and 
•
Market capitalization is positioned at the 22
nd
 percentile relative to the peer group.
Additional Executive Compensation Program Changes
In addition to the actions discussed above, we also adjusted our Share Ownership Guidelines for our executives as part of our comprehensive review of the program. To further strengthen alignment between executive interests and those of our shareholders, we are increasing the equity ownership guidelines for senior management (excluding the CEO) beginning in Fiscal 2026. For our NEOs (excluding the CEO), the updated guidelines will require these executives to hold equity equivalent to 2x their base salary, up from the previous 1x requirement. For our CEO, his ownership requirement will remain at 6x base salary, a level that already exceeds the average of our peer group. See Section VII - Other Elements of Our Compensation Program for a detailed discussion of our Share Ownership Guidelines.
Section II - Compensation Governance and Objectives
Role of the Talent and Compensation Committee
The Talent and Compensation Committee has responsibility for the oversight of executive compensation within the terms and conditions of our various compensation plans. The Talent and Compensation Committee approves the compensation of our executive officers, except for our CEO, where decisions are approved by the Board without the CEO present. Compensation decisions for our executive officers consider, among other things, performance goals, base salary, bonuses, executive benefits, short-term incentives, and long-term incentives. The Talent and Compensation Committee also reviews and recommends for 
103
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
approval all equity awards related to executive compensation prior to final approval by the Board and supports the Board with respect to talent and culture matters, including: succession and development of our executive officers; reviewing and discussing the progress of our workforce and global employee engagement initiatives; providing input on human capital disclosures; and reviewing our approach to retirement programs.
The Talent and Compensation Committee coordinates with the CEO and the Chief Human Resources Officer, in collaboration with management and the finance and legal groups, as appropriate, to design and develop the compensation program. This group supports the preparation and analysis of financial data, peer group comparisons, and other materials to assist the Talent and Compensation Committee in making and implementing its decisions. 
The Board, the Talent and Compensation Committee, and our management employ a set of policies and processes to evaluate the performance of each of our NEOs, which help determine the amount of long-term incentives to award to each NEO. The performance of each of our NEOs, other than our CEO, is assessed by our CEO in his capacity as the direct supervisor of the other NEOs. The performance of our CEO is assessed by the Board (excluding the CEO). The Board conducts discussions and makes decisions with respect to the performance of our CEO in special sessions from which management and the CEO are absent.
The CEO, with the assistance of the Chief Human Resources Officer, also conducts an annual review of the total compensation of each executive officer, including the NEOs. The review includes an assessment of each executive officer’s experience, performance, the performance of the executive officer’s respective business or function, and market pay levels against our peer group. After this review, the CEO recommends base salaries, annual target short-term incentive and long-term incentive opportunities, any payouts related to the annual short-term incentives, and annual equity grants for the executive officers to the Talent and Compensation Committee for approval.
The Talent and Compensation Committee considers previous compensation awards, competitive market practice, the impact of tax and accounting treatments, applicable regulatory requirements, any material acquisitions or divestitures closed during the year and the results of the most recent shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation when approving compensation programs. 
The Talent and Compensation Committee met five times during Fiscal 2025. Management assisted in the coordination and preparation of the meeting agenda and materials for each meeting. The agenda is reviewed and approved by the Chair of the Talent and Compensation Committee. The meeting materials are generally posted and made available to the other Talent and Compensation Committee members and invitees, if any, for review approximately one week in advance of each meeting. Following each meeting, the Talent and Compensation Committee reported items that it, in its determination, considered noteworthy to the Board.
Further, prior to setting executive compensation, the Talent and Compensation Committee considered internal pay equity to ensure that the pay of our executives (including the CEO’s pay relative to that of our other NEOs) is appropriate.
In Fiscal 2025, the Board did not appoint a permanent Chair of the Talent and Compensation Committee. To facilitate our Fiscal 2025 committee meetings, the chair position was rotated among our highly experienced Talent and Compensation Committee members, all of whom have joined the Talent and Compensation Committee within the past three fiscal years. Throughout Fiscal 2025, we actively recruited a new Board member with extensive experience in executive compensation, which resulted in the appointment of Kristen Ludgate to the Board on June 26, 2025.
Compensation Consultant

NASDAQ standards require compensation committees to have certain responsibilities and authority regarding the retention, oversight and funding of committees’ advisors and perform an evaluation of each advisor’s independence, taking into consideration all factors relevant to that person’s independence from management. Such standards also require that such rights and responsibilities be enumerated in the compensation committee’s charter. While, as a foreign private issuer under the U.S. federal securities laws, we are exempt from these rules, nonetheless, our Talent and Compensation Committee has the sole authority to retain and terminate outside consultants. The Talent and Compensation Committee seeks the advice of an outside compensation consultant to provide assistance and guidance on compensation issues. The compensation consultant may provide the Talent and Compensation Committee with relevant information pertaining to market compensation levels, alternative compensation plan designs, market trends and best practices and may assist the Talent and Compensation Committee with respect to determining the appropriate benchmarks for each NEO’s compensation.
In Fiscal 2025, the Talent and Compensation Committee appointed Meridian as its new compensation consultant, following an extensive search. This decision was made in response to prior Say-on-Pay vote outcomes and reflects our commitment to aligning executive compensation practices with leading governance standards and shareholder expectations. Meridian was engaged to provide independent advisory services and support for our executive compensation program. As part of their engagement, Meridian conducted a comprehensive review of our entire compensation framework, evaluating it against our compensation philosophy and strategic objectives. This review led to several enhancements, including the adoption of a 
104
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
revised peer group and improvements to our pay-for-performance alignment. Throughout Fiscal 2025, the members of the Talent and Compensation Committee met periodically with Meridian representatives to discuss market practices, evolving governance trends, and potential implications for the Company’s financial performance. Meridian also provided benchmarking data and guidance on CEO and executive officer compensation. For these services, Meridian received $71,000 in

fees during Fiscal 2025.
Talent and Compensation Committee Approach and Objectives
We believe that compensation plays an important role in achieving short and long-term business objectives that ultimately drive business success in alignment with long-term shareholder value creation. The Talent and Compensation Committee ensures compensation decisions are in line with our compensation philosophy to be talent competitive. Our compensation program objectives include:
•
Attracting, motivating and retaining

highly qualified executive officers who have a history of proven success through compensation programs that reflect the market.
 Our compensation program reflects the market in terms of compensation value and structural design. We use market data from similarly sized software and technology companies with a global presence for a variety of reasons, including that greater than 95% of our revenues are generated outside of Canada.
•
Aligning the interests of executive officers with our shareholders’ interests and with the execution of our business strategy, with the majority of the total compensation package tied to performance-based variable rewards.
 Evaluation of executive performance is based on achievement of key financial metrics that we believe closely correlate to long-term shareholder value. Our short and long-term goals are reflected in our overall compensation program with evaluations based on achieving and overachieving predetermined objectives. Our CEO’s total target compensation is comprised of: 
◦
8% from base salary; 
◦
12% from short-term incentives; and 
◦
80% in the form of annual equity grants. 
Other NEOs average 16% of their total compensation in the form of base salary with 84% tied to short term and long-term incentives.
Our approach to executive pay is guided by the following best practices:
What We Do
P
Balance short- and long-term incentives, cash and equity, and fixed and variable pay.
P
Link a significant amount of target NEO pay to Company performance (at least 80%).
P
Cap short-term incentive plans at 200% of target.
P
Use multiple types of equity awards to balance risk and reward.
P
Use distinct performance metrics in our short-term and long-term incentives.
P
Compare executive compensation and Company performance to relevant peer group companies, which are re-evaluated annually, and consider our industry scope, market for executive talent and geographic footprint.
P
Require significant executive stock ownership.
P
Allow unearned incentive pay to be recaptured under our Clawback Policy (defined below).
P
Provide only limited perquisites and no supplemental executive retirement plans.
P
Retain an independent compensation consultant.
P
Conduct an annual shareholder say-on-pay advisory vote.
P
Conduct regular and extensive engagement with our shareholders, including an initiative focused specifically on compensation.
P
Avoid guaranteed base salary increases or a minimum level of vesting for long-term incentives.
P
Refrain from paying discretionary bonuses.
P
Provide double-trigger change in control benefits to our NEOs.

Section III - Fiscal 2025 Highlights
In Fiscal

2025, we reinforced the critical role our products play across industries and demonstrated the strength and resilience of our business model in a dynamic global environment. We successfully launched our next generation cloud platform, Titanium X with AI (CE 25.2) and expanded our Business Optimization Plan, marking a significant milestone for the Company. Throughout the year, our team executed these initiatives with discipline and focus, driving cloud revenue growth, margin expansion and continued strong capital return to shareholders. We expect to realize additional benefits from these efforts in the years ahead.
Highlights and outcomes related to specific components of CEO and NEO compensation for Fiscal 2025 are as follows:
•
CEO Pay: 
The target value of our CEO’s annual compensation package, comprised of base salary, short-term incentive and long-term equity awards, decreased by 4.6% compared to Fiscal 2024.
◦
Base Salary
: Our CEO’s base salary remained unchanged for the seventh consecutive year.
◦
STI
: The CEO’s STI target was reduced by $590,000 in Fiscal 2025, which when combined with the rigorous goal setting for Fiscal 2025 resulted in a 24.3% decline in STI award payout year-over-year
.
◦
LTIP
: Our CEO’s annual LTIP target grant value remained flat year-over-year, with no change to the equity vehicle mix. 
◦
Internal Pay Equity
: The CEO-to-next-highest-paid NEO target compensation ratio decreased from 2.7x to 2.6x (-4%), reflecting added internal alignment. 
•
STI Program:
 Following the integration of the Micro Focus acquisition, we simplified our STI program by eliminating Micro Focus revenue as a separate performance measure for Fiscal 2025.
◦
STI plan measures focused on overall profitable growth across all lines of products. For most executives, including the CEO, STI plan measures were Worldwide Revenue and Adjusted Operating Income (AOI). 
◦
Removal from targets of the impact of the AMC Divestiture: on May 1, 2024, we successfully completed the sale of our Application Modernization and Connectivity (AMC) business to Rocket Software, Inc. for $2.275 billion in cash before taxes, fees and other adjustments (the AMC Divestiture).
▪
The decrease in Fiscal 2025 targets relative to Fiscal 2024 actual results is completely attributable to the AMC Divestiture, as the results from the AMC business through to April 30, 2024, were included in our Fiscal 2024 results but excluded from our Fiscal 2025 targets. 
▪
The Fiscal 2025 targets, which reflect only our ongoing product portfolio, represent a 1% growth in Worldwide Revenues compared to Fiscal 2024 results when AMC is excluded from the results, and represent a larger increase in the AOI target as the Company continues to focus on growing revenue and reducing costs. Therefore, the Fiscal 2025 targets for each metric were set greater than their respective 2024 achievements on an ongoing product portfolio basis.

AOI is also adjusted to remove the impact of foreign exchange.

In Fiscal 2025, we increased the recurring annual target grant values of LTIP awards for our NEOs (excluding the CEO) to ensure alignment with our compensation philosophy. As a result, the overall LTIP value for these NEOs is now positioned at or above the 25th percentile of our revised peer group.
◦
We maintained the use of relative Total Shareholder Return (rTSR) PSUs to reward long-term performance compared to similar investment alternatives.
▪
The performance period for the PSUs granted in Fiscal 2022 concluded in Fiscal 2025. Over this three-year period, the Company placed at the 35th percentile relative to the S&P Midcap 400 Software & Services Peer Group. This resulted in a 70% payout from the Fiscal 2022 grant.
▪
Beginning with the Fiscal 2024 grant cycle, rTSR PSUs are measured against the three-year TSR of the constituents of the NASDAQ Composite Index. This change was made to reflect the Company’s increased scale and broader market position following the Micro Focus acquisition, while also providing a more diversified and representative benchmark of shareholder investment alternatives. 
▪
For the Fiscal 2025 PSU grant, we increased the rTSR performance threshold required to achieve a target payout from the 50th percentile to the 55th percentile. This enhancement underscores our commitment to delivering above-median performance and creating greater value for shareholders. 
Section IV - Aligning Pay with Performance
Our CEO’s realizable pay aligns with the experience of shareholders of the Company and is directly correlated to TSR performance. The grant date value in the Summary Compensation Table (
see Section VII
) significantly overstates the CEO’s actual realized and realizable compensation after our actual performance is measured because the program aligns the final reward with actual performance and share price movement.

The table below also shows that the actual value (realizable) as of June 30, 2025, is considerably lower than the grant date fair value of stock and option awards as reported in the Summary Compensation Table. The actual value realizable by our CEO was 63% lower as of June 30, 2025, than the grant date fair value of stock and option awards reported in the Summary Compensation Table over the last three fiscal years. This provides a meaningful demonstration of the pay for performance alignment of the Company’s executive compensation program, and the actual value realizable shows the strong alignment of our CEO’s realizable pay with our share price performance and the experience of our shareholders.

As of June 30, 2025, all vested performance stock options are unexercised and out-of-the money.
Section V – Compensation Peer Group
Aggregate compensation for each NEO is designed to be market competitive. The Talent and Compensation Committee refers to the compensation practices of similarly situated companies in determining our compensation policy. Although the Talent and Compensation Committee reviews each element of compensation for market competitiveness and may weigh a 
108
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
particular element more heavily than another based on an NEO’s role within the Company, the focus remains on being competitive in the market with respect to total compensation.
We use an industry framework noted below, which aligns with the approach taken by proxy advisors, to identify companies that are comparable in size, have similar business strategies and financial models, recognizing that there are very few, if any direct peers that are based in Canada with named executive officers residing in the U.S., which is a key market for executive talent in the information technology industry. We apply the following screening process:
Quantitative Screen
We initially screen based on those companies within our Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) industry group, including those specifically classified under the Application Software sub-industry. From there, we identify companies that are reasonably similar to OpenText, filtering companies based on revenue and market capitalization (each within a range of 0.25 to 4 times our own). Following this initial quantitative screen, we will review additional factors such as total assets, net income, and number of employees to supplement our overall quantitative selection process.
Qualitative Screen
A qualitative screen is then conducted to ensure the selected companies are truly comparable. As part of this process, we focus on global companies operating in the technology industry, ensuring that in aggregate, we consider the appropriate mix of Canadian and U.S.-listed companies. We also consider companies that have been identified as a peer of one of our previous year’s peers, companies that use OpenText as a peer in their own disclosure, and peer groups published by proxy advisory firms, before finalizing the composition of our peer group.
The Talent and Compensation Committee generally benchmarks against software and technology companies with a global presence, rather than solely Canadian companies because:
•
We are a global software company with greater than 95% of our revenues generated outside of Canada, including 51% of our revenues in the U.S.; 
•
The highly competitive U.S. technology market is a key market for multi-national executive talent in the software and technology industry; and
•
For the full range of executive leadership roles at the Company, it is not feasible to solely source talent from Canadian software and technology companies, particularly for core business functions requiring technology sector expertise. 
The Talent and Compensation Committee recognizes that recruiting talent globally, including from the U.S., is critical for our success, even though executive compensation levels may be higher by comparison to levels in Canada. Attracting and retaining talent with the highest level of industry expertise is a key part of the Company’s business and strategy, and our compensation practices must align with market expectations where the industry skills reside. Further, the Talent and Compensation Committee also acknowledges that paying local market compensation in local currency may result in higher relative compensation compared to other Canadian companies that provide Canadian residents with Canadian dollars. Converting amounts paid to executives based outside of Canada to Canadian currency inflates the appearance of the compensation if compared to Canadian companies that pay Canadian residents in local currency.
2025 Compensation Peer Group

For Fiscal 2025, we conducted a review of our compensation peer group in collaboration with the Board and management’s compensation consultants. In response to the feedback received during Fiscal 2025 shareholder outreach regarding the concern that the Fiscal 2024 average peer group company’s market capitalization was too large, we removed several companies with market capitalization exceeding OpenText’s, even though they aligned on revenue metrics. They were replaced with companies that better fit within the targeted range.
The peer group used for benchmarking executive compensation was selected through a rigorous process that incorporated multiple inputs. This included alignment with proxy advisor frameworks, an independent review conducted by our external compensation consultant, Meridian, and thorough evaluation, review, and approval by the Talent and Compensation Committee. This approach ensures the peer group reflects relevant industry standards and supports informed compensation decisions.
As a result, for Fiscal 2025, all peer companies fall within the targeted range of 0.25x to 4x OpenText’s revenue and market capitalization. As a comparison amongst the peer group:

•

Section VI - Elements of Our Compensation Program
We use a combination of fixed and variable compensation to motivate our executive officers to achieve our corporate goals. The basic components of our executive officer compensation program are:
•
Base salary (fixed); 
•
Short-term cash incentives (variable); and
•
Long-term equity incentives (variable). 
To ensure alignment of the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our shareholders, our executive officers have a significant proportion of compensation that is variable or “at risk.” Compensation that is “at risk” means compensation that can vary on whether and how much is paid to an executive officer depending on whether the Company and such executive officer are able to meet or exceed applicable performance targets. Also, our short-term and long-term incentive compensation is subject to our Clawback Policy (see “Other Information with Respect to Our Compensation Program - Clawback Policy” below).
The Talent and Compensation Committee annually considers the percentage of each NEO’s total target compensation that is “at risk” depending on the NEO’s responsibilities and objectives.

The base salary review for each NEO considers factors such as current competitive market conditions and the individual’s particular skills (such as leadership ability and management effectiveness, experience, responsibility and proven or expected performance). In line with our commitment to “at risk” compensation and reflecting the interests of our shareholders, our CEO’s base salary remained unchanged for the seventh consecutive year.

Short-Term Incentives
In Fiscal 2025, all of our NEOs, with the exception of Mr. Westlake, participated in our STI plan, which is designed to motivate the achievement of our short-term corporate goals. Mr. Westlake joined the Company in March 2025. See below for the treatment of Mr. Westlake’s STI award for Fiscal 2025
.
These short-term corporate goals are derived from our annual business plan which is approved by the Board at the start of the fiscal year. Awards made under the STI plan are paid in cash only.
The executive STI plan for Fiscal 2025, which is applicable to all of our NEOs except Mr. Duggan, was based on Worldwide Revenues and AOI. Mr. Duggan’s STI plan for Fiscal 2025 is based on Cloud, Customer Support Revenue, Enterprise PS Bookings and AOI. However, as previously noted, for Fiscal 2026, to ensure alignment and consistency, our STI program for all executives, including Mr. Duggan, will be based on Worldwide Revenues and AOI.
In Fiscal 2025, we removed Micro Focus Revenue as an STI metric, which had been introduced in Fiscal 2023. This change reflects the successful integration of Micro Focus products into the broader OpenText portfolio; as a result, we no longer track Micro Focus revenues separately. The continued emphasis on revenue-focused metrics aligns with our strategic priorities, which include driving profitable organic growth and fully consolidating Micro Focus products within the OpenText platform.
For Fiscal 2025, the following table shows the target short-term award for each NEO, along with the associated weighting of the related performance measures for each (weightings are slightly different to reflect individual differences in accountability).

AOI is a non-GAAP measure intended to reflect the operational effectiveness of our leadership by showing our ability to generate profits from our operational activities, and to manage the costs associated with our worldwide revenues. AOI is calculated as total revenues less the total cost of revenues and operating expenses excluding amortization of intangible assets, special charges (recoveries) and stock-based compensation expense. AOI is also adjusted to remove the impact of foreign exchange.

The Fiscal 2025 target, which reflect only our ongoing product portfolio, represent a 1% growth in Worldwide Revenues compared to Fiscal 2024 results when AMC is excluded from the results, and represent a larger increase in the AOI target as the Company continues to focus on growing revenue and reducing costs. Therefore, the Fiscal 2025 targets for each metric were set greater than their respective 2024 achievements on an ongoing product portfolio basis.

Prior Sales executives were measured on metrics that were a subset of Worldwide Revenues. However, with the strategic appointment in Fiscal 2024 of Todd Cione as President of OpenText Worldwide Sales, the Worldwide Revenue metric (and not a subset of this metric) was considered more appropriate as Mr. Cione is focused on spearheading our global go-to-market strategy and revenue growth, with OpenText's global sales and sales operations functions reporting directly to him.

Mr. Westlake joined the Company in March 2025. As part of Mr. Westlake’s sign-on compensation arrangement, he was provided with an “at target” STI payment prorated for the duration he was employed during Fiscal 2025 (i.e., from March 2025 to June 2025) to ensure Mr. Westlake neither benefits from nor is penalized for performance metrics that would not have reflected Mr. Westlake’s contribution to the Company during the remainder of the fiscal year. As a result, Mr. Westlake’s “at target” payout in Fiscal 2025 was $189,191, based on his annual STI target of $585,210.

Ms. Ranganathan ceased to be our Chief Financial Officer in March 2025. As a result of her departure from the Company, she was provided with an “at target” STI payment prorated for the duration she was employed during Fiscal 2025. As a result, Ms. Ranganathan’s “at target” payout in Fiscal 2025 was $640,865, based on her annual STI target of $775,000.
Long-Term Incentives
We incentivize our executive officers, including our NEOs, in part, with long-term compensation pursuant to our LTIP. Our LTIP grants represent a significant proportion of our NEOs’ total compensation, and their purpose is two-fold: (i) as a component of a competitive compensation package; and (ii) to align the interests of our NEOs with the interests of our shareholders.
For each LTIP grant, a target value is established by the Talent and Compensation Committee for each NEO, except for the CEO, whose target value is established by the Board, based on competitive market practice and by the respective NEO’s ability to influence financial or operational performance. The target values of the annual grants are consistent with competitive market practice, set to ensure that the annual total direct target compensation packages are appropriately positioned relative to our peer group for each of our NEOs. Grant amounts consider the desired pay mix, competitive position and internal equity across our NEOs. The program is designed to ensure alignment with our performance over the longer term, with a very high percentage of the long-term incentive being “at risk”.
The performance goals and the weightings of performance goals under the LTIP are first recommended by the Talent and Compensation Committee and then approved by the Board. Grants are generally made annually and for grants made in August 2024 (for Fiscal 2025) were comprised of the components outlined in the table below.
Vehicle
Vesting
Performance Share Units (PSUs)
All NEOs: Cliff vesting occurs in the third year following the determination by the Board that the performance criteria have been met for the rTSR metric.
(1)
Restricted Share Units (RSUs)
Vesting occurs annually in equal amounts on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date.
Stock Options
Vesting occurs at a rate of 25% on each of the first four anniversaries of grant date. Stock options expire seven years after the grant date.
______________________
(1)
The number of PSUs to vest will be based on the Company’s rTSR at the end of a three-year period as compared to the TSR of the constituents of the NASDAQ Composite Index.
Once vested, PSUs and RSUs will be settled in either Common Shares or cash, at the discretion of the Board. Once vested, stock options may be exercised for Common Shares.
Payouts under LTIP grants:
•
May be subject to certain limitations in the event of early termination of employment or change in control of the Company; and
•
When cash dividends are paid by the Company on outstanding Common Shares, the Company credits additional dividend equivalent PSUs and RSUs to the participant’s account. Dividend equivalent PSUs and RSUs are subject to the same terms and conditions as the granted PSUs or RSUs, as applicable, and vest and are settled at the same time and in the same form as the PSUs or RSUs to which such dividend equivalent PSUs or RSUs relate. The dividend equivalents for PSUs are only credited for shares earned under the PSU program.
LTIP - PSU Grants in Fiscal 2025
In Fiscal 2025, we maintained our practice of granting PSUs to all NEOs, with vesting tied to rTSR. Since the Fiscal 2024 grant cycle, we have benchmarked our performance against the three-year TSR of companies in the NASDAQ Composite Index. This index is heavily weighted towards the information technology sector, aligning with alternative investment opportunities available to our shareholders.
To further strengthen the performance orientation of our PSU program, we refined the rTSR metric in Fiscal 2025 to raise the requirement for achieving a target payout. Under the revised design, PSUs are earned at the target level only if our rTSR exceeds the median – specifically, at or above the 55th percentile – reinforcing our commitment to strong, market-leading performance.

Our CEO’s annual LTIP grant is positioned 26% below the median of our selected peer group, which the Talent and Compensation Committee (with advice from its independent compensation consultant) considered appropriate. Further, as our CEO continues to hold outstanding performance-based equity from prior years, it was determined that there would be no change to the target grant value of our CEO’s annual LTIP grant in Fiscal 2025 (as compared to Fiscal 2024). 
For NEOs, at least 50% of the equity value of their LTIP awards was delivered in the form of PSUs, reinforcing our commitment to performance-based compensation.

Mr. Westlake joined the Company in March 2025. In connection with his hire, Mr. Westlake received a prorated grant (79% of target value) based on his start date relative to the performance cycle. The LTIP grant, which would have vested in Fiscal 2027, will be cancelled following Mr. Westlake’s departure from the Company effective August 15, 2025.
For details of our previous LTIPs, see Item 11 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the relevant year.
LTIP - PSU Vesting in 2025
PSUs granted in Fiscal 2022 were eligible to vest during Fiscal 2025, based on rTSR performance compared to the designated index over a three-year performance period. During this period, the Company placed at the 35
th
 percentile relative to the S&P Midcap 400 Software & Services Peer Group used for the Fiscal 2022 PSU award. This performance resulted in a 70% payout of the original PSU grant. The Board determined that this outcome accurately reflected the Company’s rTSR performance in accordance with the plan, and no discretionary adjustments were made to the calculated payout under the plan’s rules.
LTIP – 
Organic Growth Acceleration Program (OGAP)
In Fiscal 2024, as part of our annual LTIP, we made PSU award grants to our NEOs (excluding our CEO) under the OGAP, such PSUs being tied to an organic growth two-year revenue performance metric and eligible to vest by June 30, 2025. However, the threshold performance was not achieved at the end of the two-year performance period. As a result, the Board deemed that no discretion would be applied and that no PSUs would be earned under this program. The OGAP was retired in Fiscal 2025, and no new grants under the OGAP have been made.
LTIP - RSUs
RSUs are not subject to specific performance-based vesting criteria. Instead, they are intended to promote employment retention over the three-year vesting period and align with share price movements over time.

LTIP - Stock Options
For Fiscal 2026 grants, stock options will no longer be included in the annual LTIP awards for our current CEO and other NEOs. Instead, their annual LTIP grants will consist of PSUs for our CEO and a mix of PSUs and RSUs for our other NEOs. 
Stock options that were previously granted under earlier annual LTIP awards will continue to vest over a four-year period and will only have value if our stock price increases during their seven-year term. For a discussion of the assumptions used in the valuation of stock options, see Note 13 “Equity and Share-based Compensation” to our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. All stock option grants, whether part of the annual LTIP prior to Fiscal 2026 or granted separately for new hires, promotions, retention or other reasons, are governed by our stock option plan. The price at which stock options are granted is not less than the closing price of the Company’s Common Shares on the trading day for the NASDAQ immediately preceding the applicable grant date. In addition, grants and exercises of stock options are subject to our Insider Trading Policy. For details of our Insider Trading Policy, see “Other Information with Respect to Our Compensation Program - Insider Trading Policy” below.
Section VII - Other Elements of Our Compensation Program
Executive Change in Control and Severance Benefits
Our severance benefit agreements are designed to provide reasonable compensation to departing senior executive officers under certain circumstances. While we do not believe that the severance benefits would be a determinative factor in a senior executive’s decision to join or remain with the Company, the absence of such benefits, we believe, would present a distinct competitive disadvantage in the market for talented executive officers. Furthermore, we believe that it is important to set forth the benefits payable in triggering circumstances in advance to avoid future disputes or litigation.
The severance benefits we offer to our senior executive officers are competitive with similarly situated individuals and companies. We have structured our senior executive officers’ change in control benefits as “double trigger” benefits, meaning that the benefits are paid only in the event of, first, a change in control transaction, and second, a change in relationship between the Company and the senior executive officer within one year after the transaction. These benefits are intended to incentivize our senior executive officers to remain employed with the Company in such a transaction.
Perquisites
Our NEOs receive a minimal amount of non-cash compensation in the form of executive perquisites. To remain competitive in the marketplace, our NEOs are entitled to some limited benefits that are not otherwise available to all our employees, including:
•
An annual executive medical physical examination; and
•
An annual allowance to reimburse expenses to a pre-defined maximum related to financial planning such as tax preparation, additional life insurance, financial planning and/or estate planning advice.
Other Benefits
We provide various employee benefit programs on the same terms to all employees, including our NEOs, such as, but not limited to:
•
Medical health insurance; 
•
Dental insurance;
•
Life insurance; and
•
Tax-based retirement savings plans matching contributions.

NEOs residing in the United States may be eligible to continue participation in US Open Text health care plans upon retirement on the condition that the costs of the benefit are fully borne by the retiree.
Pension Plans
We do not provide pension benefits or any non-qualified deferred compensation to any of our NEOs.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
We have entered into employment contracts with each of our NEOs. These contracts may require us to make certain types of payments and provide certain types of benefits to the NEOs upon the occurrence of any of these events:
•
If the NEO is terminated without cause; and
•
If there is a change in control in the ownership of the Company and subsequent to the change in control, there is a change in the employment relationship between the Company and the NEO.
When determining the amounts and the type of compensation and benefits to provide in the event of a termination or change in control described above, we considered available information with respect to amounts payable to similarly situated officers of our peer groups and the position held by the NEO within the Company. The amounts payable upon termination or change in control represent the amounts determined by the Company and are not the result of any individual negotiations between us and any of our NEOs.
Our employment agreements with our NEOs are similar in structure, terms and conditions, with the key exception of the amount of severance payments, which is determined by the position held by the NEO. Details are set out below of each of their potential payments upon a termination by the Company without cause and upon a change in control event where there is a subsequent change in the employment relationship between the Company and the NEO.
Termination Without Cause
If the NEO is terminated without cause, we may be obligated to make payments or provide benefits to the NEO. A termination without cause means a termination of an NEO for any reason other than the following, each of which provides “cause” for termination:
•
The failure by the NEO to attempt in good faith to perform their duties, other than as a result of a physical or mental illness or injury;
•
The NEO’s willful misconduct or gross negligence of a material nature in connection with the performance of their duties which is or could reasonably be expected to be injurious to the Company; 
•
The breach by the NEO of their fiduciary duty or duty of loyalty to the Company; 
122
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
•
The NEO’s intentional and unauthorized removal, use or disclosure of information relating to the Company, including customer information, which is injurious to the Company or its customers;
•
The willful performance by the NEO of any act of dishonesty or willful misappropriation of funds or property of the Company or its affiliates;
•
The indictment of the NEO or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or other serious crime involving moral turpitude;
•
The material breach by the NEO of any obligation material to their employment relationship with the Company; or 
•
The material breach by the NEO of the Company’s policies and procedures which breach causes or could reasonably be expected to cause harm to the Company;
provided that in certain of the circumstances listed above, the Company has given the NEO reasonable notice of the reason for termination as well as a reasonable opportunity to correct the circumstances giving rise to the termination.
Change in Control
If there is a change in control of the Company and within one year of such change in control event, there is a change in the employment relationship between the Company and the NEO without the NEO’s written consent, we may be obligated to provide payments or benefits to the NEO, unless such a change is in connection with the termination of the NEO either for cause or due to the death or disability of the NEO.
A change in control includes the following events:
•
The sale, lease, exchange or other transfer, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets;
•
The approval by the holders of Common Shares of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the Company;
•
Any transaction in which any person or group acquires ownership of more than 50% of outstanding Common Shares; or
•
Any transaction in which a majority of the Board is replaced over a twelve-month period and such replacement of the Board was not approved by a majority of the Board still in office at the beginning of such period.
Examples of a change in the employment relationship between the NEO and the Company where payments or benefits may be triggered following a change in control event include:
•
A material diminution in the duties and responsibilities of the NEO, other than (a) a change arising solely out of the Company becoming part of a larger organization following the change in control event or any related change in the reporting hierarchy or (b) a reorganization of the Company resulting in similar changes to the duties and responsibilities of similarly situated executive officers; 
•
A material reduction to the NEO’s compensation, other than a similar reduction to the compensation of similarly situated executive officers; 
•
A relocation of the NEO’s primary work location by more than fifty miles; or
•
A reduction in the title or position of the NEO, other than (a) a change arising solely out of the Company becoming part of a larger organization following the change in control event or any related change in the reporting hierarchy or (b) a reorganization of the Company resulting in similar changes to the titles or positions of similarly situated executive officers. 
None of our NEOs are entitled to the payments or benefits described below, or any other payments or benefits, solely upon a change in control where there is no change to the NEO’s employment relationship with the Company.
Amounts Payable Upon Termination or Change in Control
Pursuant to our employment agreements with our NEOs and the terms of our LTIP, each NEO’s entitlement upon termination of employment without cause or following a change in the NEO’s relationship with the Company, both absent a change in control event and within twelve months of a change in control event, are set forth below.
PSU vesting acceleration provisions within 12 months of a change in control are aligned with peer group practices to provide for the number of PSUs earned to be based on actual rTSR performance through the change in control date.

Mr. Westlake will receive no severance as he voluntarily resigned effective August 15, 2025. As a result, amounts payable within 12 months of a change in control is not applicable. However, had he not submitted his voluntary resignation, the following terms would have applied as of June 30, 2025: base salary: 12 months; short term incentives: 12 months; LTIP: 100% vested; options: 100% vested; and employee and medical benefits: 12 months.
In addition to the information identified above, each NEO is entitled to all accrued payments up to the date of termination, including all earned but unpaid short-term incentive amounts and earned but unsettled LTIP. Except as otherwise required by law, we are required to make all these payments and provide these benefits over a period of 12 months or 24 months, depending on the NEO’s entitlement and the circumstances which triggered our obligation to make such payments and provide such benefits, from the date of the event which triggered our obligation. With respect to payments to Mr. Barrenechea, the Company intends to make all required payments to Mr. Barrenechea no later than two and a half months after the end of the later of the fiscal year or calendar year in which the payments are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture
.
In return for receiving the payments and the benefits described above, each NEO must comply with certain obligations in favour of the Company, including a non-disparagement obligation. Also, each NEO is bound by a confidentiality and non-solicitation agreement where the non-solicitation obligation lasts six months from the date of termination of their employment.
Any breach by an NEO of any provision of his/her contractual agreements may only be waived by the Company upon the review and approval of the Board.
Quantitative Estimates of Payments upon Termination or Change in Control
Further information regarding payments to our NEOs in the event of a termination or a change in control may be found in the table below. This table sets forth the estimated amount of payments and other benefits each NEO would be entitled to receive upon the occurrence of the indicated event, assuming that the event occurred on June 30, 2025. Amounts (i) potentially payable under plans which are generally available to all of our salaried employees, such as life and disability insurance, and (ii) earned but unpaid, in both cases, are excluded from the table. The values related to vesting of stock options and awards are based upon the fair market value of our Common Shares of $29.20 per share as reported on the NASDAQ on June 30, 2025, the last trading day of our fiscal year. The other material assumptions made with respect to the numbers reported in the table below are:
•
The salary and incentive payments are calculated based on the amounts of salary, incentive and benefit payments which were payable to each NEO as of June 30, 2025; and
•
Payments under the LTIPs are calculated as though 100% of outstanding LTIP awards have vested with respect to a termination without cause or change in relationship following a change in control event, and as though a pro-rated amount have vested with respect to no change in control event.
Actual payments made at any future date may vary, including the amount the NEO would have accrued under the applicable benefit or compensation plan as well as the price of our Common Shares.
Ms. Ranganathan ceased to be our Chief Financial Officer in March 2025 and therefore is not included in the tables below.

In accordance with the terms of his employment agreement, as amended, Mr. Barrenechea is entitled to participate until the age of 70 in healthcare benefits substantially similar to what he currently receives as Vice Chair, CEO and CTO of the Company. These benefits will be provided at the cost of the Company, provided that Mr. Barrenechea continues to be responsible for funding an amount that is equal to his employee contribution as Vice Chair, CEO and CTO, unless he becomes employed elsewhere, at which point this benefit will terminate. In the event that the employee or company contribution funding increases, Mr. Barrenechea would be responsible for that increase.

Mr. Westlake will receive no severance as he voluntarily resigned effective August 15, 2025. As a result, amounts payable upon a termination or change in control are not applicable. However, had he not submitted his voluntary resignation, the following amounts would have been applied as of June 30, 2025: (a) Termination Without Cause / Change in Relationship with no Change in Control: salary: $190,193; short-term incentive payment: $585,210; gain on vesting of LTIP and non-LTIP RSUs: $—; gain on vesting of stock options: $—; employee benefits: $—; and total: $775,403; and (b) Termination Without Cause / Change in Relationship, within 12 months following a Change in Control: salary: $190,193; short-term incentive payment: $585,210; gain on vesting of LTIP and Non-LTIP RSUs: $1,428,074; gain on vesting of stock options: $818,170; employee benefits: $—; and total: $3,021,647.
Insider Trading Policy
All our employees, officers and directors, including our NEOs, are required to comply with our Insider Trading Policy. Our Insider Trading Policy prohibits the purchase, sale or trade of our securities with the knowledge of material inside information. In addition, our Insider Trading Policy prohibits our employees, officers and directors, including our NEOs, from, directly or indirectly, short selling any security of the Company or entering into any other arrangement that results in a gain only if the value of the Company’s securities decline in the future, selling a “call option” giving the holder an option to purchase securities of the Company, or buying a “put option” giving the holder an option to sell securities of the Company. The definition of “trading in securities” includes any derivatives-based, monetization, non-recourse loan or similar arrangement that changes the insider’s economic exposure to or interest in securities of the Company and which may not necessarily involve a sale.
All grants of long-term incentive awards are subject to our Insider Trading Policy and as a result, may not be granted during the “blackout” period beginning on the fifteenth day of the last month of each quarter and ending at the beginning of the second trading day following the date on which the Company’s quarterly or annual financial results, as applicable, have been publicly released. If the Board approves the issuance of any awards during the blackout period, these awards will not be granted until the blackout period is over. Further, we do not grant awards in anticipation of the release of material nonpublic information or time the release of material nonpublic information for the purpose of affecting the value of such grants.

Clawback Policy
In accordance with SEC rules and NASDAQ listing standards and in line with market practice, we adopted a clawback policy (Clawback Policy) which mandates the recovery of certain erroneously paid incentive-based compensation received by our executive officers on or after October 2, 2023, if we have a qualifying financial restatement during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the fiscal year in which a financial restatement determination is made, subject to limited exceptions in accordance with SEC rules. Recovery is required regardless of whether the executive officer was involved in the preparation of the relevant financial statements. During Fiscal 2025, the Company did not have any qualifying financial restatement that required recovery of erroneously awarded compensation pursuant to the Clawback Policy.
Share Ownership Guidelines
We currently have equity ownership guidelines (Share Ownership Guidelines), the objective of which is to encourage our senior management, including our NEOs, and our directors to buy and hold Common Shares in the Company based upon an investment target. 
Our required equity ownership levels are as follows:
CEO
6x base salary
Other senior management
2x base salary
Non-management director
5x annual retainer
For purposes of the Share Ownership Guidelines, individuals are deemed to hold all securities over which they are the registered or beneficial owner thereof under the rules of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise in which such person has or shares:
•
voting power which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of, such security; and/or 
•
investment power which includes the power to dispose, or to direct the disposition of, such security.
The result is that only Common Shares 
–
 not unvested equity-based compensation 
–
 and, for non-management directors, deferred share units (DSUs), are eligible forms of equity for purposes of Share Ownership Guideline fulfillment. Also, Common Shares are valued at the greater of their book value (i.e., purchase price) or the current market value. On an annual basis, the Talent and Compensation Committee reviews the recommended ownership levels under the Share Ownership Guidelines and the compliance by our executive officers and directors with the Share Ownership Guidelines.
The Board originally implemented the Share Ownership Guidelines in October 2009 and recommends that equity ownership levels be achieved within five years of becoming a member of the executive leadership team, including NEOs. As a result of the changes to the ownership guidelines for such individuals will have until 2030 to achieve the new share ownership requirements. The Board recommends that senior management retain their ownership levels for as long as they remain members of the executive leadership team. We believe that the Share Ownership Guidelines help align the financial interests of our senior management team and directors with the financial interests of our shareholders.
Named Executive Officers
NEOs may achieve the Share Ownership Guidelines through the exercise of stock option awards for Common Shares, Common Shares received as a result of vested RSUs or PSUs, purchases under the ESPP, through open market purchases made in compliance with applicable securities laws or through any equity plan(s) we may adopt from time to time providing for the acquisition of Common Shares. Until the Share Ownership Guidelines are met, it is recommended that an NEO retain a portion of any stock option exercise or LTIP award in Common Shares to contribute to the achievement of the Share Ownership Guidelines. Common Shares issuable pursuant to the unexercised options are not counted towards meeting the equity ownership target.
All NEOs are in compliance with the Share Ownership Guidelines applicable to them for Fiscal 2025.
Directors
Regarding non-management directors, both Common Shares and deferred stock units (DSUs) are counted towards the achievement of the Share Ownership Guidelines. The Company currently has a Directors’ Deferred Share Unit Plan (DSU Plan), whereby any non-management director of the Company may elect to defer all or part of their retainer and/or fees in the form of common stock equivalents. As of the date of the Circular, all non-management directors, as applicable to them, are in

Non-management directors may elect to receive DSUs or cash for their directors’ fees and/or annual equity grant. Cash paid for directors’ fees are paid in accordance with the scheduled fee arrangements set forth in the table below. If cash is elected for the annual equity grant, such cash is payable at the Company’s next annual general meeting. In Fiscal 2025, Messrs. Jenkins and Mses. Weinstein elected to receive cash for all of their annual equity grant.
(2)
Non-management directors may elect to defer all or a portion of their retainer and/or fees in the form of DSUs under our DSU Plan based on the value of the Company’s shares as of the date fees would otherwise be paid. The DSU Plan, originally effective February 2, 2010, and amended and restated in October 2018, is available to any non-management director of the Company and is designed to promote greater alignment of long-term interests between directors of the Company and its shareholders. DSUs granted as compensation for directors’ fees vest immediately whereas the DSUs granted for the annual equity grant vest at the Company’s next annual general meeting. No DSUs are payable by the Company until the director ceases to be a member of the Board.

The amounts set forth in this column represent the amount recognized as the aggregate grant date fair value of equity-based compensation awards, inclusive of DSU dividend equivalents, as calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 718. These amounts do not reflect whether the recipient has actually realized a financial benefit from the awards. For a discussion of the assumptions used in this valuation, see Note 13 “Equity and Share-based Compensation” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In Fiscal 2025, Messrs. Jenkins, Fowlie, Fraser, Hau, Hyder, Previn, Sadler and Slaunwhite and Mses. Hamilton, Powell, Rippert, Stevenson and Weinstein received 5,768, 12,881, 10,494, 8,824, 7,999, 9,786, 15,313, 4,650, 2,915, 620, 13,292, 16,307, and 9,479 DSUs, respectively.

During Fiscal 2025, Mr. Sadler received $6,537 in consulting fees, paid or payable in cash, for assistance with acquisition-related business activities. Mr. Sadler abstained from voting on all transactions from which he would potentially derive consulting fees.
The Board sets the level of compensation for directors, based on the recommendations of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. From time to time, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee reviews the amount and form of compensation paid to directors, having regard to the workload and responsibilities involved in being an effective director, and benchmarked against director compensation for comparable companies. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee’s review may be conducted with the assistance of outside consultants. Directors who are salaried officers or employees receive no compensation for serving as directors. Mr. Barrenechea was the only employee director in Fiscal 2025. The material terms of our director compensation arrangements are as follows
: 
Description

Amount and Frequency of Payment
Annual Chair retainer fee payable to the Chair of the Board
$200,000 per year payable following our annual general meeting
Annual retainer fee payable to each non-management director
$75,000 per director payable following our annual general meeting

Annual Audit Committee retainer fee payable to each member of the Audit Committee
$25,000 per year payable at $6,250 at the beginning of each quarterly period.

Annual Audit Committee Chair retainer fee payable to the Chair of the Audit Committee
$10,000 per year payable at $2,500 at the beginning of each quarterly period.

Annual Talent and Compensation Committee retainer fee payable to each member of the Talent and Compensation Committee
$15,000 per year payable at $3,750 at the beginning of each quarterly period.

Annual Talent and Compensation Committee Chair retainer fee payable to the Chair of the Talent and Compensation Committee
$10,000 per year payable at $2,500 at the beginning of each quarterly period.

Annual Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee retainer fee payable to each member of the Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee
$10,000 per year payable at $2,500 at the beginning of each quarterly period.

Annual Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee Chair retainer fee payable to the Chair of the Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee
$8,000 per year payable at $2,000 at the beginning of each quarterly period.
Excess travel fee payable to each non-management director attending a meeting who travels more than six hours
$2,000 per meeting when applicable
In addition to the scheduled fee arrangements set forth in the table above, non-management directors also receive an annual equity grant representing the long-term component of their compensation. The amount of the annual equity grant is discretionary; however, historically, the amount of this grant has been determined and updated on a periodic basis with the assistance of the Talent and Compensation Committee and the compensation consultant and benchmarked against director compensation for comparable companies. For Fiscal 2025, the annual equity grant was $250,000 for each non-management director and $320,000 for the Chair of the Board.

Non-management directors may elect to receive DSUs or cash for their directors’ fees and/or annual equity grant. DSUs are granted under a DSU Plan, which is available to any non-management director of the Company. DSUs granted as compensation for directors’ fees vest immediately whereas DSUs granted for the annual equity grant vest at the Company’s next annual general meeting. If cash is elected for the annual equity grant, such cash is also payable at the Company’s next annual general meeting. No DSUs are payable by the Company until the director ceases to be a member of the Board.
As with its employees, the Company believes that granting compensation to directors in the form of equity, such as DSUs, promotes a greater alignment of long-term interests between directors of the Company and the shareholders of the Company. For further details of our Share Ownership Guidelines as they relate to directors, see “Share Ownership Guidelines” above. 
Talent and Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
The members of our Talent and Compensation Committee consist of Ms. Rippert and Messrs. Hyder and Fraser. None of the members of the Talent and Compensation Committee have been or are an officer or employee of the Company, or any of our subsidiaries, or had any relationship requiring disclosure herein. None of our executive officers served as a member of the compensation committee of another entity (or other committee of the Board of Directors performing equivalent functions, or in the absence of any such committee, the entire Board of Directors) one of whose executive officers served as a director of ours.
Board’s Role in Risk Oversight
The Board has overall responsibility for risk oversight. The Board is responsible for overseeing management’s implementation and operation of enterprise risk management, either directly or through its committees, which shall report to the Board with respect to risk oversight undertaken in accordance with their respective charters. At least annually, the Board shall review reports provided by management on the risks inherent in the business of the Company (including appropriate crisis preparedness, business continuity, information system controls, cybersecurity programs and risks, and disaster recovery plans, as well as environmental, social and governance matters, including climate-related matters), the appropriate degree of risk mitigation and risk control, overall compliance with and the effectiveness of the Company’s risk management policies, and residual risks remaining after implementation of risk controls. In addition, each committee reviews and reports to the Board on risk oversight matters, as described below.
The Audit Committee oversees risks related to our accounting, financial statements and financial reporting process. On a quarterly basis, the Audit Committee also reviews reports provided by management on the risks inherent in the business of the Company, including those related to cybersecurity programs and risks, and disaster recovery plans, and reports to the Board with respect to risk oversight undertaken.
The Talent and Compensation Committee oversees risks which may be associated with our compensation policies, practices and programs, in particular with respect to our executive officers. The Talent and Compensation Committee assesses such risks with the review and assistance of the Company’s management and the Talent and Compensation Committee’s external compensation consultants.
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee monitors risk and potential risks with respect to the effectiveness of the Board, and considers aspects such as director succession, Board composition and the principal policies that guide the Company’s overall corporate governance.
The members of each of the Audit Committee, the Talent and Compensation Committee, and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee are all “independent” directors within the meaning ascribed to it in Multilateral Instrument 52-110-
Audit Committees
 as well as the listing standards of the NASDAQ, and, in the case of the Audit Committee, the additional independence requirements set out by the SEC.
All of our directors are kept informed of our business through open discussions with our management team, including our CEO, who serves on our Board. The Board also receives documents, such as quarterly and periodic management reports and financial statements, as well our directors have access to all books, records and reports upon request, and members of management are available at all times to answer any questions which Board members may have.
Item 12.  Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters 
The following table sets forth certain information as of June 30, 2025 regarding Common Shares beneficially owned by the following persons or companies: (i) each person or company known by us to be the beneficial owner of approximately 5% or more of our outstanding Common Shares, (ii) each director of our Company, (iii) each Named Executive Officer, and (iv) all directors and executive officers as a group. Except as otherwise indicated, we believe that the beneficial owners of the Common Shares listed below have sole investment and voting power with respect to such Common Shares, subject to community property laws where applicable.

Item 13.  Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence
Related Transactions Policy and Director Independence
We have adopted a written policy that all transactional agreements between us and related parties be first approved by a majority of the independent directors. Once these agreements are approved, payments made pursuant to the agreements are approved by the members of our Audit Committee. A related party includes any officer, director, affiliates or beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of voting equity securities.
Our procedure regarding the approval of any related party transaction is that the material facts of such transaction shall be reviewed by the independent members of our Audit Committee and the transaction approved by a majority of the independent members of our Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews all transactions wherein we are, or will be a participant and any related party has or will have a direct or indirect interest. In determining whether to approve a related party transaction, the Audit Committee generally takes into account, among other facts it deems appropriate: whether the transaction is on terms no less favourable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances; the extent and nature of the related person’s interest in the transaction; the benefits to the company of the proposed transaction; if applicable, the effects on a director’s independence; and if applicable, the availability of other sources of comparable services or products. Other than as discussed below and the compensation arrangements disclosed under Part II, Item 11, “Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have not been any transactions to which we are a party, nor are there any proposed transactions to which we would be a party, with related parties for which we are required to disclose pursuant to the rules of the SEC and the Canadian Securities Administrators. 
The Board has determined that all directors, except Messrs. Barrenechea and Sadler, meet the independence requirements under the NASDAQ Listing Rules and qualify as “independent directors” under those Listing Rules. Mr. Barrenechea is not considered independent by virtue of being our Vice Chair, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer. See “Transactions with Related Persons” below with respect to payments made to Mr. Sadler. Each of the members of our Talent and Compensation Committee, Audit Committee and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is an independent director. 
Transactions With Related Persons
One of our directors, Mr. Sadler, received consulting fees for assistance with acquisition-related business activities pursuant to a consulting agreement with the Company. Mr. Sadler’s consulting agreement, which was adopted by way of Board resolution effective July 1, 2011, is for an indefinite period. The material terms of the agreement are as follows: Mr. Sadler is paid at the rate of Canadian dollars (CAD) $450 per hour for services relating to his consulting agreement. In addition, he is eligible to receive a bonus fee equivalent to 1.0% of the acquired company’s revenues, up to CAD $10.0 million in revenue, plus an additional amount of 0.5% of the acquired company’s revenues above CAD $10.0 million. The total bonus fee payable, for any given fiscal year, is subject to an annual limit of CAD $450,000 per single acquisition and an aggregate annual limit of

CAD $980,000. The acquired company’s revenues, for this purpose, is equal to the acquired company’s revenues for the 12 months prior to the date of acquisition. During Fiscal 2025, Mr. Sadler received CAD $9 thousand in consulting fees from OpenText (equivalent to $7 thousand USD), for assistance with acquisition-related business activities. Mr. Sadler abstained from voting on all transactions from which he would potentially derive consulting fees. Additionally, Mr. Sadler has direct or indirect control over a material interest in Enghouse Systems Limited, a publicly traded software company, and its subsidiaries. OpenText entered into product supply and license agreements to purchase certain software licenses from Enghouse Systems Limited and its subsidiaries, under which the company makes payments in the normal course of business. During Fiscal 2025, OpenText paid $1.6 million under such agreements.
Item 14.  Principal Accountant Fees and Services 
Pre-approval Policies and Procedures 
The Audit Committee has established an Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy to pre-approve all permissible audit and non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. The policy provides that the Audit Committee shall pre-approve all audit and non-audit services to be provided to the Company and its subsidiaries by its independent registered public accounting firm. 
On an annual basis, the Audit Committee reviews and provides pre-approval for certain types of services that may be rendered by the independent registered accounting firm and a budget for audit and non-audit services for the applicable fiscal year. Upon pre-approval of the services on the initial list, management may engage the auditor for specific engagements that are within the definition of the pre-approved services. Any significant service engagements above a certain threshold will require separate pre-approval. 
The policy contains a provision delegating pre-approval authority to the Chair of the Audit Committee in instances when pre-approval is needed prior to a scheduled Audit Committee meeting. The Chair of the Audit Committee is required to report on such pre-approvals at the next scheduled Audit Committee meeting. A final detailed review of all audit and non-audit services and fees is performed by the Audit Committee prior to the issuance of the audit opinion at year-end. The Audit Committee has determined that the provision of the services set out below is compatible with the maintaining of KPMG LLP’s independence in the conduct of its auditing functions.
No services in 2025 and 2024 were provided by KPMG for which the foregoing pre-approval procedures were waived pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Open Text Corporation
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Open Text Corporation (the Company) as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Evaluation of the determination of standalone selling prices of revenue performance obligations for customer contracts with a software license
As discussed in Note 2 and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company generally sells or licenses its software in combination with customer support. The accounting for customer contracts with a software license requires an allocation of the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the determination of the standalone selling price (SSP). SSP for a performance obligation in a customer contract is an estimate of the price that would be charged for the specific product or service if it was sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. This estimate determines the allocation of the transaction price and affects the amount and timing of revenue recognized for each performance obligation in a customer contract.
We identified the evaluation of the determination of the SSP of revenue performance obligations for customer contracts with a software license as a critical audit matter. A higher degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the approach and the significant assumptions, including the basis for stratification, used to establish SSP for each performance obligation which could be offered in a customer contract. 
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s revenue process, including controls over the approach and the significant assumptions used to determine SSP for identified performance obligations in customer contracts which include a software license. We evaluated the approach used to determine SSP based on current pricing patterns in relevant customer contracts, historical analysis of renewal contract pricing completed by the Company and pricing practices

observed in the industry. We inspected a selection of contracts from the SSP population and compared attributes such as price to historical information.
Assessment of uncertain tax positions
As discussed in Note 2, Note 14 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recognized uncertain tax positions including associated interest and penalties. The Company’s tax positions are subject to audit by local taxing authorities across multiple global subsidiaries and the resolution of such audits may span multiple years. Tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations. Accordingly, the ultimate outcome with respect to taxes the Company may owe may differ from the amounts recognized. 
We identified the assessment of uncertain tax positions and the ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions as an area of auditor judgment in evaluating the Company’s interpretation of, and compliance with, tax law globally across multiple jurisdictions. 
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s process to assess uncertain tax positions, including controls related to the interpretation of tax law and identification of uncertain tax positions, the evaluation of which of the Company’s tax positions may not be sustained upon audit and the estimation of exposures associated with uncertain tax positions. We involved domestic and international tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in assessing filed tax positions and transfer pricing studies, and evaluating the Company’s interpretation of tax law and its assessment of certain tax uncertainties and expected outcomes, including, if applicable, the measurement thereof, by reading advice obtained from the Company’s external specialists and correspondence with taxation authorities.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Open Text Corporation:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
We have audited Open Text Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, Open Text Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes, and our report dated August 6, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

OPEN TEXT CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For the Year Ended June 30, 2025
(Tabular amounts in thousands of U.S. dollars, except share and per share data)
NOTE 1—
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Open Text Corporation and our subsidiaries, collectively referred to as “OpenText” or the “Company.” We wholly own all of our subsidiaries with the exception of Open Text South Africa Proprietary Ltd. (OT South Africa), which as of June 30, 2025, was 
70
% owned by OpenText. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
The Company's fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. Unless otherwise noted, any reference to a year preceded by the word “Fiscal” refers to the fiscal year ended June 30 of that year. For example, references to “Fiscal 2025” refer to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.
These Consolidated Financial Statements are expressed in U.S. dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). The information furnished reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented and includes the consolidated financial results of Micro Focus International Limited, formerly Micro Focus International plc, and its subsidiaries (Micro Focus), with effect from February 1, 2023 and impacts from the sale of the Application Modernization and Connectivity (AMC) business on May 1, 2024 (see below and Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” for more details).
Beginning in the first quarter of Fiscal 2025, for the years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company reclassified expenses of $
29.5
 million and $
21.4
 million, respectively, from Research and development to Sales and marketing in the Consolidated Statements of Income to provide a better representation of the function of the expenses.
Use of estimates 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable at that time, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates. In particular, key estimates, judgments and assumptions include those related to: (i) revenue recognition, (ii) accounting for income taxes, (iii) testing of goodwill for impairment, (iv) the valuation of acquired intangible assets, (v) the valuation of long-lived assets, (vi) the recognition of contingencies, (vii) restructuring accruals, (viii) acquisition accruals and pre-acquisition contingencies, (ix) the valuation of stock options granted and obligations related to share-based compensation, including the valuation of our long-term incentive plans, (x) the valuation of pension obligations and pension assets, (xi) the valuation of available-for-sale investments and (xii) the valuation of derivative instruments.
Acquisition of Micro Focus
On January 31, 2023, we acquired all of the issued and to be issued share capital of Micro Focus (the Micro Focus Acquisition) for a total purchase price of $
6.2
 billion, inclusive of Micro Focus’ cash and repayment of Micro Focus’ outstanding indebtedness. The results of operations of Micro Focus have been consolidated with those of OpenText with effect from February 1, 2023. See Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” for more details.
Divestiture of AMC Business
On May 1, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its Application Modernization and Connectivity (AMC) business to Rocket Software, Inc. (Rocket Software), for $
2.275
 billion in cash before taxes, fees and other adjustments (the AMC Divestiture). See Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” for more details. The Company determined that the AMC business did not constitute a component, as its operations and cash flows could not be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Company’s operations and cash flows due to significant shared costs. Therefore, the transaction did not meet the discontinued operations criteria, and the results of operations from the AMC business were presented within Income from operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income up to the date of divestiture.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Accounting Policies
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include balances with banks as well as deposits that have original terms to maturity of three months or less. Cash equivalents are recorded at cost and typically consist of term deposits, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and short-term interest-bearing investment-grade securities of major banks in the countries in which we operate.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses
In accordance with ASC Topic 326, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses” (Topic 326), we recognize expected credit losses for accounts receivable and contract assets based on lifetime expected losses. We recognize a loss allowance using a collective assessment for accounts receivable, including contract assets, with similar risk characteristics based on historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and economic environment. We continue to maintain an allowance for 100% of all accounts deemed to be uncollectible.
Customer creditworthiness is evaluated prior to order fulfillment and based on evaluations, we adjust our credit limit to the respective customer. In addition to these evaluations, we conduct on-going credit evaluations of our customers’ payment history and current credit worthiness. To date, the actual losses have been within our expectations. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable balance as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
From time to time, we may sell certain accounts receivable to a financial institution on a non-recourse basis for cash, less a discount. Proceeds from the sale of receivables approximate their discounted book value and are included in operating cash flows on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Property and equipment
Property and equipment are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and shown net of depreciation which is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Gains and losses on asset disposals are taken into income in the year of disposition. Fully depreciated property and equipment are retired from the Consolidated Balance Sheets when they are no longer in use.
 See the “Impairment of long-lived assets” section below for policy on property and equipment impairments. 
The following represents the estimated useful lives of property and equipment as of June 30, 2025:
Furniture, equipment and other

 years
Capitalized Software
We capitalize software development costs in accordance with ASC Topic 350-40, “Internal-Use Software.” We capitalize costs for software to be used internally when we enter the application development stage. This occurs when we complete the preliminary project stage, management authorizes and commits to funding the project, and it is feasible that the project will be completed, and the software will perform the intended function. We cease to capitalize costs related to a software project when it enters the post-implementation and operation stage. If different determinations are made with respect to the state of development of a software project, then the amount capitalized and the amount charged to expense for that project could differ materially.
 Costs capitalized during the application development stage consist of payroll and related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote time directly to, a project to develop software for internal use. We also capitalize the direct costs of materials and services, which generally includes outside contractors, and interest. We do not capitalize any general and administrative or overhead costs or costs incurred during the application development stage related to training or data conversion costs. Costs related to upgrades and enhancements to internal-use software, if those upgrades and enhancements result in additional functionality, are capitalized. If upgrades and enhancements do not result in additional functionality, those costs are expensed as incurred. If different determinations are made with respect to whether upgrades or enhancements to software projects would result in additional functionality, then the amount capitalized and the amount charged to expense for that project could differ materially.
148
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
We amortize capitalized costs with respect to development projects for internal-use software when the software is ready for use. The capitalized software development costs are generally amortized using the straight-line method over a 
3
 to 
5
 year period. In determining and reassessing the estimated useful life over which the cost incurred for the software should be amortized, we consider the effects of obsolescence, technology, competition and other economic factors. If different determinations are made with respect to the estimated useful life of the software, the amount of amortization charged in a particular period could differ materially.

As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, our capitalized software development costs were $
283.4
 million and $
250.9
 million, respectively. Our additions relating to capitalized software development costs incurred during Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024 were $
32.3
 million and $
26.1
 million, respectively.
Leases
We enter into operating leases, both domestically and internationally, for certain facilities, automobiles, data centers and equipment for use in the ordinary course of business. During Fiscal 2023, as part of the Micro Focus Acquisition, we acquired certain finance leases primarily comprised of equipment leases, all of which are sublet. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
In accordance with ASC Topic 842, “Leases” (Topic 842), we account for a contract as a lease when we have the right to direct the use of the asset for a period of time while obtaining substantially all of the asset’s economic benefits. We determine the initial classification and measurement of our right of use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement date and thereafter if modified.
ROU assets represent our right to control the underlying assets under lease, and the lease liability is our obligation to make the lease payments related to the underlying assets under lease, over the contractual term. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the present value of future minimum lease payments to be made over the lease term. When available, we will use the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value. However, real estate leases generally do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate, therefore, we must estimate our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments. We estimate our incremental borrowing rate based on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, in an economic environment where the leased asset is located.
The ROU asset equals the lease liability, adjusted for any initial direct costs, prepaid rent and lease incentives on initial recognition. Fixed lease costs are included in the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities. Variable lease costs are not included in the measurement of the lease liability. These variable lease payments are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Lease expense for minimum lease payments continues to be recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We have not elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components in the determination of lease costs for our facility leases. For all other asset classes, we have elected the practical expedient to combine the lease and the non-lease components. The lease liability includes lease payments related to options to extend or renew the lease term only if we are reasonably certain we will exercise those options. Our leases typically do not contain any material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. In certain circumstances, we sublease all or a portion of a leased facility to various other companies through a sublease agreement.
Business combinations
We apply the provisions of ASC Topic 805, “Business Combinations” (Topic 805), in the accounting for our acquisitions. It requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities, including contingent consideration where applicable, assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement, particularly since these assumptions and estimates are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill in the period identified. Furthermore, when valuing certain intangible assets that we have acquired, critical estimates may be made relating to, but not limited to: (i) future expected cash flows from software license sales, cloud SaaS, “desktop as a service” (DaaS) and PaaS contracts, support agreements, consulting agreements and other customer contracts (ii) the acquired company’s technology and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time that the acquired technology will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio, and (iii) discount rates. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments would be recorded to our Consolidated Statements of Income.
149
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
For a given acquisition, we may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as a part of the purchase price allocation and, if so, to determine the estimated amounts.
If we determine that a pre-acquisition contingency (non-income tax related) is probable in nature and estimable as of the acquisition date, we record our best estimate for such a contingency as a part of the preliminary purchase price allocation. We often continue to gather information and evaluate our pre-acquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period and if we make changes to the amounts recorded or if we identify additional pre-acquisition contingencies during the measurement period, such amounts will be included in the purchase price allocation during the measurement period and, subsequently, in our results of operations.
Uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date. We review these items during the measurement period as we continue to actively seek and collect information relating to facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. Changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances made subsequent to the measurement period, or if they relate to facts and circumstances that did not exist at the acquisition date, are recorded in the Provision for income taxes line of our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill is periodically reviewed for impairment (at a minimum annually) and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of this asset may not be recoverable.
Our operations are analyzed by management and our chief operating decision maker (CODM) as being part of a single industry segment: the design, development, marketing and sales of Information Management software and solutions. Therefore, our goodwill impairment assessment is based on the allocation of goodwill to a single reporting unit.
We perform a qualitative assessment to test our reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment. Based on our qualitative assessment, if we determine that the fair value of our reporting unit is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50 percent) to be less than its carrying amount, the quantitative assessment of the impairment test is performed. In the quantitative assessment, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then an impairment loss equal to the difference, but not exceeding the total carrying value of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit, would be recorded.
Our annual impairment analysis of goodwill was performed as of April 1, 2025. Our qualitative assessment indicated that there were no indications of impairment and therefore there was 
no
 impairment of goodwill required to be recorded for Fiscal 2025 (
no
 impairments were recorded for Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023, respectively).
Acquired intangibles
Acquired intangibles consist of acquired technology and customer relationships associated with various acquisitions. Acquired technology is initially recorded at fair value based on the present value of the estimated net future income-producing capabilities of software products acquired in acquisitions. We amortize acquired technology on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.
Customer relationships represent relationships that we have with customers of the acquired companies and are either based upon contractual or legal rights or are considered separable; that is, capable of being separated from the acquired entity and being sold, transferred, licensed, rented or exchanged. These customer relationships are initially recorded at their fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows. We amortize customer relationships on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
We continually evaluate the remaining estimated useful life of our intangible assets being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization.
Impairment of long-lived assets
We account for the impairment and disposition of long-lived assets in accordance with ASC Topic 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment” (Topic 360). We test long-lived assets or asset groups, such as property and equipment, ROU assets and definite lived intangible assets, for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a 
150
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life.
Recoverability is assessed based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the aggregate pre-tax undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group. Impairment is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group. The impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value, which for this purpose is based upon the discounted projected future cash flows of the asset or asset group.
We have 
no
t recorded any significant impairment charges for long-lived assets during Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023, respectively.
Derivative financial instruments
We use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency rate risk. We account for these instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815, “Derivatives and Hedging” (Topic 815), which requires that every derivative instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value as of the reporting date. Topic 815 also requires that changes in our derivative financial instruments’ fair values be recognized in earnings; unless specific hedge accounting and documentation criteria are met (i.e., the instruments are accounted for as hedges). We recorded the effective portions of the gain or loss on derivative financial instruments that were designated as cash flow hedges in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any ineffective or excluded portion of a designated cash flow hedge, if applicable, was recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
In Fiscal 2023, we entered into certain derivative financial instruments, a portion of which were designated as a net investment hedge. In accordance with Topic 815, we recorded the effective portion of the gain or loss on derivative financial instruments that were designated as a net investment hedge within our currency translation adjustment component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), in our accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any ineffective or excluded portion of our net investment hedge, if applicable, is recognized in Interest and other related expense, net of our Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for more details.
Asset retirement obligations
We account for asset retirement obligations in accordance with ASC Topic 410, “Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations” (Topic 410), which applies to certain obligations associated with “leasehold improvements” within our leased office facilities. Topic 410 requires that a liability be initially recognized for the estimated fair value of the obligation when it is incurred. The associated asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset and depreciated over the remaining life of the underlying asset and the associated liability is accreted to the estimated fair value of the obligation at the settlement date through periodic accretion charges which are generally recorded within General and administrative expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. When the obligation is settled, any difference between the final cost and the recorded amount is recognized as income or loss on settlement in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Revenue recognition
In accordance with ASC Topic 606, we account for a customer contract when we obtain written approval, the contract is committed, the rights of the parties, including the payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of collection. Revenue is recognized when, or as, control of a promised product or service is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for our products and services (at its transaction price). Estimates of variable consideration and the determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on readily available information, which may include historical, current and forecasted information, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and specific facts and circumstances of each arrangement. We report revenue net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue producing transactions. 
We have 
four
 revenue streams: cloud services and subscriptions, customer support, license, and professional service and other.
Cloud services and subscriptions revenue
Cloud services and subscriptions revenue are from hosting arrangements where in connection with the licensing of software, the end user does not take possession of the software, as well as from end-to-end fully outsourced B2B integration solutions to our customers (collectively referred to as cloud arrangements). The software application resides on our hardware or that of a third-party, and the customer accesses and uses the software on an as-needed basis. Our cloud arrangements can be broadly categorized as PaaS, SaaS, cloud subscriptions and managed services.
151
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
PaaS/ SaaS/ Cloud Subscriptions (collectively referred to here as cloud-based solutions):
 We offer cloud-based solutions that provide customers the right to access our software through the internet. Our cloud-based solutions represent a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. These services are made available to the customer continuously throughout the contractual period. However, the extent to which the customer uses the services may vary at the customer’s discretion. The payment for cloud-based solutions may be received either at inception of the arrangement, or over the term of the arrangement.
These cloud-based solutions are considered to have a single performance obligation where the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit, and as such we recognize revenue for these cloud-based solutions ratably over the term of the contractual agreement. For example, revenue related to cloud-based solutions that are provided on a usage basis, such as the number of users, is recognized based on a customer’s utilization of the services in a given period.
Additionally, a software license is present in a cloud-based solutions arrangement if all of the following criteria are met:
(i)
The customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time without significant penalty; and
(ii)
It is feasible for the customer to host the software independent of us.
In these cases where a software license is present in a cloud-based solutions arrangement it is assessed to determine if it is distinct from the cloud-based solutions arrangement. The revenue allocated to the distinct software license would be recognized at the point in time the software license is transferred to the customer, whereas the revenue allocated to the hosting performance obligation would be recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the contractual term unless evidence suggests that revenue is earned, or obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern over the contractual term of the arrangement.
Managed services:
 We provide comprehensive B2B process outsourcing services for all day-to-day operations of a customers’ B2B integration program. Customers using these managed services are not permitted to take possession of our software and the contract is for a defined period, where customers pay a monthly or quarterly fee. Our performance obligation is satisfied as we provide services of operating and managing a customer’s electronic data interchange (EDI) environment. Revenue relating to these services is recognized using an output method based on the expected level of service we will provide over the term of the contract. 
As part of cloud services and subscriptions revenues, in connection with cloud subscription and managed service contracts, we often agree to perform a variety of services before the customer goes live, such as, converting and migrating customer data, building interfaces and providing training. These services are considered an outsourced suite of professional services which can involve certain project-based activities. These services can be provided at the initiation of a contract, during the implementation or on an ongoing basis as part of the customer life cycle. These services can be charged separately on a fixed fee or time and materials basis, or the costs associated may be recovered as part of the ongoing cloud subscription or managed services fee. These outsourced professional services are considered to be distinct from the ongoing hosting services and represent a separate performance obligation within our cloud subscription or managed services arrangements. The obligation to provide outsourced professional services is satisfied over time, with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits as we satisfy our performance obligations. For outsourced professional services, we recognize revenue by measuring progress toward the satisfaction of our performance obligation. Progress for services that are contracted for a fixed price is generally measured based on hours incurred as a portion of total estimated hours. As a practical expedient, when we invoice a customer at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance to date, we recognize revenue at that amount.
Customer support revenue
Customer support revenue is associated with perpetual, term license and off-cloud subscription arrangements. As customer support is not critical to the customer’s ability to derive benefit from its right to use our software, customer support is considered as a distinct performance obligation when sold together in a bundled arrangement along with the software. 
Customer support consists primarily of technical support and the provision of unspecified updates and upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. Customer support for perpetual licenses is renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Customer support for term and subscription licenses is renewable concurrently with such licenses for the same duration of time. Payments for customer support are generally made at the inception of the contract term or in installments over the term of the maintenance period. Our customer support team is ready to provide these maintenance services, as needed, to the customer during the contract term. As the elements of customer support are delivered concurrently and have the same pattern of transfer, customer support is accounted for as a single performance obligation. The customer benefits evenly throughout the contract period from the guarantee that the customer support resources and personnel will be available to them, and that any unspecified upgrades or unspecified future products developed by us will be made available. Revenue for customer support is 
152
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
recognized ratably over the contract period based on the start and end dates of the maintenance term, in line with how we believe services are provided.
License revenue
Our license revenue can be broadly categorized as perpetual licenses, term licenses and subscription licenses, all of which are deployed on the customer’s premises (off-cloud). 
Perpetual licenses:
 We sell perpetual licenses which provide customers the right to use software for an indefinite period of time in exchange for a one-time license fee, which is generally paid at contract inception. Our perpetual licenses provide a right to use IP that is functional in nature and have significant stand-alone functionality. Accordingly, for perpetual licenses of functional IP, revenue is recognized at the point-in-time when control has been transferred to the customer, which normally occurs once software activation keys have been made available for download.
Term licenses and Subscription licenses: 
We sell both term and subscription licenses which provide customers the right to use software for a specified period in exchange for a fee, which may be paid at contract inception or paid in installments over the period of the contract. Like perpetual licenses, both our term licenses and subscription licenses are functional IP that have significant stand-alone functionality. Accordingly, for both term and subscription licenses, revenue is recognized at the point-in-time when the customer is able to use and benefit from the software, which is normally once software activation keys have been made available for download at the commencement of the term.
Professional service and other revenue
Our professional services, when offered along with software licenses, consist primarily of technical services and training services. Technical services may include installation, customization, implementation or consulting services. Training services may include access to online modules or delivering a training package customized to the customer’s needs. At the customer’s discretion, we may offer one, all, or a mix of these services. Payment for professional services is generally a fixed fee or is a fee based on time and materials. Professional services can be arranged in the same contract as the software license or in a separate contract. 
As our professional services do not significantly change the functionality of the license and our customers can benefit from our professional services on their own or together with other readily available resources, we consider professional services as distinct within the context of the contract. 
Professional service revenue is recognized over time as long as: (i) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as we perform them, (ii) our performance creates or enhances an asset the customer controls as we perform, and (iii) our performance does not create an asset with alternative use and we have enforceable right to payment. 
If all the above criteria are met, we use an input-based measure of progress for recognizing professional service revenue. For example, we may consider total labour hours incurred compared to total expected labour hours. As a practical expedient, when we invoice a customer at an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance to date, we will recognize revenue at that amount.
Material rights
To the extent that we grant our customer an option to acquire additional products or services in one of our arrangements, we will account for the option as a distinct performance obligation in the contract only if the option provides a material right to the customer that the customer would not receive without entering into the contract. For example, if we give the customer an option to acquire additional goods or services in the future at a price that is significantly lower than the current price, this would be a material right as it allows the customer to, in effect, pay in advance for the option to purchase future products or services. If a material right exists in one of our contracts, then revenue allocated to the option is deferred and we would recognize revenue only when those future products or services are transferred or when the option expires. 
Based on history, our contracts do not typically contain material rights and when they do, the material right is not significant to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Arrangements with multiple performance obligations
Our contracts generally contain more than one of the products and services listed above. Determining whether goods and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or as a single performance obligation may require judgment, specifically when assessing whether both of the following two criteria are met: 
•
the customer can benefit from the product or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer; and 
153
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
•
our promise to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. 
If these criteria are not met, we determine an appropriate measure of progress based on the nature of our overall promise for the single performance obligation. 
If these criteria are met, each product or service is separately accounted for as a distinct performance obligation and the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative SSP basis.
Standalone selling price
The SSP reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In most cases we can establish the SSP based on observable data. We typically establish a narrow SSP range for our products and services and assess this range on a periodic basis or when material changes in facts and circumstances warrant a review. 
If the SSP is not directly observable, then we estimate the amount using either the expected cost plus a margin or residual approach. Estimating SSP requires judgment that could impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized. SSP is a formal process whereby management considers multiple factors including, but not limited to, geographic or regional specific factors, competitive positioning, internal costs, profit objectives, and pricing practices.
Transaction Price Allocation
In bundled arrangements, where we have more than one distinct performance obligation, we must allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its relative SSP. However, in certain bundled arrangements, the SSP may not always be directly observable. For instance, in bundled arrangements with license and customer support, we allocate the transaction price between the license and customer support performance obligations using the residual approach because we have determined that the SSP for licenses in these arrangements are highly variable. We use the residual approach only for our license arrangements. When the SSP is observable but contractual pricing does not fall within our established SSP range, then an adjustment is required, and we will allocate the transaction price between license and customer support based on the relative SSP established for the respective performance obligations. 
When two or more contracts are entered into at or near the same time with the same customer, we evaluate the facts and circumstances associated with the negotiation of those contracts. Where the contracts are negotiated as a package, we will account for them as a single arrangement and allocate the consideration for the combined contracts among the performance obligations accordingly.
Sales to resellers
We execute certain sales contracts through resellers, distributors and channel partners (collectively referred to as resellers). Typically, we conclude that the resellers are OpenText customers in our reseller agreements. The resellers have control over the pricing, service and products prior to being transferred to the end customer. We also assess the creditworthiness of each reseller and if they are newly formed, undercapitalized or in financial difficulty, we defer any revenues expected to emanate from such reseller and recognize revenue only when cash is received, and all other revenue recognition criteria under ASC Topic 606 are met.
Rights of return and other incentives
We do not generally offer rights of return or any other incentives such as concessions, product rotation, or price protection and, therefore, do not provide for or make estimates of rights of return and similar incentives. However, we do offer consumers who purchase certain of our products online directly from us an unconditional full 70-day money-back guarantee. Distributors and resellers are also permitted to return the consumer products, subject to certain limitations. Revenue is reduced for such rights based on the estimate of future returns originating from contractual agreements with these customers. 
Additionally, in some contracts, however, discounts may be offered to the customer for future software purchases and other additional products or services. Such arrangements grant the customer an option to acquire additional goods or services in the future at a discount and therefore are evaluated under guidance related to “material rights” as discussed above.
Other policies
Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 
30
 to 
60
 days of the invoice date. In certain arrangements, we will receive payment from a customer either before or after the performance obligation to which the invoice relates has been satisfied. As a practical expedient, we do not account for significant financing components if the period between when we transfer the promised good or service to the customer and 
154
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
when the customer pays for the product or service will be one year or less. On that basis, our contracts for license and maintenance typically do not contain a significant financing component, however, in determining the transaction price we consider whether we need to adjust the promised consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides either the customer or OpenText with a significant benefit of financing. Our managed services contracts may not include an upfront charge for outsourced professional services performed as part of an implementation and are recovered through an ongoing fee. Therefore, these contracts may be expected to have a financing component associated with revenue being recognized in advance of billings. 
We may modify contracts to offer customers additional products or services. The additional products and services will be considered distinct from those products or services transferred to the customer before the modification and will be accounted for as a separate contract. We evaluate whether the price for the additional products and services reflects the SSP adjusted as appropriate for facts and circumstances applicable to that contract. In determining whether an adjustment is appropriate, we evaluate whether the incremental consideration is consistent with the prices previously paid by the customer or similar customers. 
Certain of our subscription services and product support arrangements generally contain performance response time guarantees. For subscription services arrangements, we estimate variable consideration using a portfolio approach because performance penalties are tied to standard response time requirements. For product support arrangements, we estimate variable consideration on a contract basis because such arrangements are customer specific. For both subscription services and product support arrangements, we use an expected value approach to estimate variable consideration based on historical business practices and current and future performance expectations to determine the likelihood of incurring penalties.

Incremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract with a Customer
Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that we incur to obtain a contract that we would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained, such as sales commissions. We have determined that certain of our commission programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Some commission programs are not subject to capitalization as the commission expense is paid and recognized as the related revenue is recognized. In assessing costs to obtain a contract, we apply a practical expedient that allows us to assess our incremental costs on a portfolio of contracts with similar characteristics instead of assessing the incremental costs on each individual contract. We do not expect the financial statement effects of applying this practical expedient to the portfolio of contracts to be materially different than if we were to apply the standard to each individual contract. 
We pay commissions on the sale of new customer contracts as well as for renewals of existing contracts to the extent the renewals generate incremental revenue. Commissions paid on renewal contracts are limited to the incremental new revenue and therefore these payments are not commensurate with the commission paid on the original sale. We allocate commission costs to the performance obligations in an arrangement consistent with the allocation of the transaction price. Commissions allocated to the license performance obligation are expensed at the time the license revenue is recognized. Commissions allocated to professional service performance obligations are expensed as incurred, as these contracts are generally for one year or less and we apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred if the amortization period would have been one year or less. Commissions allocated to maintenance, managed services, on-going hosting arrangements or other recurring services, are capitalized and amortized consistent with the pattern of transfer to the customer of the services over the period expected to 
155
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
benefit from the commission payment. As commissions paid on renewals are not commensurate with the original sale, the period of benefit considers anticipated renewals. The benefit period is estimated to be approximately 
six years
, which is based on our customer contracts and the estimated life of our technology. 
Expenses for incremental costs associated with obtaining a contract are recorded within Sales and marketing expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Our short-term capitalized costs to obtain a contract are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets, while our long-term capitalized costs to obtain a contract are included in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Research and development costs
Research and development costs internally incurred in creating computer software to be sold, licensed or otherwise marketed are expensed as incurred unless they meet the criteria for deferral and amortization, as described in ASC Topic 985-20, “Costs of Software to be Sold, Leased, or Marketed” (Topic 985-20). In accordance with Topic 985-20, costs related to research, design and development of products are charged to expense as incurred and capitalized between the dates that the product is considered to be technologically feasible and is considered to be ready for general release to customers. In our historical experience, the dates relating to the achievement of technological feasibility and general release of the product have substantially coincided. In addition, no significant costs are incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility. As a result, we do not capitalize any research and development costs relating to internally developed software to be sold, licensed or otherwise marketed.
Advertising Expenses
Advertising costs, which include digital advertising, marketing programs and other promotional costs, are expensed as incurred.
 Advertising expenses incurred in Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 were $
64.8
 million, $
66.9
 million and $
73.8
 million, respectively.
Income taxes
We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes” (Topic 740). Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. These temporary differences are measured using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent that we consider it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In determining the valuation allowance, we consider factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected taxable income, and the character of income tax assets and tax planning strategies. A change to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense.
We account for our uncertain tax provisions by using a two-step approach. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of the available evidence indicates it is more likely than not, based solely on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained on audit, including the resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the appropriate amount of the benefit to recognize. The amount of benefit to recognize is measured as the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be realized. The tax position is derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit. On subsequent recognition and measurement, the maximum amount which is more likely than not to be recognized at each reporting date will represent the Company’s best estimate, given the information available at the reporting date, although the outcome of the tax position is not absolute or final. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties related to liabilities for income taxes within the Provision for income taxes line of our Consolidated Statements of Income
 (see Note 15 “Income Taxes” for more details).
Equity investments
We invest in investment funds in which we are a limited partner. Our interests in each of these investees range from 
4
% to below 
20
%. These investments are accounted for using the equity method. Our share of net income or losses based on our interest in these investments, which approximates fair value, is recorded as a component of Other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income
 (see Note 23 “Other Income (Expense), Net” for more details).
Fair value of financial instruments
Carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable (trade and accrued liabilities) approximate the fair value due to the relatively short period of time between origination of the instruments and their expected realization. 
156
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
The fair value of our Senior Notes is determined based on observable market prices and categorized as a Level 2 measurement. The carrying value of our other long-term debt facilities approximates the fair value since the interest rate is at market. 
We apply the provisions of ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurement” (Topic 820), to our available-for-sale financial assets and derivative financial instruments that we are required to carry at fair value pursuant to other accounting standards
 (see Note 16 “Fair Value Measurement” for more details).
Foreign currency
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in U.S. dollars. In general, the functional currency of our subsidiaries is the local currency. For each subsidiary, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the previous month of the transaction. The effect of foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
 Transactional foreign currency gains (losses) included in the Consolidated Statements of Income under the line item Other income (expense), net for Fiscal 2025, Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 were $(
24.9
) million, $
1.2
 million, and $
56.6
 million, respectively.
Restructuring charges
We record restructuring charges relating to contractual lease obligations, not accounted for under Topic 842, and other exit costs in accordance with ASC Topic 420, “Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations” (Topic 420). Topic 420 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. In order to incur a liability pursuant to Topic 420, our management must have established and approved a plan of restructuring in sufficient detail. A liability for a cost associated with involuntary termination benefits is recorded when benefits have been communicated and a liability for a cost to terminate an operating lease or other contract is incurred, when the contract has been terminated in accordance with the contract terms or we have ceased using the right conveyed by the contract, such as vacating a leased facility not accounted for under Topic 842. 
The recognition of restructuring charges requires us to make certain judgments regarding the nature, timing and amount associated with the planned restructuring activities, including estimating sub-lease income and the net recoverable amount of equipment to be disposed of. At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the appropriateness of the remaining accrued balances
 (see Note 18 “Special Charges (Recoveries)” for more details).
Loss Contingencies
We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. Quarterly, we review the status of each significant legal matter and evaluate such matters to determine how they should be treated for accounting and disclosure purposes in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 450-20, “Loss Contingencies” (Topic 450-20). Specifically, this evaluation process includes the centralized tracking and itemization of the status of all our disputes and litigation items, discussing the nature of any litigation and claim, including any dispute or claim that is reasonably likely to result in litigation, with relevant internal and external counsel, and assessing the progress of each matter in light of its merits and our experience with similar proceedings under similar circumstances. 
If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with Topic 450-20. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the aggregate of such accrued liabilities was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations and we do not believe as of the date of this filing that it is reasonably possible that a loss exceeding the amounts already recognized will be incurred that would be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. As described more fully below, we are unable at this time to estimate a possible loss or range of losses in respect of certain disclosed matters
 (see Note 14 “Guarantees and Contingencies” for more details).
Net income per share
Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding including contingently issuable shares where the contingency has been resolved. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of Common Shares and stock equivalents outstanding using the treasury stock method during the year. For periods in which we incur a net loss, our outstanding Common Share equivalents are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share as their effect is antidilutive. Accordingly, basic and diluted net loss per share for those periods are identical.
 See Note 24 “Earnings Per Share” for more details.

Share-based compensation
We measure share-based compensation costs, in accordance with ASC Topic 718, “Compensation - Stock Compensation” (Topic 718) on the grant date, based on the calculated fair value of the award. We have elected to treat awards with graded vesting as a single award when estimating fair value. Compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employee requisite service period, which in our circumstances is the stated vesting period of the award, provided that total compensation cost recognized at least equals the pro-rata value of the award that has vested. Compensation cost is initially based on the estimated number of options for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered. This estimate is adjusted in the period once actual forfeitures are known
 (see Note 13 “Equity and Share-based Compensation” for more details).
Accounting for Pensions, post-retirement and post-employment benefits
Pension expense is accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 715, “Compensation-Retirement Benefits” (Topic 715). Pension expense consists of actuarially computed costs of pension benefits in respect of the current year of service, imputed returns on plan assets (for funded plans), imputed interest on pension obligations and amortization of actuarial gain/loss. The expected costs of post-retirement benefits, other than pensions, are accrued in the Consolidated Financial Statements based upon actuarial methods and assumptions.
The over-funded or under-funded status of defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans are recognized as an asset or a liability (with the offset to Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, within Shareholders’ equity), respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Actuarial gains or losses in excess of the greater of (i) 10% of the projected benefit obligation, or (ii) 10% of the plan assets, are recognized as a component of Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), net and subsequently amortized as a component of net periodic benefit costs over the weighted average of future working life of the plan’s active employees.
 See Note 12 “Pension Plans and Other Post-Retirement Benefits” for more details.
Held for Sale Classification
Assessments for held for sale accounting classification are performed by the Company when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that a change in classification may be necessary. The Company classifies assets and liabilities to be disposed of as held for sale in the period in which they are available for immediate sale in their present condition and when the sale is probable and expected to be completed within one year. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately within current assets and liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Further, the Company ceases to record depreciation and amortization expense on assets that are classified as held for sale.
Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in Fiscal 2025
During Fiscal 2025, we adopted the following Accounting Standards Updates (ASU):
Segment Reporting
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” which provides guidance to improve the disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments and address requests from investors for additional, more detailed information about a reportable segment’s expenses. We adopted this ASU for our annual period beginning July 1, 2024 on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this ASU expanded our disclosures, but did not have an impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 20 “Segment Information” for additional information.
Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted in Fiscal 2025
Income Taxes
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” that addresses requests for improved income tax disclosures from investors that use the financial statements to make capital allocation decisions. Public entities must adopt the new guidance for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The amendments in this ASU must be applied on a retrospective basis to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of ASU 2023-09 on the Company’s financial disclosures.

Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 “Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (Subtopic 220-40),” which requires additional disclosures of specific expense categories included within income statement expense captions. The guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. The amendments in this ASU are to be applied on a prospective basis with the option for retrospective application, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2024-03 on the Company’s financial disclosures.

Contract Balances
A contract asset, net of allowance for credit losses, will be recorded if we have recognized revenue but do not have an unconditional right to the related consideration from the customer. For example, this will be the case if implementation services offered in a cloud arrangement are identified as a separate performance obligation and are provided to a customer prior to us being able to bill the customer. In addition, a contract asset may arise in relation to subscription licenses if the license revenue that is recognized upfront exceeds the amount that we are able to invoice the customer at that time. Contract assets are reclassified to accounts receivable when the rights become unconditional.

 million) of contract assets to receivables as a result of the right to the transaction consideration becoming unconditional. During the year ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023 respectively, there was 
no
 significant impairment loss recognized related to contract assets.
We recognize deferred revenue when we have received consideration, or an amount of consideration is due from the customer for future obligations to transfer products or services. Our deferred revenues primarily relate to cloud services and customer support agreements which have been paid for by customers prior to the performance of those services. The amount of revenue that was recognized during the year ended June 30, 2025 that was included in the deferred revenue balances at June 30, 2024 was $
1.5
 billion (year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 —$
1.7
 billion and $
887
 million, respectively).
Incremental Costs of Obtaining a Contract with a Customer
Incremental costs of obtaining a contract include only those costs that we incur to obtain a contract that we would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained, such as sales commissions. The following table summarizes the changes in total capitalized costs to obtain a contract, since June 30, 2022:

Remaining Performance Obligations
Remaining performance obligations (RPO) represent contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized. They include amounts recognized as deferred revenue and amounts that are contracted but will be billed and recognized as revenue in future periods. 
Beginning December 31, 2024, the Company elected to include RPO for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less in accordance with ASC 606-10-50-14, and discontinued use of the practical expedient relating to the disclosure of RPO within a contract. The Company believes this presentation is preferable as it provides additional information. 
The following chart provides RPO information as of the following periods.

The 12-month periods noted below are as of the dates presented, with the remaining balances recognized substantially over the next three years thereafter.

LEASES
We enter into operating leases, both domestically and internationally, for certain facilities, automobiles, data centers and equipment for use in the ordinary course of business. The duration of the majority of these leases generally ranges from 
1
 to 
10
 years, some of which include options to extend for an additional 
3

5
 years after the initial term. Additionally, the land upon which our headquarters in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada is located is leased from the University of Waterloo for a period of 
49
 years beginning in December 2005, with an option to renew for an additional term of 
49
 years. We also have finance lease liabilities comprised of equipment lease arrangements with an average duration of

Deposits and restricted cash primarily relate to security deposits provided to landlords in accordance with facility lease agreements and cash restricted per the terms of certain contractual-based agreements.
Capitalized costs to obtain a contract relate to incremental costs of obtaining a contract, such as sales commissions, which are eligible for capitalization on contracts to the extent that such costs are expected to be recovered (see Note 3 “Revenues”). 
Investments relate to certain investment funds in which we are a limited partner. Our interests in each of these investees range from 
4
% to below 
20
%. These investments are accounted for using the equity method. Our share of net income or losses based on our interest in these investments, which approximates fair value and is subject to volatility based on market trends and business conditions, is recorded as a component of Other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income (see Note 23 “Other Income (Expense), Net”). During the year ended June 30, 2025, our share of income (loss) from these investments was $
0.2
 million (year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 — $(

A portion of the available-for-sale financial assets relate to contractual arrangements under insurance policies held by the Company with guaranteed interest rates that are utilized to meet certain pension and post-retirement obligations but do not meet the definition of a plan asset. The remaining portion of available-for-sale financial assets are primarily comprised of various

debt and equity funds, which are valued utilizing market quotes provided by our third-party custodian. These arrangements are treated as available-for-sale financial assets measured at fair value quarterly (see Note 16 “Fair Value Measurement” with unrealized gains and losses recorded within Other comprehensive income (loss), net (see Note 21 “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)”).
Prepaid expenses and other assets, both short-term and long-term, include advance payments on licenses that are being amortized over the applicable terms of the licenses and other miscellaneous assets.

Senior Secured Fixed Rate Notes
Senior Secured Notes 2027
On December 1, 2022, the Company issued $
1
 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2027 (Senior Secured Notes 2027, and together with the Senior Notes 2031, Senior Notes 2030, Senior Notes 2029, and Senior Notes 2028, the Senior Notes) in connection with the Micro Focus Acquisition in an unregistered offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. Senior Secured Notes 2027 bear interest at a rate of

The Senior Secured Notes 2027 are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries, and are secured with the same priority as the Company’s senior credit facilities. The Senior Secured Notes 2027 and the related guarantees are effectively senior to all of the Company’s and the guarantors’ senior unsecured debt to the extent of the value of the Collateral (as defined in the indenture to the Senior Secured Notes 2027) and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of each of the Company’s existing and future subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes 2027. As of June 30, 2025, the Senior Secured Notes 2027 bear an effective interest rate of 
7.39
%. The effective interest rate includes interest expense of $
69.0
 million and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $
2.9
 million.
For the year ended June 30, 2025, we recorded interest expense of $

 million, relating to Senior Secured Notes 2027 (year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023—$
69.0
 million and $
40.3
 million, respectively).
Term Loan B
On May 30, 2018, we entered into a credit facility that provided for a $
1
 billion term loan facility (Term Loan B) and borrowed $
1
 billion under the facility to, among other things, repay in full the loans under our prior $
800
 million term loan facility originally entered into on January 16, 2014. On May 6, 2024, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the AMC Divestiture to prepay, in full, the then outstanding principal balance of $
940
 million under Term Loan B, at which point all remaining commitments under Term Loan B were reduced to 
zero
 and Term Loan B was terminated.
For the year ended June 30, 2025, we did 
not
 record any interest expense relating to Term Loan B (year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023—$
58.4
 million and $
54.0
 million, respectively).
Revolver
On December 19, 2023, we amended our committed revolving credit facility (the Revolver) to, among other things, extend the maturity to December 19, 2028. Borrowings under the Revolver are secured by a first charge over substantially all of our assets, on a pari passu basis with the Acquisition Term Loan (as defined below) and Senior Secured Notes 2027.
168
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
The Revolver has no fixed repayment date prior to the end of the term. Borrowings under the Revolver bear interest per annum at a floating rate of interest equal to Term SOFR (as defined in the Revolver) and a fixed margin dependent on our consolidated net leverage ratio ranging from 
1.25
% to 
1.75
%.
Under the Revolver, we must maintain a “consolidated net leverage” ratio of no more than 
4.50
:1.00 at the end of each financial quarter. Consolidated net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of our total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, over our trailing twelve months net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges. As of June 30, 2025, our consolidated net leverage ratio, as calculated in accordance with the applicable agreement, was 
3.25
:1.00.
The Revolver requires us to pay a facility fee on unused commitments based on the consolidated net leverage ratio. As of June 30, 2025, the facility fee under the Revolver was 
0.30
%. For the year ended June 30, 2025, we recorded $
2.3
 million of facility fees in Interest and other related expense, net, in our Consolidated Statements of Income (year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023—$
2.1
 million and $
1.8
 million).
As of June 30, 2025, we had 
no
 outstanding balance under the Revolver (June 30, 2024—
nil
). For the year ended June 30, 2025, we did not record any interest expense relating to the Revolver (year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023—$
2.2
 million and $
10.1
 million, respectively).
Acquisition Term Loan
On December 1, 2022, we amended our first lien term loan facility (the Acquisition Term Loan), dated as of August 25, 2022, to increase the aggregate commitments under the senior secured delayed-draw term loan facility from an aggregate principal amount of $
2.585
 billion to an aggregate principal amount of $
3.585
 billion. On August 14, 2023, we entered into the second amendment to the Acquisition Term Loan, to reduce the applicable interest rate margin by 
0.75
% over the remaining term of the Acquisition Term Loan. On May 15, 2024, we entered into the third amendment to the Acquisition Term Loan, to reduce the applicable interest rate margin by 
0.5
% and remove the 
10
-basis point credit spread adjustment for loans bearing interest based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) rate. On November 27, 2024, we entered into the fourth amendment to the Acquisition Term Loan to reduce the applicable interest rate margin by 
0.5
% over the remaining term of the Acquisition Term Loan. The reductions in interest rate margin on the Acquisition Term Loan resulting from the amendments were all accounted for by the Company as debt modifications.
The Acquisition Term Loan has a 
seven-year
 term from the date of funding, and repayments under the Acquisition Term Loan are equal to 
0.25
% of the principal amount in equal quarterly installments for the life of the Acquisition Term Loan, with the remainder due at maturity. Borrowings under the Acquisition Term Loan currently bear a floating rate of interest equal to Term SOFR (as defined in the Acquisition Term Loan) plus an applicable margin of 
1.75
%. As of June 30, 2025, the outstanding balance on the Acquisition Term Loan bears an interest rate of 
6.08
%. As of June 30, 2025, the Acquisition Term Loan bears an effective interest rate of 
7.12
%. The effective interest rate includes interest expense of $
148.4
 million and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs of $
14.7
 million.
The Acquisition Term Loan has incremental facility capacity of (i) $
250
 million plus (ii) additional amounts, subject to meeting a “consolidated senior secured net leverage” ratio not exceeding 
2.75
:1.00, in each case subject to certain conditions. Consolidated senior secured net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of the Company’s total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, that is secured by the Company’s or any of the Company’s subsidiaries’ assets, over the Company’s trailing four financial quarter net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges. Under the Acquisition Term Loan, we must maintain a “consolidated net leverage” ratio of no more than 
4.50
:1.00 at the end of each financial quarter. Consolidated net leverage ratio is defined for this purpose as the proportion of the Company’s total debt reduced by unrestricted cash, including guarantees and letters of credit, over the Company’s trailing four financial quarter net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, restructuring, share-based compensation and other miscellaneous charges as defined in the Acquisition Term Loan. As of June 30, 2025, our consolidated net leverage ratio, as calculated in accordance with the applicable agreement, was 
3.25
:1.00.
The Acquisition Term Loan is unconditionally guaranteed by certain subsidiary guarantors, as defined in the Acquisition Term Loan, and is secured by a first charge on substantially all of the assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors on a pari passu basis with the Revolver and the Senior Secured Notes 2027.
On October 20, 2023 and January 22, 2024, the Company made prepayments of $
75
 million and $
175
 million, respectively, on the Acquisition Term Loan using cash on hand. On May 6, 2024, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the AMC Divestiture to prepay $
1.06
 billion of the outstanding principal balance of the Acquisition Term Loan. 
For the year ended June 30, 2025, we recorded interest expense of $
148.4
 million relating to the Acquisition Term Loan (year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023—$
272.5

Debt Discount and Issuance Costs
Debt discount and issuance costs relate primarily to costs incurred for the purpose of obtaining or amending our credit facilities and issuing our Senior Notes, and are being amortized through interest expense over the respective terms of the Senior Notes and Acquisition Term Loan using the effective interest method and straight-line method for the Revolver.
NOTE 12—
PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS
Defined Benefit and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans
The Company has 
45
 pension and other post-retirement plans in multiple countries, including 
30
 defined benefit and other post-retirement benefit plans which were assumed as part of the Micro Focus Acquisition (see Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” for more details). All of our pension and other post-retirement plans are located outside of Canada and the United States. The plans are primarily located in Germany, which, as of June 30, 2025, make up approximately 
49
% of the total net benefit pension obligations.
Our defined benefit pension plans include a mix of final salary type plans which provide for retirement, old age, disability and survivor’s benefits. Final salary type pension plans provide benefits to members either in the form of a lump sum payment or a guaranteed level of pension payable for life in the case of retirement, disability and death. Benefits under our final salary type plans are generally based on the participant’s age, compensation and years of service as well as the social security ceiling and other factors. Many of these plans are closed to new members. The net periodic costs of these plans are determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate and estimated service costs.
Other post-retirement plans include statutory plans that offer termination, indemnity or other end of service benefits. Many of these plans were assumed through our acquisitions or are required by local regulatory and statutory requirements. All of our defined benefit and other post-retirement plans are included in the aggregate projected benefit obligation within Pension liability, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company intends to only make any cash contributions to any defined benefit pension or post-retirement plans where required by the local regulatory or statutory requirements. For the year ended June 30, 2025, we made cash contributions of $
9.2
 million (year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023—$
4.2
 million and $
6.5
 million, respectively). For Fiscal 2026, we expect to make cash contributions of $
9.3
 million to our defined benefit plans.
As part of the Micro Focus Acquisition (see Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” for more details), we assumed a total of 
30
 defined benefit plans, all located outside of Canada and the United States. As of June 30, 2025, these assumed plans carried a net liability of $
38.8
 million and are funded at 
82
% of the defined benefit obligations. Plan assets that partially fund these assumed defined benefit obligations are primarily classified within Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and consist primarily of investments in equity and debt funds. Plan assets exclude insurance contracts with guaranteed interest rates classified as Level 3 available-for-sale financial assets of $
27.4
 million that do not meet the definition of a qualifying insurance policy, as they have not been pledged to the defined benefit and other post-retirement plans (see Note 16 “Fair Value Measurement” for more details). As of June 30, 2025, the fair value of these acquired plan assets was $
182.6
 million.

The Company’s investment objective with respect to its defined benefit plan assets is to achieve an optimal rate of return over the long term while managing an appropriate level of risk to meet adequate future benefit obligations. Plan assets are managed by investment fiduciaries that determine the appropriate asset allocation, risk tolerance, fund diversification and investment strategies to achieve the long-term investment objectives of the plan assets.
In determining the fair value of the defined benefit obligations as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, we used the following weighted-average key assumptions:

 million of our Common Shares on the TSX, the NASDAQ and/or alternative trading systems in Canada and/or the United States, if eligible, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules. On March 13, 2025, the Company increased the authorized limit of the Fiscal 2025 Repurchase Plan by $
150
 million to $
450
 million and established an automatic share purchase plan (ASPP). The price that we were authorized to pay for Common Shares in open market transactions was the market price at the time of purchase or such other price as was permitted by applicable law or stock exchange rules. The Fiscal 2025 Repurchase Plan was effected in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and included a normal course issuer bid to provide means to execute purchases over the TSX.
During the year ended June 30, 2025, we repurchased and cancelled 
14,524,664
 Common Shares for $
418.3
 million, inclusive of 2% Canadian excise taxes recorded (year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023—

 and 
nil
 Common Shares for $
152.3
 million and

, respectively).
Additionally, as of June 30, 2025, we recorded an accrual and a corresponding charge to retained earnings of $
24.8
 million, representing the estimated value of Common Shares expected to be repurchased following the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2025 pursuant to the ASPP.

We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model or, where appropriate, the Monte Carlo pricing model, consistent with the provisions of ASC Topic 718, “Compensation—Stock Compensation” (Topic 718) and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107. The option-pricing models require input of subjective assumptions, including the estimated life of the option and the expected volatility of the underlying stock over the estimated life of the option. We use historical volatility as a basis for projecting the expected volatility of the underlying stock and estimate the expected life of our stock options based upon historical data.
We believe that the valuation techniques and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair value of our stock option grants. Estimates of fair value are not intended, however, to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive equity awards.

Summary of Stock Options and Performance Stock Options
The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the year ended June 30, 2025 was $
0.4
 million (year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023—$
7.0
 million and $
1.8
 million, respectively). For the year ended June 30, 2025, cash in the amount of $
3.7
 million was received as the result of the exercise of options granted under share-based compensation arrangements (year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023—$
31.4
 million and $
7.8
 million, respectively). The tax benefit realized by us during the year ended June 30, 2025 from the exercise of options eligible for a tax deduction was $
0.1
 million (year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023—$
1.5
 million and $
0.3
 million, respectively).
Long-Term Incentive Plans
We incentivize certain eligible employees, in part, with long-term compensation pursuant to our LTIP. The LTIP is a rolling 
three-year
 program that grants eligible employees a certain number of target Performance Share Units (PSUs) and/or Restricted Share Units (RSUs). Target PSUs become vested upon the achievement of certain financial and/or operational performance criteria (the Performance Conditions) that are determined at the time of the grant. The Performance Conditions for vesting of the outstanding PSUs are based on market conditions or performance-based revenue conditions. RSUs are employee service-based awards and vest subject to an eligible employee’s continued employment throughout the applicable vesting period. For the year ended June 30, 2025, we settled LTIP awards that vested by delivering to eligible participants 
350,698
 Common Shares that were purchased in the open market at a cost of $
14.8
 million.
PSUs and RSUs granted under the LTIP have been measured at fair value as of the effective date, consistent with ASC Topic 718, and will be charged to share-based compensation expense over the remaining life of the plan. We estimate the fair value of PSUs with market-based conditions using the Monte Carlo pricing model and RSUs have been valued based upon their grant date fair value. The fair value of PSUs with performance-based conditions have been valued based upon their grant date fair value. Beginning in Fiscal 2023, certain PSU and RSU grants were eligible to receive dividend equivalent units that vest under the same conditions as the underlying grants.
Performance Share Units (Issued Under LTIP)
PSUs (issued under LTIP) vest after 
three years
 from the respective date of grants and upon the achievement of Performance Conditions determined at the time of the grant.

Guarantees and Indemnifications
We have entered into customer agreements which may include provisions to indemnify our customers against third-party claims that our software products or services infringe certain third-party intellectual property rights and for liabilities related to a breach of our confidentiality obligations. We have not made any material payments in relation to such indemnification provisions and have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnification provisions in our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Occasionally, we enter into financial guarantees with third parties in the ordinary course of our business, including, among others, guarantees relating to taxes and letters of credit on behalf of parties with whom we conduct business. Such agreements have not had a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
Litigation
We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings.
Quarterly, we review the status of each significant legal matter and evaluate such matters to determine how they should be treated for accounting and disclosure purposes in accordance with the requirements of ASC Topic 450-20 “Loss Contingencies” (Topic 450-20). Specifically, this evaluation process includes the centralized tracking and itemization of the status of all our disputes and litigation items, discussing the nature of any litigation and claim, including any dispute or claim that is reasonably likely to result in litigation, with relevant internal and external counsel, and assessing the progress of each matter in light of its merits and our experience with similar proceedings under similar circumstances.
If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss in accordance with Topic 450-20. As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the aggregate of such accrued liabilities was not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations and we do not believe as of the date of this filing that it is reasonably possible that a loss exceeding the amounts already recognized will be incurred that would be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. As described more fully below, we are unable at this time to estimate a possible loss or range of losses in respect of certain disclosed matters.
Contingencies
CRA Matter
As part of its ongoing audit of our Canadian tax returns, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has disputed our transfer pricing methodology used for certain intercompany transactions with our international subsidiaries and has issued notices of reassessment for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016. Assuming the utilization of available tax attributes (further described below), we estimate our potential aggregate liability, as of June 30, 2025, in connection with the CRA’s reassessments for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, to be limited to penalties, interest and provincial taxes that may be due of approximately $
86.0
 million. As of June 30, 2025, we have provisionally paid approximately $
32.0
 million in order to fully preserve our rights to object to the CRA’s audit positions, being the minimum 
179
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
payment required under Canadian legislation while the matter is in dispute. This amount is recorded within Long-term income taxes recoverable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2025.
The notices of reassessment for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 would, as drafted, increase our taxable income by approximately $
90
 million to $
100
 million for each of those years, as well as impose a 
10
% penalty on the proposed adjustment to income. Audits by the CRA of our tax returns for fiscal years prior to Fiscal 2012 have been completed with no reassessment of our income tax liability.
We strongly disagree with the CRA's positions and believe the reassessments of Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016 (including any penalties) are without merit, and we are continuing to contest these reassessments. On June 30, 2022, we filed a notice of appeal with the Tax Court of Canada seeking to reverse all such reassessments (including penalties) in full and the customary court process is ongoing.
Even if we are unsuccessful in challenging the CRA's reassessments to increase our taxable income for Fiscal 2012, Fiscal 2013, Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2015 and Fiscal 2016, we have elective deductions available for those years (including carry-backs from later years) that would offset such increased amounts so that no additional cash tax would be payable, exclusive of any assessed penalties and interest, as described above.
The CRA has audited Fiscal 2017, Fiscal 2018, Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2020 on a basis that we strongly disagree with and are contesting. The focus of the CRA audit has been the valuation of certain intellectual property and goodwill when one of our subsidiaries continued into Canada from Luxembourg in July 2016. In accordance with applicable rules, these assets were recognized for tax purposes at fair market value as of that time, which value was supported by an expert valuation prepared by an independent leading accounting and advisory firm. CRA’s position for Fiscal 2017 through Fiscal 2020 relies in significant part on the application of its positions regarding our transfer pricing methodology that are the basis for its reassessment of our fiscal years 2012 to 2016 described above, and that we believe are without merit. Other aspects of CRA’s position for Fiscal 2017 through Fiscal 2020 conflict with the expert valuation prepared by the independent leading accounting and advisory firm that was used to support our original filing position. The CRA issued notices of reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 through Fiscal 2020 on a basis consistent with its proposal to reduce the available depreciable basis of assets in Canada. We have filed notices of objection to the reassessments for each of these years. If we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position, the estimated impact of the proposed adjustment could result in us recording an income tax expense, with no immediate cash payment, to reduce the stated value of our deferred tax assets of up to approximately $
470
 million. Any such income tax expense could also have a corresponding cash tax impact that would primarily occur over a period of several future years based upon annual income realization in Canada. We strongly disagree with the CRA’s position for Fiscal 2017 through Fiscal 2020 and intend to vigorously defend our original filing position. We are not required to provisionally pay any cash amounts to the CRA as a result of the reassessment in respect of Fiscal 2017 through Fiscal 2019 due to utilization of available tax attributes; however, for Fiscal 2020 and, to the extent the CRA reassesses subsequent fiscal years on a similar basis, we may be required to make certain minimum payments required under Canadian legislation on a provisional basis while the matter remains in dispute.
We will continue to vigorously contest the adjustments to our taxable income and any penalty and interest assessments, as well as any reduction to the basis of our depreciable property. We are confident that our original tax filing positions were appropriate. Accordingly, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not recorded any accruals in respect of these reassessments or proposed reassessment in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

______________________
(1)
The decrease in valuation allowance in Fiscal 2025 relates to the recognition of assets previously not recognized as compared to the increase in valuation allowance in Fiscal 2024 due to assets no longer meeting the recognition criteria as a result of the AMC Divestiture.
(2)
Fiscal 2025 benefit primarily relates to statute of limitation expirations as compared to Fiscal 2024.
(3)
The change in foreign tax credits and U.S. BEAT in Fiscal 2025, compared to Fiscal 2024, is primarily driven by the AMC Divestiture.
(4)
The benefit in the current year is related to book to tax filing adjustments for Fiscal 2024 and prior years.
(5)
The impact of internal reorganizations in Fiscal 2025 is primarily related to legal entity rationalization activity, as compared to Fiscal 2024 in which significant gains from the AMC Divestiture were recognized.

We believe that sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the realization of certain deferred tax assets that a valuation allowance is required. We continue to evaluate our taxable position quarterly and consider factors by taxing jurisdiction, including but not limited to factors such as estimated taxable income, any historical experience of losses for tax purposes and the future growth of OpenText. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company had a valuation allowance on its domestic and foreign deferred tax assets of $
651.8
 million and $
662.7
 million, respectively. The balance as of June 30, 2025 consisted of $
9.8
 million and $
642.0
 million against the Company’s domestic and foreign deferred tax assets, respectively, which, the Company believes, are not more likely than not to be utilized in future years. The valuation allowance decreased in Fiscal 2025 by $
10.9
 million primarily related to utilization of interest carryovers and expiration of net operating loss carryovers.
The aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits (including interest and penalties) were as follows:

These balances are primarily included within Long-term income taxes payable within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We believe that it is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized tax benefits, as of June 30, 2025, could decrease tax expense in the next 12 months by $
27.3
 million, relating primarily to the expiration of competent authority relief and tax years becoming statute barred for purposes of future tax examinations by local taxing jurisdictions.
We are subject to income tax audits in all major taxing jurisdictions in which we operate. Our four most significant tax jurisdictions are Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany. Our tax filings remain subject to audits by 
183
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
applicable tax authorities for a certain length of time following the tax year to which those filings relate. We currently have income tax audits open in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and other immaterial jurisdictions. The earliest fiscal years open for examination for our major jurisdictions are 2012 for Canada, 2021 for the United States, 2015 for the United Kingdom and 2016 for Germany. On a quarterly basis we assess the status of these examinations and the potential for adverse outcomes to determine the adequacy of the provision for income and other taxes. Statements regarding the Canada audits are included in Note 14 “Guarantees and Contingencies.”
The timing of the resolution of income tax audits is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax audits in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements may or may not result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes. For more information relating to certain income tax audits, refer to Note 14 “Guarantees and Contingencies.”
On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the OBBBA) was enacted, introducing amendments to U.S. tax laws with various effective dates. Key income tax-related provisions of the OBBBA include provisions related to bonus depreciation, research and development expenditures, interest expense deductibility, and revisions to international tax regimes. The Company is currently assessing the future implications of these tax law changes.
As of June 30, 2025, we have recognized a deferred income tax liability of $
20.0
 million (June 30, 2024—$
15.9
 million) on taxable temporary differences related to the undistributed earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries and planned periodic repatriations from certain German subsidiaries, that will be subject to withholding taxes upon distribution. We have not provided for additional foreign withholding taxes or deferred income tax liabilities related to undistributed earnings of all other non-Canadian subsidiaries, since such earnings are considered permanently invested in those subsidiaries or are not subject to withholding taxes. It is not practicable to reasonably estimate the amount of additional deferred income tax liabilities or foreign withholding taxes that may be payable should these earnings be distributed in the future.
State Aid Matter
As of June 30, 2024, the Company had a long-term income tax receivable related to the payment it made in regard to a State Aid charging notice it received as a result of the European Commission’s final decision on its State Aid investigation into the UK’s “Financing Company Partial Exemption” legislation where it concluded that part of the legislation was in breach of the EU State Aid rules. Micro Focus, along with the UK government and certain other UK-based international companies, appealed the decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).
The CJEU’s judgment was handed down on September 19, 2024. The CJEU broadly followed the Advocate General’s opinion, setting aside the judgment of the General Court and annulling the Commission’s ruling. As a result, a refund of the State Aid charging notice, in the amount of $
43.8
 million plus interest of $
4.0
 million, was received in March 2025.
NOTE 16—
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
ASC Topic 820 “Fair Value Measurement” (Topic 820) defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and addresses disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value, in this context, should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity. In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk, including our own credit risk.
In addition to defining fair value and addressing disclosure requirements, Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels which are determined by the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:

•
Level 1—inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.
•
Level 2—inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
184
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
•
Level 3—inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques.
Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value
: 
Our cash and cash equivalents, along with our accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities balances, are measured and recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements at an amount that approximates the fair value (a Level 2 measurement) due to their short maturities. The carrying value of our other long-term debt facilities approximates the fair value since the interest rate is at market. See Note 11 “Long-Term Debt” for further details.
The following table summarizes the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments as of June 30, 2025 and 2024:

Our derivative liabilities and our derivative assets are classified as Level 2 and are comprised of foreign currency forward and swap contracts. Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the derivative instruments, the counterparties to which have high credit ratings, were derived from pricing models including discounted cash flow techniques, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data, as no quoted market prices exist for these instruments. Our discounted cash flow techniques use observable market inputs, such as, where applicable, foreign currency spot and forward rates.
Our available-for-sale financial assets are classified as either Level 2 or Level 3. Our Level 2 available-for-sale financial assets are comprised primarily of various debt and equity funds, which are valued utilizing market quotes provided by our third-party custodian. Our Level 3 available-for-sale financial assets are comprised of insurance contracts which are valued by an external insurance expert by applying a discount rate to the future cash flows and taking into account the fixed interest rate, mortality rates and term of the insurance contracts. See Note 9 “Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets” for further details.
If applicable, we will recognize transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the actual event or change in circumstance occurs. During the year ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, we did not have any transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
We measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. During the year ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, no indications of impairments were identified and therefore no fair value measurements were required.

NOTE 17—
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
Non-designated Hedges
In connection with the Micro Focus Acquisition, in August 2022, we entered into certain derivative transactions to meet certain foreign currency obligations under UK cash confirmation requirements related to the purchase price of the Micro Focus Acquisition, mitigate the risk of foreign currency appreciation in the GBP denominated purchase price and mitigate the risk of foreign currency appreciation in the EUR denominated existing debt held by Micro Focus. We entered into the following derivatives: (i) 
three
 deal-contingent forward contracts, (ii) a non-contingent forward contract, and (iii) EUR/USD cross currency swaps.
The deal-contingent forward contracts had an aggregate notional amount of £
1.475
 billion. The non-contingent forward contract had a notional amount of £
350
 million. The cross currency swaps are comprised of 
5-year
 EUR/USD cross currency swaps with a notional amount of €
690
 million and 
7-year
 EUR/USD cross currency swaps with a notional amount of €
690
 million. On January 7, 2025, we terminated certain of our outstanding 
5-year
 EUR/USD cross currency swaps with an aggregate notional amount of €
138
 million and made a termination payment of approximately $
10.4
 million on January 9, 2025.
These instruments were entered into as economic hedges to mitigate foreign currency risks associated with the Micro Focus Acquisition. The instruments did not initially qualify for hedge accounting at the time they were entered into. In connection with the closing of the Micro Focus Acquisition, the deal-contingent forward and non-deal contingent forward contracts were settled, and we designated the 
7-year
 EUR/USD cross currency swaps as net investment hedges (see further details below). The 
5-year
 EUR/USD cross currency swaps are non-designated and are measured at fair value with changes to fair value being recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income within Other income (expense), net.
Net Investment Hedge
During the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, the Company designated the €
690
 million of 
7-year
 EUR/USD cross currency swaps as net investment hedges in accordance with “Derivatives and Hedging” (Topic 815). The Company utilizes the designated cross currency swaps to protect our EUR-denominated operations against exchange rate fluctuations. 
The Company assesses the hedge effectiveness of its net investment hedges on a quarterly basis utilizing a method based on the changes in spot price. As such, for derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges, changes in fair value of the designated hedging instruments attributable to fluctuations in the foreign currency spot exchange rates are initially recorded as a component of currency translation adjustments included within Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income until the hedged foreign operations are either sold or substantially liquidated.
In accordance with Topic 815 certain components of the designated cross currency swaps relating to counterparty credit risk and forward exchange rates were excluded from the above effectiveness assessment. The fair value of these excluded components will be amortized over the life of the hedging instruments within Interest and other related expense, net within the Consolidated Statements of Income. Additionally, we will record the cash flows related to the periodic interest settlements on the 
7-year
 EUR/USD cross currency swaps within the investing activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Any gains or losses recognized upon settlement of the cross currency swaps will be recorded within the investing activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Cash Flow Hedge
We are engaged in hedging programs with various banks to limit the potential foreign exchange fluctuations incurred on future cash flows relating to a portion of our Canadian dollar payroll expenses. We operate internationally and are therefore exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in the normal course of our business, in particular to changes in the Canadian dollar on account of large costs that are incurred from our centralized Canadian operations, which are denominated in Canadian dollars. As part of our risk management strategy, we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge portions of our payroll exposure with typical maturities of between 
one
 and 
twelve months
. We do not use foreign currency forward contracts for speculative purposes.
We have designated these transactions as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions under Topic 815. As the critical terms of the hedging instrument and of the entire hedged forecasted transaction are the same, in accordance with Topic 815, we 
186
Tab
le 
of
 C
ontents
have been able to conclude that changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged are expected to completely offset at inception and on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, quarterly unrealized gains or losses on the effective portion of these forward contracts have been included within Other comprehensive income (loss), net within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. As of June 30, 2025, the fair value of the contracts is recorded within Prepaid expenses and other current assets within the Consolidated Balance Sheets and represents the net gain before tax effect that is expected to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings within the next twelve months.
As of June 30, 2025, the notional amount of forward contracts we held to sell U.S. dollars in exchange for Canadian dollars was $
93.5
 million (June 30, 2024—$
95.7
 million).

Business Optimization Plan
During the first quarter of Fiscal 2025, we made a strategic decision to align the Company’s workforce to support its growth and innovation plans (the Business Optimization Plan). The Business Optimization Plan charges relate to facility costs and workforce reductions. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2025, the Board approved an expansion of the Business Optimization Plan to complete strategic initiatives, integration and simplification following the Micro Focus acquisition, AMC Divestiture and other growth and innovation plans including the deployment of AI and automation. This expansion includes costs associated with workforce reduction due to automation, centralization and simplification, and corresponding facility costs related to a reduction of our real estate footprint globally. These charges require management to make certain judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of restructuring charges or recoveries. Our estimated liability could change subsequent to its recognition, requiring adjustments to the expense and the liability recorded. On a quarterly basis, we conduct an evaluation of the related liabilities and expenses and revise our assumptions and estimates as appropriate. 
As of June 30, 2025, we expect total costs to be incurred in connection with the Business Optimization Plan to be approximately $
260.0
 million, of which $
127.9
 million was recorded within Special charges (recoveries) within the Consolidated Statements of Income. The entire Business Optimization Plan is expected to be substantially completed by the second quarter of Fiscal 2027.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending restructuring liability for the Business Optimization Plan, which is included within Accounts payable and accrued liabilities

in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, for the year ended June 30, 2025 is shown below.

Micro Focus Acquisition Restructuring Plan
During the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, as part of the Micro Focus Acquisition, we made a strategic decision to implement restructuring activities to reduce our overall workforce and further reduce our real estate footprint around the world (Micro Focus Acquisition Restructuring Plan). The Micro Focus Acquisition Restructuring Plan charges relate to facility costs and workforce reductions. Facility costs include the accelerated amortization associated with the abandonment of right of use assets, the write-off of property and equipment and other related variable lease and exit costs. These charges require management to make certain judgments and estimates regarding the amount and timing of restructuring charges or recoveries. Our estimated liability could change subsequent to its recognition, requiring adjustments to the expense and the liability recorded. On a quarterly basis, we conduct an evaluation of the related liabilities and expenses and revise our assumptions and estimates as appropriate.
Since the inception of the Micro Focus Acquisition Restructuring Plan, $
148.1
 million has been recorded within Special charges (recoveries) within the Consolidated Statements of Income to date. We do not expect to incur any further significant charges relating to the Micro Focus Acquisition Restructuring Plan.

ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES
Fiscal 2024 Divestiture
Divestiture of AMC Business
On May 1, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its AMC business to Rocket Software for $
2.275
 billion in cash before taxes, fees and other adjustments. The results of the AMC business were recorded and presented within our Consolidated Financial Statements during Fiscal 2024 for the period of July 1, 2023 through April 30, 2024. In connection with the sale, a gain of $
429.1
 million was recorded in 
Other income (expense), net
 within our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended June 30, 2024. During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, working capital and other adjustments were finalized, which resulted in a payment of $
11.7
 million, and a decrease to the gain on the AMC Divestiture by $
4.2
 million.
The Company determined that the AMC business did not constitute a component, as its operations and cash flows cannot be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Company’s operations and cash flows due to significant shared costs, therefore, the transaction did not meet the discontinued operations criteria, and the results of operations from the AMC business are presented within Income from operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income up to the date of disposition.
The Company used the net proceeds from the transaction to prepay in full the outstanding principal balances of the Term Loan B and prepay a portion of the outstanding principal balance of the Acquisition Term Loan, as further described in Note 11 “Long-Term Debt.” The Company also agreed to provide certain transition services to Rocket Software following the completion of the divestiture for up to 
24
 months after the closing date of May 1, 2024, which are included in financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These transition service costs are reimbursable by Rocket Software. For Fiscal 2025, we billed Rocket Software $
31.6
 million under the Transition Services Agreement. The transition services were completed as of June 30, 2025.

In connection with the financing of the Micro Focus Acquisition, concurrent with the announcement of the acquisition on August 25, 2022, the Company entered into the Acquisition Term Loan and a now-terminated bridge loan as well as certain derivative transactions. On December 1, 2022, the Company issued and sold $
1
 billion in aggregate principal amount of 
6.90
% Senior Secured Notes 2027, amended the Acquisition Term Loan and terminated its bridge loan. On January 31, 2023, we drew down the entire aggregate principal amount of $
3.585
 billion of the Acquisition Term Loan, net of original issuance discount and other fees, and drew down $
450
 million under the Revolver. We used these proceeds and cash on hand to fund the purchase price consideration and repayment of Micro Focus’ outstanding indebtedness. In conjunction with the closing of the Micro Focus Acquisition, the deal-contingent forward contracts and non-contingent forward contract, as described in Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” were settled.
The results of operations of Micro Focus have been consolidated with those of OpenText beginning February 1, 2023.

The gross amount receivable was $

 million, of which $
9.3
 million of this receivable was expected to be uncollectible.

The goodwill of $
3.4
 billion is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. There is $
67.3
 million of goodwill that is deductible for tax purposes.
(3)
Purchase price allocation adjustments of $
32.1
 million for the year ended June 30, 2024, were primarily driven by changes in other current assets and other liabilities related to adjustments of pre-acquisition other current assets and deferred tax liabilities.
A settlement related to Micro Focus’ securities litigation that was agreed to prior to the Micro Focus Acquisition has been accrued as part of the liabilities assumed. This settlement, which received final court approval and is now resolved, was fully paid from insurance coverage, and therefore a receivable was recognized as part of the assets acquired. During the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, payment was made into escrow by insurers, and therefore both the associated receivable and liability are no longer included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2023. 
Acquisition-related costs for Micro Focus included in Special charges (recoveries) in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended June 30, 2025 were 
nil
 (year ended June 30, 2024 and 2023—$
1.1

NOTE 20—
SEGMENT INFORMATION
ASC Topic 280, “Segment Reporting” (Topic 280), establishes standards for reporting, by public business enterprises, information about operating segments, products and services, geographic areas and major customers. The method of determining what information, under Topic 280, to report is based on the way that an entity organizes operating segments for making operational decisions and how the entity’s management and CODM assess an entity’s financial performance. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and applied the amendments of the ASU to the prior periods presented to conform with current presentation. See Note 2 “Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements” for details on the ASU.
The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer. Our operations are analyzed by the CODM as being part of a single industry segment: the design, development, marketing and sale of Information Management software and solutions. As such, segment revenues and significant segment expenses are as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The CODM uses Net income attributable to OpenText and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), a non-GAAP measure, on a consolidated Company basis to evaluate and measure financial performance and to make key decisions, including those that involve the preparation of financial projections, strategic decisions and allocation of resources. Adjusted EBITDA is defined and calculated as GAAP-based net income, attributable to OpenText, excluding interest income (expense), provision for (recovery of) income taxes, depreciation and amortization of acquired intangible assets, other income (expense), share-based compensation and special charges (recoveries).

NOTE 24—
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income, attributable to OpenText, by the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income, attributable to OpenText, by the shares used in the calculation of basic earnings per share plus the dilutive effect of Common Share equivalents, such as stock options, using the treasury stock method. Common Share equivalents are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share if their effect is anti-dilutive.

NOTE 25—
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Our procedure regarding the approval of any related party transaction requires that the material facts of such transaction be reviewed by the independent members of the Audit Committee and the transaction be approved by a majority of the independent members of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews all transactions in which we are, or will be, a participant and any related party has or will have a direct or indirect interest in the transaction. In determining whether to approve a related party transaction, the Audit Committee generally takes into account, among other facts it deems appropriate, whether the transaction is on terms no less favourable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances; the extent and nature of the related person’s interest in the transaction; the benefits to the Company of the proposed transaction; if applicable, the effects on a director’s independence; and if applicable, the availability of other sources of comparable services or products.
During the year ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, Mr. Stephen Sadler, a member of the Board of Directors, earned

consulting fees from OpenText for assistance with acquisition-related business activities. The fees earned were not material. Mr. Sadler abstained from voting on all transactions from which he would potentially derive consulting fees.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

As part of our quarterly, non-cumulative cash dividend program, we declared, on August 6, 2025, a dividend of $
0.2750
 per Common Share. The record date for this dividend is September 5, 2025 and the payment date is September 19, 2025. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination and discretion of our Board. 
Share Repurchase Plan
On August 6, 2025, the Company renewed its share repurchase plan, pursuant to which we may purchase for cancellation in open market transactions, from time to time over the 
12
 month period commencing on August 12, 2025 until August 11, 2026, if considered advisable, up to an aggregate of $
300
 million of its common shares on the TSX (as part of a Fiscal 2026 NCIB, defined below), the NASDAQ and/or alternative trading systems in Canada and/or the United States, if eligible, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules (the Fiscal 2026 Repurchase Plan). The price that we are authorized to pay for Common Shares in open market transactions is the market price at the time of purchase or such other price as is permitted by applicable law or stock exchange rules. The Fiscal 2026 Repurchase Plan will be effected in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act and includes a normal course issuer bid to provide means to execute purchases over the TSX.
Normal Course Issuer Bid
On August 6, 2025, the Company renewed its normal course issuer bid (the “Fiscal 2026 NCIB”) in order to provide it with a means to execute purchases over the TSX as part of the overall Fiscal 2026 Repurchase Plan.
The TSX approved the Company’s notice of intention to commence the Fiscal 2026 NCIB, pursuant to which the Company may purchase Common Shares over the TSX for the period commencing on August 12, 2025 until August 11, 2026 in accordance with the TSX's normal course issuer bid rules, including that such purchases are to be made at prevailing market prices or as otherwise permitted. Under the rules of the TSX, the maximum number of Common Shares that may be purchased in this period is 
24,906,456
 (representing 
10
% of the Company’s public float calculated in accordance with TSX rules) as of July 31, 2025, and the maximum number of Common Shares that can be purchased on a single day is 
224,146
 Common Shares, which was 
25
% of 
896,585
 (calculated in accordance with TSX rules based on the average daily trading volume for the Common Shares on the TSX for the six months ended July 31, 2025), subject to certain exceptions for block purchases, and subject in any case to the volume and other limitations under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. Further, as part of the NCIB renewal, the Company has established an ASPP with its broker to facilitate repurchases of Common Shares.
