Forward-Looking Statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements or information (forward-looking statements) within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and other applicable securities laws of the United States and Canada, and is subject to the safe harbors created by those provisions. Words such as “anticipates”, “expects”, “intends”, “plans”, “believes”, “seeks”, “estimates”, “may”, “could”, “would”, “might”, “will” and variations of these words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements or information that refer to expectations, beliefs, plans, projections, objectives, performance or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements, and based on our current expectations, forecasts and projections about the operating environment, economies and markets in which we operate. Forward-looking statements reflect our current estimates, beliefs and assumptions, which are based on management’s perception of historic trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors it believes are appropriate in the circumstances. The forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on certain assumptions including the following: (i) countries continuing to implement and enforce existing and additional customs and security regulations relating to the provision of electronic information for imports and exports; (ii) our continued operation of a secure and reliable business network; (iii) the stability of general political, economic and market conditions, including any potential recession and current or threatened tariffs or trade restrictions; (iv) our ability to manage inflation, including increased labour costs associated with attracting and retaining employees and higher interest rates; (v) our continued ability to manage certain foreign currency risk through hedging; (vi) equity and debt markets continuing to provide us with access to capital; (vii) our continued ability to identify, source and finance attractive and executable business combination opportunities, as well as our ability to continue to successfully integrate any such opportunities, including in accordance with the expected timeframe and/or cost budget for such integration; (viii) our continued ability to avoid infringing third-party intellectual property rights; and (ix) our ability to successfully implement our restructuring plans. Management’s estimates, beliefs and assumptions are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies regarding future events and, as such, are subject to change. We can give no assurance that such estimates, beliefs and assumptions will prove to be correct. 
These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks as well as uncertainties, which include (i) the impact of the Russia-Ukraine and Middle East conflicts and other geopolitical disputes on our business; and (ii) those discussed herein and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended June 30, 2025, which are set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The actual results that we achieve may differ materially from any forward-looking statements, which reflect management's current expectations and projections about future results only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements. A number of factors may materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. These factors include, but are not limited to, those set forth in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors”, and forward-looking statements set forth in Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as other documents we file from time to time with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and Canadian securities regulators. Any one of these factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. You should not rely too heavily on the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these forward-looking statements are relevant only as of the date they were made. 
The Company's fiscal year begins on July 1 and ends on June 30. Unless otherwise noted, any reference to a year preceded by the word “Fiscal” refers to the fiscal year ended June 30 of that year. For example, references to “Fiscal 2025” refer to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.
Our Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in U.S. dollars and, unless otherwise indicated, all amounts included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars. Due to rounding, certain totals and subtotals may not foot and certain percentages may not reconcile. References herein to the “Company”, “OpenText”, “we” or “us” refer to Open Text Corporation and, unless context requires otherwise, its subsidiaries.

As part of the ongoing audit of our Canadian tax returns by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), we have received notices of, and are appealing, reassessments for Fiscal 2012 through Fiscal 2020.
