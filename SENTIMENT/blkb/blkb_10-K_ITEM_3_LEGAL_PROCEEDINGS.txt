ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
Our common stock is trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “BLKB.” According to the records of our transfer agent, as of February 18, 2025, there were approximately 101 stockholders of record of our common stock. Because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, this number is not representative of the total number of beneficial owners of our stock. On February 18, 2025, the closing price of our common stock was $70.96.
Stock Performance Graph
The following performance graph shall not be deemed to be “soliciting material” or “filed” or incorporated by reference in future filings with the SEC, or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing. The performance graph compares the performance of our common stock to the Nasdaq Composite Index and the Nasdaq Computer Index. The graph covers the most recent five-year period ended December 31, 2024. The graph assumes that the value of the investment in our common stock and each index was $100.00 at December 31, 2019, and that all dividends are reinvested.
