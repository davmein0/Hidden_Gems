Update on Five Key Operational Initiatives
In early 2023, we outlined five key operational initiatives targeted to drive innovation, bookings growth, revenue expansion and lower costs. During 2024, we continued to execute on these key initiatives.

Product Innovation and Delivery
2
Bookings Growth and Acceleration
3
Transactional Revenue Optimization and Expansion
4
Modernized Approach to Pricing and Multi-Year Customer Contracts
5
Keen Attention to Cost Management
1.
Product Innovation and Delivery
To maintain our market leadership position, we are accelerating the pace of innovation and new feature delivery to our customers. Our focus has been on two areas, artificial intelligence (AI) and enhancements that continue to improve the connectivity of our suite of solutions. These enhancements are aimed at improving fundraising outcomes while reducing the administrative burden of our end users. Some examples include:
•
We have released a number of AI capabilities in our solutions, including generative AI functionality for our JustGiving platform. During 2024, we released generative AI capabilities for Raiser’s Edge NXT®, and we expect that Blackbaud Copilot will be available to our Raiser's Edge NXT customers soon. Using Blackbaud Copilot, users can ask ad hoc questions such as “How can I improve my average donation size?” and the tool will provide intelligent responses as well as recommended actions intended to drive that outcome.
•
During 2024, our Online Giving and Prospect Insights capabilities were natively integrated into Raiser's Edge NXT. With these integrations, fundraising administrators can now drive a giving campaign, keep records of each donor interaction, identify new donation opportunities, and provide personalized messaging, all in one integrated experience.
•
During 2024, we released our new optimized donation forms for Raiser's Edge NXT, Blackbaud CRM and Blackbaud Altru that fully integrate with our payment processing and CRM software. We expect these forms to drive higher revenue for our customers and for Blackbaud.

We are delivering more innovation, evolving our products and ensuring our customers receive more value from our solutions.
2.
Bookings Growth and Acceleration
We maintain a keen focus on accelerating bookings growth by signing new logos as well as upselling and cross-selling our existing customer base. Our sales team is split between prospect account executives dedicated to prospecting for new clients and customer account executives who focus on selling additional products to current customers. Given the breadth of our product portfolio, this “land and expand” model has proven successful for us over time. As previously disclosed, there can be volatility quarter-to-quarter on bookings.
3.
Transactional Revenue Optimization and Expansion
Transactional revenue, which is about one-third of total revenue, is comprised of four primary components: donation processing (~55% of total transactional revenue); consumer giving (~20%); tuition management (~20%); and event-based usage (~5%). The diversity of the underlying transaction volumes from these four sources has resulted in consistent transactional recurring revenue growth in the mid-to-high single digits over the past several years. We continue to see strong momentum in consumer giving and tuition management, we have implemented rate increases across select areas of our payments portfolio, and we continue to implement additional payments solutions optimization to drive enhanced donor experience.
4.
Modernized Approach to Pricing and Multi-Year Contracts
In the summer of 2022, we put in place an updated pricing policy primarily for our social sector customers that directly reflects the value we provide to them, is in-line with the broader market and reflects the inflationary pressures that all businesses are facing. This program is designed to deliver sustained revenue growth beyond the initial three-year renewal cycle and will provide us with improved revenue visibility. As previously disclosed, this new approach has three main components: offering 3-year contract renewal terms as our standard, which the vast majority of customers are adopting; embedded annual price increases within the 3-year renewal term, which we have not had previously and are beginning to take effect; and a larger first year price increase to bring our pricing in-line with the broader market.  
The first two components, as well as a portion of the third, will continue on beyond the initial renewal cycle, creating what we believe will be a sustainable source of revenue growth.
We have now completed the 2023 and 2024 renewal cohorts, which represented approximately 65% of the total contractual revenue eligible for this program. Approximately another 25% of the renewable base is up for renewal in 2025, and the remaining 10% in the beginning of 2026. The close day-to-day management of renewals, the mix of 3-year and 1-year contracts, and the impact of pricing are progressing well. Additionally, the adoption of 3-year renewals as a standard, with more customers opting for this option than we originally expected, are expected to have an added benefit of higher retention which provides greater revenue assurance and predictability.
5.
Keen Attention to Cost Management
Cost management initiatives already completed drove a significant improvement in profitability during 2023. These initiatives included:
•
A reduction in headcount from approximately 3,600 in the third quarter of 2022 to approximately 3,000 as of December 31, 2023
•
Continued IT consolidation as we migrate customers from legacy private data centers to leading public cloud service providers. We closed four legacy data centers during 2022 and two in 2023.
•
Renegotiated key vendor contracts including Microsoft Azure and AWS
•
Reduced our real estate footprint as part of the shift to a remote-first workforce
During 2024, we continued to run the business at about the same headcount level, while continuing to drive efficiencies in other areas of the business. After the divestiture of EVERFI on December 31, 2024, we had approximately 2,600 employees.

As a remote-first workforce company, we can be strategic about selecting the appropriate geographic region for various functions in order to reduce costs without negatively impacting the quality of our products and services. For example, we are currently expanding our operations in India, which we expect will give us greater access to talent, and increase the number of our employees, including management, in India. We have rented office space in India to accommodate those new operations, although we do not currently expect to generate revenue in India in the foreseeable future.
There are two remaining legacy data centers that we are currently working towards closing in the future.
Financial Summary
Total Revenue ($M)
Income (loss) from Operations ($M)
YoY Growth (%)
YoY Growth (%)

Total revenue increased by $50.1 million during 2024, driven largely by the following:
+
Growth in recurring revenue primarily driven by:
l
an increase in contractual revenue of $36.7 million largely due to the impact of our 3-year contract renewal initiative and pricing within the Social Sector as well as the performance of our cloud solutions, partially offset by decrease in revenue from EVERFI and maintenance revenue; and
l
an increase in transactional recurring revenue of $20.9 million primarily due to positive results related to pricing initiatives we have implemented in the past twelve months and increases in volume for our Blackbaud Tuition Management and JustGiving solutions; also contributing to the increase in transactional recurring revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024 was an increase related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of $2.2 million.
-
Decrease in one-time services and other revenue primarily related to:
l
decrease in one-time consulting revenue of $7.5 million primarily due to a decrease of $7.4 million resulting from our sale of EVERFI Limited as discussed in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in this report
For information on the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results, see Foreign Currency Exchange Rates below on page 
59
.
We have a number of multi-year pricing initiatives underway, some to bring our pricing in line with the market while others are model changes that are expected to drive greater revenue for both us and our customers.
Our Social Sector revenue (which represents approximately 88% of our total full year revenue) increased $67.4 million, or 7.1%, during 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, driven primarily by the increases in contractual recurring revenue and transactional recurring revenue discussed above. The Social Sector has proven to be very resilient as demonstrated through the last several economic downturns and the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have great confidence in the long-term trajectory of this portion of our business.
Our Corporate Sector revenue (which represents approximately 12% of our total full year revenue) decreased $17.3 million, or 11.5%, during 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, driven primarily by the underperformance of EVERFI and our disposition of EVERFI Limited in March 2024 (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for more information).

As previously disclosed, our EVERFI business faced a number of external challenges and even with the decisive actions we took during 2024, including changes to our Corporate Sector leadership and the disposition of a non-recurring revenue component (EVERFI Limited discussed above), EVERFI continued to be a drag on our overall performance, and we expected that to continue. As a result, we took further actions to right-size EVERFI's business to better align costs to its lower revenues, and we hired a strategic advisor to assist us in considering a range of alternatives for EVERFI, one of which included a potential divestiture of the business. This work resulted in the sale of EVERFI in December 2024 in exchange for nominal cash consideration (see page 40 below and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for more information). 
Income from operations decreased by $315.2 million during 2024, driven largely by the following:
-
Pre-tax loss on disposition EVERFI of $405.4 million, including noncash impairment charges of $390.2 million. See "EVERFI disposition charges" below on page 
41
.
+
Increase in total revenue, as described above
-
Increase in third-party contractor costs of $7.6 million largely related to enhancements to our cybersecurity program
-
Increase in compensation costs other than stock-based compensation of $7.6 million primarily due to an increase in resources dedicated to our cybersecurity program
-
Increase in hosting and data center costs of $5.0 million as we continue to migrate our cloud infrastructure to leading public cloud service providers and make investments in security; currently, we expect our cloud infrastructure migration efforts and increased level of cybersecurity investments to continue for the foreseeable future
-
Increase in amortization of intangible assets from business combinations of $4.9 million due to our acquisition of EVERFI
-
Increase in marketing costs of $4.6 million primarily due to increased digital marketing spend related to JustGiving and, to a lesser extent, increased marketing related to EVERFI while we explored strategic options for the business
-
Increase in transaction-based costs of $4.2 million related to the increase in the volume of transactions for which we process payments and, to a lesser extent, increases in vendor rates
-
Increase in amortization of capitalized software and content development costs of $2.5 million due to our continued investments in the innovation and security of our solutions
-
Increase in corporate costs of $2.5 million primarily related to an increase in bad debt expense.  The increase in bad debt expense was driven by an increase in write-offs.
+
Decrease in Security Incident-related expenses of $39.7 million largely related to decreases in loss contingency accruals. See "Security Incident update" below on page 
40
.
+
Decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $22.8 million primarily due overall Company performance against 2024 goals and a decrease in the grant date fair value of equity award grants
+
Decrease in commission expense of $11.7 million primarily due to a prospective increase in the period of benefit over which we amortized costs of obtaining contracts with customers from 5 to 6 years beginning in the year ending December 31, 2024. Also contributing to the decrease in commissions expense was a decrease in commissionable bookings primarily due to EVERFI and fewer sales headcount.
+
Decrease in employee severance of $5.1 million related to our prior period targeted workforce reductions
+
Decrease in acquisition and disposition-related costs of $1.4 million primarily related to less noncash impairment charges against certain operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment assets resulting from the subleases of our Washington, DC office location, partially offset by costs associated with the disposition of EVERFI Limited; see Note 6 and Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for more information.
We are continuing to make investments in the business in areas such as innovation, AI, cybersecurity and our continued shift of cloud infrastructure to leading public cloud service providers. Our profitability during 2024 reflects some of these incremental investments.
We continuously seek opportunities to optimize our portfolio of solutions to focus time and resources on innovation that will have the greatest impact for our customers and the markets we serve, and drive the highest return on investment. To that end, we will continue to simplify and rationalize our portfolio through product sunsets and divestitures of non-core businesses and technologies.

Gross dollar retention

Our recurring subscription contracts are typically for a term of three years at contract inception with standard three year renewals thereafter. A key factor to our overall success is the renewal and expansion of our existing subscription agreements with our customers. Management uses gross dollar retention in analyzing our success at delighting our customers with innovative and cloud solutions. Gross dollar retention is defined as contracted annual recurring revenue ("CARR") divided by beginning CARR with a measurement period of twelve months. During 2024, our gross dollar retention was approximately 90%. This gross dollar retention rate was consistent with our rate for the full year ended December 31, 2023. Excluding EVERFI, our gross dollar retention during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 was approximately 92%. We are continually investing in innovation, which we believe will increase gross dollar retention over the long-term.
Balance sheet and cash flow
At December 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were $67.6 million. Under the 2024 Credit Facilities, the carrying amount of our debt was $1.0 billion and our net leverage ratio was 2.57 to 1.00.
During 2024, we generated $296.0 million in cash flow from operations, had a net increase in borrowings of $296.7 million, returned $418.0 million to stockholders by way of share repurchases and had aggregate cash outlays of $67.2 million for purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software and content development costs.
Release from Washington, DC lease 
In February 2025, we made a one-time cash release payment of $28 million to the lessor in connection with a release from our lease for office space in Washington, DC (which was acquired as part of our acquisition of EVERFI in December 2021). Due to our remote-first workforce strategy, we had not used the office space since February 2023 and had subleased a portion of the space.
Security Incident update
As discussed in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report, total costs related to the Security Incident exceeded the limit of our insurance coverage in the first quarter of 2022. Accordingly, the Security Incident has negatively impacted, and we expect it to continue for the foreseeable future to negatively impact, our GAAP profitability and GAAP cash flow (see discussion regarding non-GAAP free cash flow and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow on page 
53
). For the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred net pre-tax expenses of $13.7 million related to the Security Incident, which included $7.0 million for ongoing legal fees. It also includes settlements and recorded liabilities for loss contingencies of $6.8 million. Also, for the year ended December 31, 2024, we had net cash outlays of $15.9 million related to the Security Incident, which included ongoing legal fees and the $6.8 million paid during the third quarter of 2024 related to our settlement with the Attorney General of the State of California (as discussed in Note 11). In line with our policy, legal fees are expensed as incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2025, we currently expect net pre-tax expense of approximately $2.0 million to $3.0 million and net cash outlays of approximately $3.0 million to $4.0 million for ongoing legal fees related to the Security Incident.
As of December 31, 2024, we have recorded approximately $0.7 million in aggregate liabilities for loss contingencies based primarily on recent negotiations with certain customers related to the Security Incident that we believe we can reasonably estimate in accordance with our loss contingency procedures described in Note 11. It is reasonably possible that our estimated or actual losses may change in the near term for those matters and be materially in excess of the amounts accrued, but we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate the possible additional loss.

Blackbaud, Inc.
There are other Security Incident-related matters for which we have not recorded a liability for a loss contingency as of December 31, 2024 because we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss. Each of these matters could, separately or in the aggregate, result in an adverse judgment, settlement, fine, penalty or other resolution, the amount, scope and timing of which we are currently unable to predict, but could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
EVERFI disposition
On December 9, 2024, the Company concluded that a material impairment charge of up to $415 million was required related to its EVERFI asset group, which primarily included finite-lived intangible assets and capitalized software and content development costs. The total pre-tax noncash charges were subsequently determined to be $390.2 million. On December 31, 2024, we disposed of EVERFI for a nominal amount that resulted in a loss on disposition of $15.2 million, which together with the impairment charges, is recorded within EVERFI disposition on our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for additional details.

Acquisition
On August 19, 2022, we acquired Kilter, Inc. ("Kilter") in order to provide us with strategic opportunities to expand our total addressable market and share of the philanthropic giving market through the integration of complementary solutions and services to serve the changing needs of our customers. 
We have included the results of operations of the acquired company in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. In accordance with applicable accounting rules, we determined that the Kilter acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial statements; therefore, revenue and earnings since the acquisition date and pro forma information are not required or presented. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for a summary of this acquisition.

Recurring revenue includes two components: contractual recurring and transactional recurring. 
Contractual recurring revenue is primarily comprised of fees for the use of our subscription-based software solutions, which includes providing access to cloud solutions, online training programs and subscription-based analytic services. Contractual recurring revenue also includes fees from maintenance services for our on-premises solutions.
Transactional recurring revenue is comprised of transaction fees associated with the use of our solutions, including donation processing, tuition management, consumer giving and event-based usage.
Cost of recurring revenue is primarily comprised of compensation costs for customer support and production IT personnel, hosting and data center costs, third-party contractor expenses, third-party royalty and data expenses, allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs, amortization of intangible assets from business combinations, amortization of software development costs, transaction-based costs related to payments services including remittances of amounts due to third-parties and other costs incurred in providing support and recurring services to our customers.
Our customers continue to prefer cloud subscription offerings with integrated analytics, training and payment services. We intend to continue focusing on innovation, quality and integration of our cloud solutions, which we believe will drive future revenue growth.
2024 vs. 2023
Recurring revenue increased by $57.6 million, or 5.4%, driven primarily by the following:
+
Increase in contractual recurring revenue of $36.7 million largely due to the impact of our 3-year contract renewal initiative and pricing within the Social Sector as well as the performance of our cloud solutions; partially offset by decreases in revenue from EVERFI (as discussed above) and maintenance revenue; and
+
Increase in transactional recurring revenue of $20.9 million primarily due to positive results related to pricing initiatives we have implemented in the past twelve months and increases in volume for our Blackbaud Tuition Management and JustGiving solutions; also contributing to the increase in transactional recurring revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024 was an increase related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates of $2.2 million.

Sales, marketing and customer success expenses decreased by $14.7 million, or 6.9%. The decreases in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue were primarily driven by the following:
-
Decrease in commissions expense of $12.0 million primarily due to a prospective increase in the period of benefit over which we amortized costs of obtaining contracts with customers from 5 to 6 years beginning in the year ending December 31, 2024.

We continue to make investments to delight our customers with innovative cloud solutions. We also continue to invest heavily in the security of our solutions. Research and development expense increased by $7.3 million, or 4.8%. The increases in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue were primarily driven by the following:
+
Increase in compensation costs other than stock-based compensation of $6.6 million primarily related to an increase in resources dedicated to the security-related compliance of our solutions
+
Increase in third-party contractor costs of $3.4 million largely related to enhancements to our cybersecurity program
+
Increase in allocated overhead costs of $2.7 million primarily related to increased headcount discussed above
-
Decrease in stock-based compensation of $4.3 million primarily due overall Company performance against 2024 goals and a decrease in the grant date fair value of equity award grants
-
Decrease in employee severance costs of $1.1 million primarily due to our prior period targeted workforce reductions discussed above
Not included in research and development expense for 2024 and 2023 were $60.8 million and $60.7 million, respectively, of qualifying costs associated with software and content development activities that are required to be capitalized under GAAP, such as those for our cloud solutions, as well as development costs associated with acquired companies. Qualifying capitalized software and content development costs associated with our cloud solutions and online educational courses are subsequently amortized to cost of recurring revenue over the related asset's estimated useful life, which generally range from three to seven years. We expect that the amount of software development costs capitalized will modestly decrease in the near-term due to the disposition of EVERFI. We continue to prioritize making investments in innovation, quality, security and the integration of our solutions, which we believe will drive long-term revenue growth.

Interest income increased primarily due to higher interest earned on restricted cash due to customers for our payment processing solutions. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for more information regarding our other income.

The individual amounts for each year may not sum to total deferred revenue or current portion of deferred revenue due to rounding.
To the extent that our customers are billed for our solutions and services in advance of delivery, we record such amounts in deferred revenue. Our recurring revenue contracts are generally for a term of three years at contract inception with three-year renewals thereafter, billed annually in advance and non-cancelable. We generally invoice our customers with recurring revenue contracts in annual cycles 30 days prior to the end each one-year period.
The decrease in deferred revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to 
our divestiture of EVERFI on December 31, 2024. Historically, due to the timing of customer budget cycles, we have an increase in customer contract renewals at or near the beginning of our third quarter. Generally, our lowest balance of deferred revenue during the year is at the end of our first quarter.
Income Taxes
Income tax (benefit) provision ($M)
Percentages indicate effective income tax rates

Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate quarterly and annually as a result of factors, including changes in tax law in jurisdictions where we conduct business, transactions entered into, changes in the geographic distribution of our earnings or losses, and our assessment of certain tax contingencies and valuation allowances.
We have deferred tax assets for federal, state, and international net operating loss carryforwards, a federal and state capital loss carryforward and tax credits. The federal and state net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards are subject to various Internal Revenue Code limitations and applicable state tax laws. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards have a valuation reserve due to the uncertainty of realizing such carryforwards in the future. Further, as of December 31, 2024, we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our U.S. deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities due to combination of our cumulative pretax loss position and net deferred tax asset position resulting from divestiture of EVERFI. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our U.S. net deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances.
We file income tax returns in the U.S. for federal and various state jurisdictions as well as in foreign jurisdictions including Canada, the U.K., Australia, Ireland and Costa Rica. We are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax examination for calendar tax years ending 2021 through 2024, as well as state and foreign income tax examinations for various years depending on statute of limitations of those jurisdictions.

We have taken federal and state tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease within the next twelve months. The possible decrease could result from the expiration of statutes of limitations. The reasonably possible decrease at December 31, 2024 was insignificant.
We recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
2024 vs. 2023
The decrease in our effective income tax rate for year ended December 31, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily attributable to the valuation allowance recorded in the current period. As of December 31, 2024, we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our U.S. deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities due to the combination of our cumulative pretax loss position and net deferred tax asset position resulting from our divestiture of EVERFI. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our U.S. net deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. Furthermore, the effect of our various rate drivers is reversed by the Company’s 2024 loss position versus income in 2023.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
The operating results analyzed below are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing our operational performance. Accordingly, we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, in evaluating our ongoing operational performance. While we believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful supplemental information, non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation between companies.
The non-GAAP financial measures discussed below exclude the impact of certain transactions because we believe they are not directly related to our operating performance in any particular period, but are for our long-term benefit over multiple periods. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect our ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in our business.

Includes Security Incident-related costs incurred during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 of $13.7 million, which included approximately $6.8 million in recorded liabilities for loss contingencies, and during the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 of $53.4 million, which included approximately $31.0 million in recorded liabilities for loss contingencies. Recorded expenses consisted primarily of payments to third-party service providers and consultants, including legal fees, as well as settlements of customer claims, negotiated settlements and accruals for certain loss contingencies. Not included in this adjustment were costs associated with enhancements to our cybersecurity program. For full year 2025, we currently expect pre-tax expenses of approximately $2 million to $3 million and cash outlays of approximately $3 million to $4 million for ongoing legal fees related to the Security Incident. In line with our policy, legal fees are expensed as incurred. As of December 31, 2024, we have recorded approximately $0.7 million in aggregate liabilities for loss contingencies based primarily on recent negotiations with certain customers related to the Security Incident that we believe we can reasonably estimate. There are other Security Incident-related matters for which we have not recorded a liability for a loss contingency as of December 31, 2024 because we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss. Each of these matters could, separately or in the aggregate, result in an adverse judgment, settlement, fine, penalty or other resolution, the amount, scope and timing of which we are currently unable to predict, but could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
(4)
Beginning in 2024, we now apply a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 24.5% when calculating non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, the tax impact related to non-GAAP adjustments is calculated under our historical non-GAAP effective tax rate of 20.0%.

Non-GAAP organic revenue growth
In addition, we use non-GAAP organic revenue growth, non-GAAP organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP organic recurring revenue growth and non-GAAP organic recurring revenue growth on a constant currency basis in analyzing our operating performance. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors, as a supplement to GAAP measures, for evaluating the periodic growth of our business on a consistent basis. Each of these measures of non-GAAP organic revenue growth excludes incremental acquisition-related revenue attributable to companies, if any, acquired in the current fiscal year. For companies, if any, acquired in the immediately preceding fiscal year, each of these non-GAAP organic revenue growth measures reflects presentation of full year incremental non-GAAP revenue derived from such companies as if they were combined throughout the prior period. In addition, each of these non-GAAP organic revenue growth measures excludes prior period revenue associated with divested businesses. The exclusion of the prior period revenue is to present the results of the divested businesses within the results of the combined company for the same period of time in both the prior and current periods. We believe this presentation provides a more comparable representation of our current business’ organic revenue growth and revenue run-rate.

Rule of 40
We define Rule of 40 as non-GAAP organic revenue growth plus non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is defined as GAAP net income plus interest, net; income tax provision (benefit); depreciation; amortization of intangible assets from business combinations; amortization of software and content development costs; stock-based compensation; employee severance; acquisition and disposition-related costs; Security Incident-related costs; and impairment and disposition charges.

Non-GAAP free cash flow and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow
Non-GAAP free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, including costs required to be capitalized for software and content development, and capital expenditures for property and equipment.
Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, including costs required to be capitalized for software and content development and capital expenditures for property and equipment, plus cash outflows, net of insurance, related to the Security Incident. 
We believe non-GAAP free cash flow and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow provides useful measures of the Company's operating performance. Non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow is not intended to represent and should not be viewed as the amount of residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.

Seasonality
Our revenues normally fluctuate as a result of certain seasonal variations in our business. Our first quarter has historically been the seasonal low for bookings, with the second and fourth quarters historically being seasonally higher, and our bookings tend to be back-end loaded within individual quarters given our quarterly quota plans. Transactional revenue is non-contractual and less predictable given the susceptibility to certain drivers such as timing and number of events and marketing campaigns, as well as fluctuations in donation volumes and tuition payments. Our transactional revenue has historically been at its lowest in the first quarter due to the timing of customer fundraising initiatives and events. We have historically experienced seasonal highs during the fourth quarter due to year-end giving campaigns and during the second quarter when a large number of events are held. Our revenue from professional services has historically been lower in the first quarter when many of those services commence and in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season. As a result of these and other factors, our total revenue has historically been lower in the first quarter than in the remainder of our fiscal year, with the fourth quarter historically achieving the highest total revenue. Our expenses, other than transaction-based costs related to our payments services, do not vary significantly as a result of these factors, but do fluctuate on a quarterly basis due to varying timing of expenditures.
Our cash flow from operations normally fluctuates quarterly due to the combination of the timing of customer contract renewals, delivery of professional services and occurrence of customer events, as well as merit-based salary increases, among other factors. Historically, due to lower revenues in our first quarter, combined with the payment of certain annual vendor contracts, our cash flow from operations has been lowest in our first quarter. Due to the timing of customer contract renewals and student enrollments, many of which take place at or near the beginning of our third quarter, our cash flow from operations has generally been lower in our second quarter as compared to our third and fourth quarters. Partially offsetting these favorable drivers of cash flow from operations in our third and fourth quarters are base salary merit increases, which occur in July. In addition, deferred revenues can vary on a seasonal basis due to the timing of customer contract renewals and student enrollments or significant acquisitions. Our cash flow from financing is negatively impacted in our first quarter when most of our equity awards vest, as we pay taxes on behalf of our employees related to the settlement or exercise of equity awards.

These patterns may change as a result of the continued shift to online giving, growth in volume of transactions for which we process payments, large dollar customer bookings and contract renewals, fluctuations in the timing of vendor payments or as a result of acquisitions, dispositions, such as our sale of EVERFI on December 31, 2024, new market opportunities, new solution introductions or other factors.

Our principal sources of liquidity are our operating cash flow, funds available under the 2024 Credit Facilities and cash on hand. Our operating cash flow depends on continued customer renewal of our subscription and maintenance arrangements, market acceptance of our solutions and services, the volume and size of transactions for which we process payments and our customers' ability to pay. Based on current estimates of revenue and expenses, we believe that the currently available sources of funds and anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate for at least the next twelve months to finance our operations, fund anticipated capital expenditures and meet our debt obligations. We also believe that we will be able to continue to meet our long-term cash requirements due to our anticipated cash flow from operations, solid financial position and ability to access capital from financial markets. To the extent we undertake future material acquisitions, investments or unanticipated capital or operating expenditures, including in connection with the Security Incident, we may require additional capital. In that context, we regularly evaluate opportunities to enhance our capital structure, including through potential debt or equity issuances.
As a well-known seasoned issuer, we filed an automatic shelf registration statement for an undetermined amount of debt and equity securities with the SEC on January 10, 2025. Under this universal shelf registration statement we may offer and sell, from time to time, debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units. Subject to certain conditions, this registration statement will be effective through January 9, 2028.
At December 31, 2024, our total cash and cash equivalents balance included approximately $13.9 million of cash that was held by operations outside the U.S. While these funds may not be needed to fund our U.S. operations for at least the next twelve months, if we need these funds, we may be required to accrue and pay taxes to repatriate the funds. We currently do not intend nor anticipate a need to repatriate our cash held outside the U.S.

Operating Cash Flow
Throughout 2024 and 2023, our cash flows from operations were derived principally from: (i) our earnings from on-going operations prior to non-cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes, amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discount, adjustments to our provision for credit losses and sales returns, the EVERFI impairment charges, loss on disposition of business; and (ii) changes in our working capital. 
Working capital changes are comprised of changes in accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities and deferred revenue.
2024 vs. 2023
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $96.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a $49.4 million increase in net income adjusted for non-cash expenses and a $46.9 million increase in cash flow from operations associated with working capital. 
The increase in cash flow from operations associated with working capital during 2024, when compared to 2023, was primarily due to:
•
fluctuations in the timing of vendor payments;
•
a decrease in accrued expenses related to the Security Incident; partially offset by
•
an increase in cash taxes paid.
In February 2025, we made a one-time cash release payment of $28 million to the lessor in connection with a release from our lease for office space in Washington, DC (which was acquired as part of our acquisition of EVERFI in December 2021). Due to our remote-first workforce strategy, we had not used the office space since February 2023 and had subleased a portion of the space.
Security Incident update
As discussed in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report, total costs related to the Security Incident exceeded the limit of our insurance coverage in the first quarter of 2022. Accordingly, the Security Incident has negatively impacted, and we expect it to continue for the foreseeable future to negatively impact, our GAAP profitability and GAAP cash flow (see discussion regarding non-GAAP free cash flow and non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow on page 
53
). For full year 2024, we had net cash outlays of $15.9 million related to the Security Incident, which included ongoing legal fees and the $6.8 million paid during the third quarter of 2024 related to our settlement with the Attorney General of the State of California. For full year 2025, we currently expect net pre-tax expense of approximately $2.0 million to $3.0 million and net cash outlays of approximately $3.0 million to $4.0 million for ongoing legal fees related to the Security Incident.
As of December 31, 2024, we have recorded approximately $0.7 million in aggregate liabilities for loss contingencies based primarily on recent negotiations with certain customers related to the Security Incident that we believe we can reasonably estimate in accordance with our loss contingency procedures described in Note 11. It is reasonably possible that our estimated or actual losses may change in the near term for those matters and be materially in excess of the amounts accrued, but we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate the possible additional loss. 
There are other Security Incident-related matters for which we have not recorded a liability for a loss contingency as of December 31, 2024 because we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss. Each of these matters could, separately or in the aggregate, result in an adverse judgment, settlement, fine, penalty or other resolution, the amount, scope and timing of which we are currently unable to predict, but could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

Investing Cash Flow
During 2025, we expect our total capital expenditures, including estimated outlays for capitalized software development costs, to be between approximately $55.0 million and $65.0 million.
2024 vs. 2023
Net cash used in investing activities of $73.4 million increased by $9.0 million during 2024, when compared to 2023.
During 2024, we used $59.8 million for software and content development costs, which was up $0.3 million from cash spent during 2023. We also spent $7.4 million of cash for purchases of property and equipment during 2024, which was an increase of $2.8 million from cash spent in 2023. In addition, we used net cash of $1.2 million in the disposition of a business and $5.0 million for a minority investment in a business during 2024.
Financing Cash Flow
2024 vs. 2023
During 2024, we had a net increase in borrowings of $296.7 million, primarily due to our stock repurchase program, including our ASR Transaction (as defined on page 
105
) in March 2024. During 2024, we repurchased $418.0 million of our common stock compared to $18.8 million during 2023 (see additional details below regarding
 our stock repurchase program). 
We also paid $6.5 million in debt issuance costs in conjunction with our April 2024 refinancing.
We paid $56.8 million to satisfy tax obligations of employees upon settlement or exercise of equity awards during 2024 compared to $35.9 million during 2023. The amount of taxes paid by us on behalf of employees related to the settlement or exercise of equity awards varies from period to period based upon the timing of grants and vesting, as well as the market price for shares of our common stock at the time of settlement. Most of our equity awards currently vest in our first quarter.

Stock repurchase program
On January 17, 2024, our Board of Directors reauthorized, expanded and replenished our stock repurchase program by raising the total capacity under the program from $250.0 million to $500.0 million available for repurchases. The program does not have an expiration date. Under the stock repurchase program, we are authorized to repurchase shares from time to time in accordance with applicable laws both on the open market, including under trading plans established pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of repurchases depends on several factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of our common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities. The repurchase program may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
In March 2024, we announced that we intended to repurchase during 2024 between 7% and 10% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2023 under our repurchase program. Consistent with that commitment, in March 2024, we entered into the ASR Transaction to repurchase an aggregate $200 million of shares of our common stock. Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Transaction, we provided the financial institution with a prepayment of $200 million and received an initial delivery of 2.1 million shares of our common stock, representing approximately 70% of the total shares then-expected to be repurchased under the ASR Transaction. The final number of shares of common stock delivered to us under the ASR Transaction was based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the common stock during the term of the ASR Transaction, less a discount and subject to customary adjustments upon events affecting the common stock (e.g., dilutive or concentrative events, mergers and acquisitions, and market disruptions). We funded the ASR Transaction prepayment with borrowings pursuant to a revolving credit loan under the then effective 2020 Credit Agreement. 
On October 29, 2024, in connection with the settlement of the ASR Transaction, we received approximately 490,000 shares of our common stock, in addition to the 2.1 million shares received in March 2024. No cash was exchanged as part of the settlement of the ASR Transaction.

On July 16, 2024, our Board of Directors reauthorized, expanded and replenished our stock repurchase program by expanding the total capacity under the program from $500.0 million to $800.0 million available for repurchases.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased an aggregate of 5,362,439 shares for $418.0 million, including the shares repurchased pursuant to the ASR Transaction and representing approximately 10.0% of the Company's common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2023. When including the net share settlement on employee stock-based compensation, this figure increases to approximately 11%. The remaining amount available to purchase stock under the approved stock repurchase program was $644.6 million as of December 31, 2024. During 2025, we intend to repurchase between 3% and 5% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2024 under our existing stock repurchase program.
2024 Credit Facilities
Historically, we have drawn on our credit facility from time to time to help us meet financial needs primarily due to the seasonality of our cash flows from operations and financing for business acquisitions. At December 31, 2024, our available borrowing capacity under the 2024 Credit Facilities was $468.7 million. The 2024 Credit Facilities mature in April 2029.
At December 31, 2024, the carrying amount of our debt under the 2024 Credit Facilities was $1.0 billion. Our average daily borrowings were $929.5 million during 2024.
The term loans under the 2024 Credit Facilities and our other debt require periodic principal payments. The balance of the term loans and any amounts drawn on the revolving credit loans are due upon maturity of the 2024 Credit Facilities in April 2029. Certain real estate loans (as described in Note 9 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report) also require periodic principal payments and the balances of the real estate loans are due upon maturity in April 2038.
The following is a summary of the financial covenants under the 2024 Credit Facilities:

Under the terms of the 2024 Credit Facilities, the Net Leverage Ratio requirement may be increased by up to 0.50 provided we satisfy certain requirements, including a permitted business acquisition, and provided that the maximum Net Leverage Ratio shall not exceed 4.25 to 1.00. 
Under the 2024 Credit Facilities, we also have restrictions on our ability to declare and pay dividends and our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock. In order to pay any cash dividends and/or repurchase shares of stock: (i) no default or event of default shall have occurred and be continuing under the 2024 Credit Facilities, and (ii) our pro forma net leverage ratio, as set forth in the 2024 Credit Facilities, must be 0.25 less than the net leverage ratio requirement at the time of dividend declaration or stock repurchase. At December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with our debt covenants under the 2024 Credit Facilities. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding the 2024 Credit Facilities.

Debt
As of December 31, 2024, we had total remaining principal payments of $1.1 billion. These payments represent principal payments only, under the following assumptions: (i) that the amounts outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facilities, our real estate loans and our other debt at December 31, 2024 will remain outstanding until maturity, with minimum payments occurring as currently scheduled, and (ii) that there are no assumed future borrowings on the 2024 Revolving Facility for the purposes of determining minimum commitment amounts. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for more information.
Interest payments on debt
In addition to principal payments, as of December 31, 2024, we expect to pay interest expense over the life of our debt obligations of approximately $273.4 million. These payments represent our estimated future interest payments on debt using our debt balances and the related weighted average effective interest rates as of December 31, 2024, which includes the effect of interest rate swap agreements. The actual interest expense recognized in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss will depend on the amount of debt, the length of time the debt is outstanding and the interest rate, which could be different from our assumptions on our remaining principal payments described above.
Operating leases
As of December 31, 2024, we had remaining operating lease payments of $45.4 million. These payments have not been reduced by sublease income, incentive payments, reimbursement of leasehold improvements or the amount representing imputed interest of $6.7 million. Our operating leases are generally for corporate offices, subleased offices and certain equipment and furniture. Given our remote-first workforce strategy and real estate footprint optimization efforts, as discussed above, we do not anticipate entering any new, material operating leases for offices for the foreseeable future. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for more information.
In February 2025, we made a one-time cash release payment of $28 million to the lessor in connection with a release from our lease for office space in Washington, DC (which was acquired as part of our acquisition of EVERFI in December 2021). Due to our remote-first workforce strategy, we had not used the office space since February 2023 and had subleased a portion of the space.
Purchase obligations
As of December 31, 2024, we had remaining purchase obligations of $184.4 million. These purchase obligations are for third-party technology used in our solutions and for other services we purchase as part of our normal operations. In certain cases, these arrangements require a minimum annual purchase commitment by us. Our purchase obligations are not recorded as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024, as we had not received the related services. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for more information.
The total liability for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024 was $5.2 million. Our accrued interest and penalties related to tax positions taken on our tax returns was $0.9 million as of December 31, 2024.
In connection with the settlement of the multi-state Attorneys General investigation, the California Attorney General investigation and the FTC investigation relating to the Security Incident, as discussed in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements in this report, we have agreed to implement and improve certain of our cybersecurity programs and tools through May 2044. The currently anticipated costs in connection with these efforts are expected to be expensed as incurred.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates
Approximately 14% of our total revenue for 2024 was generated from operations outside the U.S. We do not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary. Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and, accordingly, changes in the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar will affect the translation of our subsidiaries’ financial results into U.S. dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results. The accumulated currency translation adjustment, recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders’ equity, was a loss of $12.7 million as of December 31, 2024 and a loss of $9.8 million as of December 31, 2023. We have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure that arises on translation of our investments denominated in British Pounds into U.S. dollars.
The vast majority of our contracts are entered into by our U.S. or U.K. entities. The contracts entered into by the U.S. entity are almost always denominated in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars, and contracts entered into by our U.K., Australian and Irish subsidiaries are generally denominated in British Pounds, Australian dollars and Euros, respectively. Historically, as the U.S. dollar weakened, foreign currency translation resulted in an increase in our revenues and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies. Conversely, as the U.S. dollar strengthened, foreign currency translation resulted in a decrease in our revenues and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies. During 2024, foreign translation resulted in increases in our revenues and expenses denominated in non-U.S. currencies. Though we have exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily those between the U.S. dollar and both the British Pound and Canadian dollar, the impact has generally not been material to our consolidated results of operations or financial position. During 2024, the fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates increased our total revenue and our income from operations by $3.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively. We have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge revenues denominated in the Canadian dollar against changes in the exchange rate with the U.S. dollar. We will continue monitoring such exposure and take action as appropriate. To determine the impacts on revenue (or income from operations) from fluctuations in currency exchange rates, current period revenues (or income from operations) from entities reporting in foreign currencies were translated into U.S. dollars using the comparable prior year period's weighted average foreign currency exchange rates. These impacts are non-GAAP financial information and are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, information prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions.
We base our estimates on historical experience, current trends and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could materially differ from any of our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in this report. We believe the accounting estimates listed below are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.

Revenue Recognition
Description
Judgments and Uncertainties
Effect if Actual Results Differ
 From Assumptions
See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policies.
Revenues are recognized when control of our services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.
We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:
(1) Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
(2) Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
(3) Determination of the transaction price;
(4) Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
(5) Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to recognize revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Our revenue recognition accounting methodology may contain uncertainties because it could require us to make significant estimates and assumptions, and to apply judgment for certain customer contracts.
For example, for certain arrangements that have multiple performance obligations, we may need to exercise judgment and use estimates in order to (1) determine whether performance obligations are distinct and should be accounted for separately; (2) determine the standalone selling price of each performance obligation; (3) allocate the transaction price among the various performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis; and (4) determine whether revenue for each performance obligation should be recognized at a point in time or over time.
If we were to change any of these judgments or estimates, it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue or deferred revenue that we report in a particular period.

Business Combinations
Description
Judgments and Uncertainties
Effect if Actual Results Differ
 From Assumptions
We allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to its identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based upon their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, if any, is recorded as goodwill.
We use available information to estimate fair values. We typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of long-lived and identifiable intangible assets, and any other significant assets or liabilities. We adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, as necessary, up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the closing date.
We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use for business combinations during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, especially with respect to long-lived and intangible assets.
Management estimates the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows, market multiple analyses and replacement cost.
We apply significant judgement in estimating the fair value of intangible assets acquired, which involves the use of significant assumptions. Significant assumptions used in the valuation of customer relationships include future revenue and operating expenses, customer attrition rates, contributory asset charges, tax amortization benefit, and discount rates. Significant assumptions used in the valuation of certain developed technology assets include future revenue, proprietary technology obsolescence curve, royalty rate, and discount rate. Significant assumptions used in the valuation of marketing assets include assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be valuable, royalty rate, and discount rate. Significant assumptions used in the valuation of content intangible assets include cost-based assumptions. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and unanticipated events and changes in circumstances may occur.
If actual results are materially different than the assumptions we used to determine fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed through a business combination as well as the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangible assets, it is possible that adjustments to the carrying values of such assets and liabilities will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.
See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in this report for information regarding our business acquisitions.

Income Taxes
Description
Judgments and Uncertainties
Effect if Actual Results Differ
 From Assumptions
We make estimates and judgments in accounting for income taxes. Our income tax returns, like those of most companies, are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities.
We measure and recognize uncertain tax positions. To recognize uncertain tax positions, we must first determine if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit. We must then measure the benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
We make estimates in determining tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess income tax during the year ended December 31, 2024.
The calculation of our income tax provision requires estimates due to transactions, credits and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Uncertainties arise as a consequence of the actual source of taxable income between domestic and foreign locations, the outcome of tax audits and the ultimate utilization of tax credits.
Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in the geographic distribution of our earnings or losses, changes in tax law in jurisdictions where we conduct business.
Significant judgment is required in the identification and measurement of uncertain tax positions. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions.
In assessing the adequacy of a recorded valuation allowance significant judgment is required. We consider all positive and negative evidence and a variety of factors including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, historical and projected future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.
Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.
To the extent actual results differ from estimated amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which the determination is made.
If we determine there is less than a 50% likelihood that we will be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value, then an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is made to increase income tax expense, thereby reducing net income in the period such determination was made.
Long-lived Assets and Intangible Assets Other Than Goodwill
Description
Judgments and Uncertainties
Effect if Actual Results Differ
 From Assumptions
We review our long-lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If such events or changes in circumstances occur, we use the undiscounted cash flow method to determine whether our long-lived and intangible assets other than goodwill are impaired. To the extent that the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining life of the asset, we measure the impairment using discounted cash flows.
We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the year ended December 31, 2024.
In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows from other asset groups.
When measuring impairment of an asset or asset group using discounted cash flows, we make assumptions and apply judgment in estimating future cash flows and asset or asset group fair values, including annual revenue growth rates, a terminal year growth rate and selecting a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows.
During 2024, we recorded material noncash impairment charges against our EVERFI asset group, which primarily included finite-lived intangible assets and capitalized software and content development costs. For additional information, see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in this report.
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to assess impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could materially adversely impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Loss Contingencies
Description
Judgments and Uncertainties
Effect if Actual Results Differ
 From Assumptions
We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies, including legal proceedings and claims, that arise in the normal course of business, as well as certain other non-ordinary course proceedings, claims and investigations, as described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in this report. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a material liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the low end of the range. For proceedings in which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable and an estimate of the loss or range of losses arising from the proceeding can be made, we disclose such an estimate, if material. If such a loss or range of losses is not reasonably estimable, we disclose that fact. 
We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess loss contingencies during the year ended December 31, 2024.
We review any such loss contingency accruals at least quarterly and adjust them to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. 
Often these issues are subject to substantial uncertainties and, therefore, the probability of loss and the estimation of damages are difficult to ascertain. These assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by us. 
With the exception of the 2020 Security Incident, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine loss contingencies. However, if facts and circumstances change in the future that change our belief regarding assumptions used to determine our estimates, we may be exposed to losses that could be material.
Although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters, we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any particular period. For additional information, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements in this report.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We have market rate sensitivity for interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.
Interest Rate Risk
Our variable rate debt is our primary financial instrument with market risk exposure for changing interest rates. We manage our variable rate interest rate risk through a combination of short-term and long-term borrowings and the use of derivative instruments entered into for hedging purposes. Additionally, our interest income that we primarily earn on restricted cash due to customers for our payment processing solutions acts as a partial natural hedge against our interest rate risk. Our interest rate exposure includes SOFR rates. Due to the nature of our debt, the materiality of the fair values of the derivative instruments and the highly liquid, short-term nature and level of our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024, we believe that the risk of exposure to changing interest rates for those positions is immaterial. There were no significant changes in how we manage interest rate risk between December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2024.
Foreign Currency Risk
For a discussion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Foreign Currency Exchange Rates” in Item 7 of this report.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Blackbaud, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Blackbaud, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, cash flows and stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition - Payment Processing Services
Description of
the Matter 
The Company recorded transactional recurring revenues of $354 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Included in transactional recurring revenues are revenues related to payment processing services. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue for payment processing services over time based on the amount billable to the customer, since it has the right to invoice the customer in an amount that directly corresponds with the value to the customer for the Company’s performance to date. The processing of transactions and recording of revenues for these services involves a significant volume of transactions that are highly automated and are based on contractual terms with the customer and the Company’s third-party vendors.
Auditing the revenues for these payment processing services is complex because the processes are highly automated and involve multiple IT systems with a significant volume of transactions and related underlying data. Further, auditing the revenues for these payment processing services required the involvement of data professionals to assist in validating the integrity of the underlying data and recalculating the revenues recorded during the period.

How We Addressed the 
Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls over its payment processing services. We identified the relevant systems used in these payment processing services, including relevant third-party service organization systems, and evaluated the IT general controls over each of these systems. We also tested the relevant automated controls and other business processes controls.
To test revenue recognized for payment processing services, our procedures included, among others, the involvement of data professionals to recalculate the revenue recognized. For a selection of payment processing transactions, we also agreed the amount of revenues recognized for processing fees retained by the Company to source documents and tested the mathematical accuracy of the recorded revenue. We also evaluated if the transactions were processed, and funds received, including sending confirmations directly to financial institutions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Blackbaud, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Blackbaud, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Blackbaud, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive loss, cash flows, and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those that impact revenue recognition, long-lived and intangible assets, income taxes, business combinations, stock-based compensation, capitalization of software development costs, our allowances for credit losses and sales returns, costs of obtaining contracts, valuation of derivative instruments, loss contingencies and insurance recoveries, among others. Changes in the facts or circumstances underlying these estimates could result in material changes and actual results could materially differ from these estimates.
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
 ("ASU 2023-07"). This update requires disclosures to include significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), a description of other segment items by reportable segment, and any additional measures of a segment's profit or loss used by the CODM when deciding how to allocate resources. We adopted ASU 2023-07 on December 31, 2024 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements
There are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations when adopted in the future.
Summary of significant accounting policies
Revenue recognition
Our revenue is primarily generated from the following sources: (i) charging for the use of our software solutions in cloud and hosted environments; and (ii) providing payment and transaction services. Revenue is recognized when control of these services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those services.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:
•
Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
•
Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
•
Determination of the transaction price;
•
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
•
Recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.
Our recurring revenue includes two components: contractual recurring and transactional recurring.
Contractual recurring
Contractual recurring revenue is primarily comprised of fees for the use of our subscription-based software solutions, which includes providing access to cloud solutions, online training programs and subscription-based analytic services. Contractual recurring revenue also includes fees from maintenance services for our on-premises solutions.
Contractual recurring revenue represents stand-ready performance obligations in which we are making our solutions or services available to our customers continuously over time or the value of the contract renews. Therefore, contractual recurring revenue is generally recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term, beginning on the date that the solution or service is made available to the customer. Our contractual recurring revenue contracts are generally for a term of 
three years
 at contract inception with 
three
-year renewals thereafter, billed annually in advance and non-cancelable.
Transactional recurring
Transactional recurring revenue is comprised of transaction fees associated with the use of our solutions, including donation processing, tuition management, consumer giving and event-based usage.
Our payment services are offered with the assistance of third-party vendors. In general, when we are the principal in a transaction based on the factors identified in ASC 606-10-55-36 through 55-40, we record the revenue and related costs on a gross basis. Otherwise, we net the cost of revenue associated with the service against the gross revenue (amount withheld for the transaction fees) and record the net amount as revenue. For payment and transaction services, we have the right to invoice the customer in an amount that directly corresponds with the value to the customer of our performance to date. Therefore, we recognize revenue for these services over time based on the amount we withhold for the transaction fees in accordance with the 'as invoiced' practical expedient in ASC 606-10-55-18.
One-time services and other
One-time services and other revenue is primarily comprised of fees for one-time consulting, analytic and onsite training services and fees for retained and managed services contracts that we do not expect to have a term consistent with our cloud solution contracts.
We generally bill consulting services based on hourly rates plus reimbursable travel-related expenses. Fixed price consulting engagements are generally billed as milestones towards completion are reached. Revenue for one-time consulting services is generally recognized over time as the services are performed.
Fees for retained and managed services contracts are generally billed in advance and recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract term, beginning on the date the service is made available to the customer.
Contracts with multiple performance obligations
Some of our contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices of our solutions and services are typically estimated based on observable transactions when the solutions or services are sold on a standalone basis.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Costs of obtaining contracts, contract assets and deferred revenue
We pay sales commissions at the time contracts with customers are signed or shortly thereafter, depending on the size and duration of the sales contract. Sales commissions and related fringe benefits earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. These costs are deferred and then amortized in a manner that aligns with the expected period of benefit, which we have determined to be 
six years
. We determined the period of benefit by taking into consideration our customer contracts, including renewals, retention, our technology and other factors. We generally do not pay commissions for contract renewals that are commensurate with the commission paid on the initial contract. The related amortization expense is included in sales, marketing and customer success expense in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.
A contract asset is recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of our right to receive consideration (i.e., we must satisfy additional performance obligations in order to receive consideration). Amounts are recorded as receivables when our right to consideration is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due). Our contract assets are recorded within prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. To the extent that our customers are billed for our solutions and services in advance of us satisfying the related performance obligations, we record such amounts in deferred revenue.
Sales taxes
We present sales taxes and other taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis and, as such, exclude them from revenues.
Fair value measurements
We measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivative instruments. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. An active market is defined as a market in which transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. We use a three-tier fair value hierarchy to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows:
•
Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;
•
Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and
•
Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
Our financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety within the hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to fair value measurement. Changes to a financial asset's or liability's level within the fair value hierarchy are determined as of the end of a reporting period. All methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.
Derivative instruments
We generally use derivative instruments to manage interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk. We view derivative instruments as risk management tools and do not use them for trading or speculative purposes. Our policy requires that derivatives used for hedging purposes be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract.
We record all derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value as either an asset or liability. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of the changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive loss and reclassified to earnings in a manner that matches the timing of the earnings impact of the hedged transactions. If the derivative is designated as a net investment hedge, the effective portions of the changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded to translation adjustment, a component of other comprehensive loss, and recognized in earnings only when the hedged investment is liquidated. Ineffective portions of the changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized currently in earnings.
 See Note 10 to these consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our derivative instruments.

Cash and cash equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less and cash items in transit to be cash equivalents.
Restricted cash due to customers; Customer funds receivable; Due to customers
Restricted cash due to customers consists of monies collected and held at banks, payment processors, or other financial institutions (or in transit) and payable to our customers, net of the associated transaction fees earned. Monies associated with amounts due to customers are segregated in separate bank accounts and used exclusively for the payment of amounts due to customers. This usage restriction is either legally or internally imposed and reflects our intention with regard to such deposits. Customer funds receivable consists of monies we expect to collect and remit to our customers.
Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash due to customers and accounts receivable. Our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash due to customers are placed with high credit-quality financial institutions. Our accounts receivable is derived from sales to customers. With respect to accounts receivable, we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for credit losses based on historical experience and our expectations of future credit losses.
 As of and for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were no significant concentrations with respect to our consolidated revenues or accounts receivable.
Property and equipment
We record property and equipment assets at cost and depreciate them over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the term of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to earnings. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Construction-in-progress primarily related to purchases of information technology assets which had not been placed in service at the respective balance sheet dates. We transfer these assets to the applicable property and equipment category on the date they are placed in service.
 There was 
no
 capitalized interest applicable to construction-in-progress for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Business combinations
We include the operating results of acquired companies as well as the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. We are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based upon their estimated fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date represents the excess of the purchase consideration of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
We apply significant judgement in estimating the fair value of intangible assets acquired, which involves the use of significant assumptions. Significant assumptions used in the valuation of customer relationships include future revenue and operating expenses, customer attrition rates, contributory asset charges, tax amortization benefit, and discount rates. Significant assumptions used in the valuation of certain developed technology assets include future revenue, proprietary technology obsolescence curve, royalty rate, and discount rate. Significant assumptions used in the valuation of marketing assets include assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be valuable, royalty rate, and discount rate. Significant assumptions used in the valuation of content intangible assets include cost-based assumptions. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and unanticipated events and changes in circumstances may occur.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the purchase price in excess of the net amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed by us in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but tested annually for impairment on the first day of our fourth quarter, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment arise.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Accounting guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. Significant judgment is required in the assessment of qualitative factors, including but not limited to an evaluation of macroeconomic conditions as they relate to our business, industry and market trends, as well as the overall future financial performance of identified reporting units and future opportunities in the markets in which we operate.
The quantitative impairment test compares the fair values of identified reporting units with their respective carrying amounts. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.
 Based on our current internal reporting structure, we have 
one
 operating segment, 
one
 reportable segment, and 
one
 reporting unit. In each of 2024, 2023 and 2022, we performed the quantitative impairment test, which indicated that the estimated fair values of the identified reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values. There were 
no
 impairments of goodwill during 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Intangible assets other than goodwill
We amortize finite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives as follows.

Certain of the customer relationships, marketing assets and developed technology assets are amortized on a curve that represents the expected period of economic benefit.
We write off the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization balances for all fully amortized intangible assets. We evaluate the estimated useful lives and the potential for impairment of finite and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate revised estimates of useful lives may be appropriate or that the carrying amount may be impaired. If the carrying amount of a finite-lived intangible asset is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted cash flows of the asset, the amount of impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.
 All of our intangible assets were acquired in business combinations. See Note 6 to these consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our impairment of certain intangible assets during 2024 and 2022. There were 
no
 impairments of acquired intangible assets during 2023.
Impairment of long-lived assets
We review long-lived assets for impairment when events change or circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market value of the business or asset acquired, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the business or asset acquired is used or significant adverse change in the business climate. If such events or changes in circumstances are present, the undiscounted cash flow method is used to determine whether the asset or asset group is impaired.
 See Note 6 to these consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our impairment of certain long-lived assets during 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Deferred financing costs and debt discount
Deferred financing costs included in other assets represent the direct third-party costs of entering into the revolving (line-of-credit) portion of our credit facility in April 2024 and portions of the unamortized deferred financing costs from prior facilities. These costs are amortized ratably over the term of the credit facility as interest expense.

Table of Contents
Blackbaud, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Other debt issuance costs, as well as the debt discount associated with the 2024 Credit Facilities (as defined below) and portions of the unamortized balances from prior facilities, are recorded as a direct deduction from debt. These costs are amortized over the term of the credit facility as interest expense.
Stock-based compensation
We measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period.
We recognize the effect of awards for which the requisite service period is not rendered when the award is forfeited (that is, we recognize the effect of forfeitures in compensation cost when they occur). Previously recognized compensation cost for an award is reversed in the period that the award is forfeited. Income tax benefits resulting from the vesting and exercise of stock-based compensation awards are recognized in the period the unit or award is vested or option or right is exercised.
Income taxes
We make estimates and judgments in accounting for income taxes. The calculation of the income tax provision requires estimates due to transactions, credits and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Uncertainties arise as a consequence of the actual source of taxable income between domestic and foreign locations, the outcome of tax audits and the ultimate utilization of tax credits. To the extent actual results differ from estimated amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which the determination is made.
We make estimates in determining tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. In assessing the adequacy of a recorded valuation allowance significant judgment is required. We consider all positive and negative evidence and a variety of factors including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, historical and projected future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. If we determine there is less than a 50% likelihood that we will be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value, then an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is made to increase income tax expense, thereby reducing net income in the period such determination was made.
We measure and recognize uncertain tax positions. To recognize such positions, we must first determine if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit. We must then measure the benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Significant judgment is required in the identification and measurement of uncertain tax positions.
Foreign currency
Net assets recorded in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expense items are translated using an average of monthly exchange rates. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.
Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions denominated in currency other than the functional currency are recorded at the approximate rate of exchange at the transaction date in other income, net.
 For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022, we recorded net foreign currency gains that were insignificant and $
4.6
 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded a net foreign currency loss  that was insignificant.
Research and development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred except as noted below under 
Software and content development costs
. These costs include compensation costs for engineering and product management personnel, third-party contractor expenses, software development tools and other expenses related to researching and developing new solutions or upgrading and enhancing existing solutions that do not qualify for capitalization, and allocated depreciation, facilities and IT support costs.
Software and content development costs
We incur certain costs associated with the development of internal-use software and content, which are primarily related to activities performed to develop our cloud solutions and the development of online education curriculum to be delivered on 
78
2024 Form 10-K
Table of Contents
Blackbaud, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
the Company's cloud platform. Internal and external costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of internal-use software development and content are expensed as incurred. Once the software or content being developed has reached the application development stage, qualifying internal costs including payroll and payroll-related costs of employees who are directly associated with and devote time to the software or content project as well as external direct costs of materials and services are capitalized. Capitalization ceases at the point at which the developed software or content is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, which is typically upon completion of all substantial testing. Qualifying costs capitalized during the application development stage include those related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable that those costs incurred will result in additional functionality. Overhead costs, including general and administrative costs, as well as maintenance, training and all other costs associated with post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred. In addition, internal costs that cannot be reasonably separated between maintenance and relatively minor upgrades and enhancements are expensed as incurred. In certain circumstances, content development costs are considered deferred costs, when ownership of developed content belongs to the customer.
Qualifying capitalized software and content development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software asset's estimated useful life, which is generally 
three
 to 
seven years
. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.
 See Note 6 to these consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our impairment of certain capitalized software and content development costs during 2024 and 2022. There were 
no
 impairments of capitalized software assets during 2023. We write off the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization balances for all fully amortized capitalized software and content development cost assets.
Allowance for credit losses
Our accounts receivable consist of a single portfolio segment. Accounts receivable are recorded at original invoice amounts less an allowance for credit losses, an amount we estimate to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against lifetime expected losses resulting from extending credit to our customers. In judging the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, we consider multiple factors including historical bad debt experience, the current aging of our receivables and current economic conditions that may affect our customers' ability to pay. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing these factors and if any receivables were to deteriorate, an additional provision for credit losses could be required. Accounts are written off after all means of collection are exhausted and recovery is considered remote. Provisions for credit losses are recorded in general and administrative expense.

, which were $
16.0
 million, $
14.0
 million and $
16.5
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Restructuring costs
Restructuring costs include charges for the costs of exit or disposal activities. The liability for costs associated with exit or disposal activities is measured initially at fair value and only recognized when the liability is incurred.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets, accrued expense and other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities, net of current portion in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate is based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at the commencement date. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any initial direct costs and lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments related to our operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. We do not recognize short-term leases (those that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less) on our consolidated balance sheets. Variable lease payments, which are primarily comprised of common-area maintenance, utilities and real estate taxes that are passed on from the lessor in proportion to the space leased by us, are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.
Loss contingencies
We are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies, including legal proceedings and claims, that arise in the normal course of business, as well as certain other non-ordinary course proceedings, claims and investigations, as described in Note 11 to these consolidated financial statements. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Often these issues are subject to substantial uncertainties and, therefore, the probability of loss and the estimation of damages are difficult to ascertain. These assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by us. Although we believe we have substantial defenses in these matters, we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any particular period.
(Loss) earnings per share
We compute basic (loss) earnings per share by dividing net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the assumed exercise, settlement and vesting of all dilutive securities using the “treasury stock method” except when the effect is anti-dilutive. Potentially dilutive securities consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and stock appreciation rights and vesting of restricted stock awards and units. In periods where there are net losses and the inclusion of potentially dilutive securities would be anti-dilutive, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share.

3. Business Combinations and Dispositions
2024 dispositions
EVERFI, LLC
On December 31, 2024, we disposed of our EVERFI business, formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of Blackbaud, Inc, to a private investment firm that is unaffiliated with Blackbaud for nominal cash consideration. We incurred $
14.0
 million of costs associated with the disposition of this business, all of which were recorded as accrued expenses and other liabilities as of December 31, 2024. As a result of the disposition, we recorded a loss of $
15.2
 million, which included direct costs to sell the business. This loss on disposition together with EVERFI impairment charges are recorded within EVERFI disposition on our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2024.  See Note 4 to these consolidated financial statements for additional information about the EVERFI impairment charges. 
EVERFI Limited
On March 2, 2024, we completed a transaction to divest our U.K.-based creative services business EVERFI Limited, formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of EVERFI, Inc, which was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Blackbaud, Inc. EVERFI Limited's total revenue during 2023 was $
8.4
 million. We incurred an insignificant amount of legal costs associated with the disposition of this business. As a result of the disposition, we recorded a $
1.6
 million loss, which was recorded in general and administrative expense on our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2024.
2022 disposition
Blackbaud FIMS™ and DonorCentral® NXT
On September 9, 2022, we sold our Foundation Information Management System ("FIMS") and DonorCentral NXT solutions to Fusion Laboratories, LLC for cash proceeds of approximately $
6.4
 million, net of closing adjustments. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a noncash impairment charge of $
2.0
 million against certain insignificant FIMS customer relationship intangible assets that were then held for sale. The impairment charge was recorded in general and administrative expense on our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.
2022 acquisition
Kilter
On August 19, 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Kilter, Inc., a Delaware corporation, pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, for approximately $
2.9
 million in cash, net of closing adjustments. In addition to the consideration paid at closing, the agreement and plan of merger included cash consideration payable, up to a maximum of $
3.0
 million, if during the two-year period commencing January 1, 2023 Kilter met certain application participation targets. These targets were not met and, therefore, no liability is recorded as of December 31, 2024. Fair values were also assigned to the other assets acquired and liabilities assumed, primarily consisting of goodwill and a finite-lived developed technology intangible asset, which will be amortized over an estimated useful life of three years. We finalized the purchase price allocation of Kilter, including the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, during the third quarter of 2023. Insignificant acquisition-related costs, which primarily consisted of legal services, were recorded as general and administrative expense during the year ended December 31, 2023.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, changes to the gross carrying amounts of intangible asset classes were primarily related to the EVERFI impairment charges and subsequent disposition discussed below, write-offs of fully amortized intangible assets and the effect of foreign currency translation.
EVERFI impairment charges
In July 2024, we hired a strategic advisor to assist us in considering a range of alternatives for EVERFI, one of which included a potential divestiture of the business. As part of evaluating alternatives for EVERFI, during the fourth quarter of 2024, we prepared a revised business forecast that included a new level of detail, including separately identifiable cash flows for EVERFI. The Company then reassessed its asset groupings under ASC 360-10 and determined there was a new asset group for EVERFI and evaluated this asset group for potential impairment. On December 9, 2024, the Company concluded that a material impairment charge was required related to its EVERFI asset group, which primarily included finite-lived intangible assets and capitalized software and content development costs. On December 29, 2024, we classified EVERFI's assets and liabilities as held for sale and we determined there would be an additional impairment charge to record the EVERFI disposal group at its estimated fair value less costs to sell resulting in total noncash impairment charges of $
390.2
 million. On December 31, 2024, we disposed of EVERFI for a nominal amount that resulted in a loss on disposition of $
15.2
 million, which together with the impairment charges, is recorded within EVERFI disposition on our consolidated statements of

comprehensive loss. See Note 3 to these consolidated financial statements for additional information about the disposition of EVERFI.
Amortization expense
Amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets acquired in business combinations is allocated to cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income based on the revenue stream to which the asset contributes, except for marketing assets and non-compete agreements, for which the associated amortization expense is included in operating expenses.

Our derivative instruments within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, are required to be recorded at fair value. Our derivative instruments that are recorded at fair value include interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts. See Note 10 to these consolidated financial statements for additional information about our derivative instruments.
The fair value of our interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts are based on model-driven valuations using Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") rates and foreign currency forward rates, respectively, which are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Accordingly, our interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Contingent consideration obligations arise from business acquisitions. The fair values are based on discounted cash flow analyses reflecting a probability-weighted assessment approach derived from the likelihood of possible achievement of specified performance measures or events and captures the contractual nature of the contingencies, commercial risk, and the time value of money. As the fair value measurements for our contingent consideration obligations contain significant unobservable inputs, they are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 3 to these consolidated financial statements for additional information about our contingent consideration obligations.
We believe the carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and due to customers approximate their fair values at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these instruments.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
We believe the carrying amount of our debt approximates its fair value at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, as the debt bears interest rates that approximate market value. As SOFR rates are observable at commonly quoted intervals, our debt under the 2024 Credit Facilities (as defined below) is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of our fixed rate debt does not exceed the carrying amount.
We did not transfer any assets or liabilities among the levels within the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
Non-recurring fair value measurements
Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and operating lease ROU assets. These assets are recognized at fair value during the period in which an acquisition is completed or at lease commencement, from updated estimates and assumptions during the measurement period, or when they are considered to be impaired. These non-recurring fair value measurements, primarily for long-lived assets, intangible assets acquired and operating lease ROU assets, are based on Level 3 unobservable inputs. In the event of an impairment, we determine the fair value of these assets other than goodwill using a discounted cash flow approach, which contains significant unobservable inputs and, therefore, is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement. The unobservable inputs in the analysis generally include future cash flow projections and a discount rate. For goodwill impairment testing, we estimate fair value using market-based methods including the use of market capitalization and consideration of a control premium.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded noncash impairment charges of $
367.5
 million against certain intangible assets, noncash impairment charges 
of 
$
22.6
 million against certain previously capitalized software and content development costs, noncash impairment charges of $
3.1
 million against certain operating lease ROU assets and noncash impairment charges against certain property and equipment assets which were insignificant. See Notes 4, 7, and 11, respectively, to these consolidated financial statements for additional details.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded noncash impairment charges of $
5.6
 million against certain operating lease ROU assets and $
1.1
 million impairment charges against certain property and equipment assets. See Notes 11 and 7, respectively, to these consolidated financial statements for additional details.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded noncash impairment charges of $
2.3
 million against certain previously capitalized software development costs, $
2.0
 million against certain insignificant customer relationship intangible assets that were held for sale, $
1.0
 million against certain operating lease ROU assets and insignificant impairment charges against certain property and equipment assets. See Notes 11 and 7, respectively, to these consolidated financial statements for additional details.
There were no other non-recurring fair value adjustments during 2024, 2023 and 2022 except for certain business combination accounting adjustments to the initial fair value estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date from updated estimates and assumptions during the measurement period. See Note 3 to these consolidated financial statements for additional details.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded noncash impairment charges of $
2.3
 million against certain previously capitalized software development costs that reduced the carrying value of those assets to zero. The impairment charges were reflected in general and administrative expense on the statements of comprehensive loss. These impairment charges resulted primarily from our decision to accelerate the end of customer support for certain solutions.
Other changes to the gross carrying amount of software and content development costs were primarily related to qualifying costs associated with development activities that are required to be capitalized under the internal-use software accounting guidance such as those for our cloud solutions and online education curriculum, write-offs of fully amortized assets, and the effect of foreign currency translation.

2024 refinancing
On April 30, 2024, we entered into the Third Amendment to Credit Agreement (the "Amendment"), by and among us, the lenders party thereto and Bank of America N.A., as administrative agent (the "Agent"). The Amendment amends the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of October 30, 2020 (as previously amended, the "2020 Credit Agreement" and the 2020 Credit Agreement as amended by the Amendment, the “2024 Credit Agreement”), by and among us, the lenders from time-to-time party thereto and the Agent.
The Amendment amends the 2020 Credit Agreement to, among other things, (a) refinance the existing $
1.1
 billion credit facilities under the 2020 Credit Agreement to provide for new credit facilities in the aggregate principal amount of $
1.5
 billion consisting of (i) a $
700.0
 million revolving credit facility (the “2024 Revolving Facility”) and (ii) a $
800.0
 million term loan facility (the “2024 Term Facility” and together with the 2024 Revolving Facility, the “2024 Credit Facilities”), (b) extend the maturity date to April 30, 2029, (c) modify the definition of Applicable Margin (as defined below) and (iv) modify certain negative and financial covenants to provide additional operational flexibility. Upon closing, we borrowed $
800.0
 million pursuant to the 2024 Term Facility and $
208.2
 million pursuant to the 2024 Revolving Facility and used the proceeds to repay the outstanding principal balances of the term loans under the 2020 Credit Agreement (the "2020 Term Facilities"), and repay $
196.6
 million of outstanding revolving credit loans under the 2020 Credit Agreement (the "2020 Revolving Facility").
Certain lenders of the 2024 Term Facility participated in the 2020 Term Facilities and the change in present value of our future cash flows to these lenders under the 2020 Term Facilities and under the 2024 Term Facility was less than 10%. Accordingly, we accounted for the refinancing event for these lenders as a debt modification. Certain lenders of the 2020 Term Facilities did not participate in the 2024 Term Facility. Accordingly, we accounted for the refinancing event for these lenders as a debt extinguishment. Certain lenders of the 2020 Revolving Facility participated in the 2024 Revolving Facility and provided increased borrowing capacities. Accordingly, we accounted for the refinancing event for these lenders as a debt modification. Certain lenders of the 2020 Revolving Facility did not participate in the 2024 Revolving Facility. Accordingly, we accounted for the refinancing event for these lenders as a debt extinguishment.
We recorded an insignificant loss on debt extinguishment related to the write-off of debt discount and deferred financing costs for the portions of the 2020 Credit Agreement considered to be extinguished. This loss was recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss within other income, net.
In connection with our entry into the 2024 Credit Agreement, we paid $
6.5
 million in financing costs, of which $
1.6
 million were capitalized in other assets and, together with a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs from the 2020 Credit Agreement and prior agreements, are being amortized into interest expense over the term of the new facility. As of December 31, 2024, deferred financing costs totaling $
1.7
 million were included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. We recorded aggregate financing costs of $
3.6
 million as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of our debt liability, which related to debt discount (fees paid to lenders) and debt issuance costs for the 2024 Term Facility.

Summary of the 2024 Credit Facilities
The 2024 Revolving Facility includes (i) a $
50.0
 million letter of credit subfacility, (ii) a $
50.0
 million swingline subfacility and (iii) a $
150.0
 million sublimit available for multicurrency borrowings.
Under the 2024 Credit Facilities, dollar tranche revolving loans and term loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of the Company: (a) a base rate equal to the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 
0.50
%, (ii) the prime rate announced by Bank of America, N.A., and (iii) Term SOFR plus 
1.00
% (the “Base Rate”), plus an applicable margin as specified in the 2024 Credit Agreement (the “Applicable Margin”); (b) Term SOFR plus the Applicable Margin; or (c) the Daily SOFR Rate plus the Applicable Margin. The Applicable Margin shall be adjusted quarterly, varies based on our net leverage ratio and varies based on whether the loan is a Base Rate Loan (
0.375
% to 
1.500
%), or a Term SOFR Loan/Daily SOFR Loan (
1.375
% to 
2.500
%). The 2024 Credit Agreement also provides for a commitment fee of between 
0.250
% and

% of the unused commitment under the 2024 Revolving Facility depending on our net leverage ratio.
Under the 2024 Credit Facilities, designated currency tranche revolving loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the option of the Company: (a) the Designated Currency Daily Rate (as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement) plus the Applicable Margin; or (b) the Designated Currency Term Rate (as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement) plus the Applicable Margin. The Applicable Margin shall be adjusted quarterly and varies based on our net leverage ratio for both Designated Currency Daily Rate Loans and Designated Currency Term Rate Loans (
1.375
% to 
2.500
%).
We may prepay the 2024 Credit Agreement in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage costs with respect to certain types of loans.
Under the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement, we are entitled on one or more occasion, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to request an increase in the commitments under the 2024 Revolving Facility and/or request additional incremental term loans in the aggregate principal amount of up to the sum of (i) the greater of (A) $
360.0
 million and (B) 
100
% of EBITDA (as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement), plus (ii) at our option, up to an amount such that the net leverage ratio shall be no greater than 
3.50
 to 1.00. At December 31, 2024, our available borrowing capacity under the 2024 Credit Agreement was $
468.7
 million.
The 2024 Credit Agreement contains various representations, warranties and affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type. Financial covenants include a net leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with our debt covenants under the 2024 Credit Facilities.
Real estate loans
In August 2020, we completed the purchase of our global headquarters facility. As part of the purchase price, we assumed  the Seller’s obligations under two senior secured notes with a then-aggregate outstanding principal amount of $
61.1
 million (collectively, the “Real Estate Loans”). The Real Estate Loans require periodic principal payments and the balance of the Real Estate Loans are due upon maturity in April 2038. At December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with our debt covenants under the Real Estate Loans.
Other debt
From time to time, we enter into third-party financing agreements for purchases of software and related services for our internal use. Generally, the agreements are non-interest-bearing notes requiring annual payments. Interest associated with the notes is imputed at the rate we would incur for amounts borrowed under our then-existing credit facility at the inception of the notes. Our assumption of these loans are noncash financing transactions and are reflected in our supplemental disclosure of cash flow information.

10. Derivative Instruments
We generally use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk. We currently have derivatives classified as cash flow hedges and net investment hedges. We do not enter into any derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
All of our derivative instruments are governed by International Swap Dealers Association, Inc. master agreements with our counterparties. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have presented the fair value of our derivative instruments at the gross amounts in the consolidated balance sheet as the gross fair values of our derivative instruments equaled their net fair values.
Cash flow hedges
We have entered into interest rate swap agreements, which effectively convert portions of our variable rate debt under the 2024 Credit Facilities to a fixed rate for the term of the swap agreements. We designated each of the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges at the inception of the contracts. Our entry into the 2024 Credit Agreement in April 2024 did not affect our interest rate swap agreements, including their designation as cash flow hedges, as the 2024 Credit Agreement has substantially the same critical terms as the 2020 Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate notional values of the interest rate swaps were $
700.0
 million and $
935.0
 million, respectively. All of the contracts have maturities on or before October 2028.

Blackbaud, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
We have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge revenues denominated in the Canadian Dollar ("CAD") against changes in the exchange rate with the United States Dollar ("USD"). We designated each of these foreign currency forward contracts as cash flow hedges at the inception of the contracts. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate notional values of the foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges that we held to buy USD in exchange for Canadian Dollars were $
32.8
 million CAD and $
29.9
 million CAD, respectively. All of the contracts have maturities of 12 months or less.
Net investment hedges
We have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure that arises on translation of our investments denominated in British Pounds ("GBP") into USD. We designated each of these foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges at the inception of the contracts. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate notional values of the foreign currency forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to reduce the volatility of the U.S. dollar value of a portion of our GBP-denominated investments was £
12.9
 million and £
13.2
 million, respectively.

Our policy requires that derivatives used for hedging purposes be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) includes unrealized gains or losses from the change in fair value measurement of our derivative instruments each reporting period and the related income tax expense or benefit. Excluding net investment hedges, changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments and the related income tax expense or benefit are reflected as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the actual hedged expense is incurred or until the hedge is terminated at which point the unrealized gain (loss) and related tax effects are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to current earnings. For net investment hedges, changes in the fair value measurements of the derivative instruments and the related income tax expense or benefit are reflected as adjustments to translation adjustment, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), and recognized in earnings only when the hedged GBP investment is liquidated. The estimated accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2024 that is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months is $
5.0
 million. There were 
no
 ineffective portions of our interest rate swap or foreign currency forward derivatives during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. See Note 14 to these consolidated financial statements for a summary of the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component. We classify cash flows related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
We did 
no
t have any undesignated derivative instruments during 2024, 2023 and 2022.
11. Commitments and Contingencies
Leases
We have operating leases for corporate offices, subleased offices and certain equipment and furniture. As of December 31, 2024, we did not have any operating leases that had not yet commenced.

Other commitments
The term loans under the 2024 Credit Facilities require periodic principal payments. The balance of the term loans and any amounts drawn on the revolving credit loans are due upon maturity of the 2024 Credit Facilities in April 2029. The Real Estate Loans also require periodic principal payments and the balance of the Real Estate Loans are due upon maturity in April 2038.
We have contractual obligations for third-party technology used in our solutions and for other services we purchase as part of our normal operations. In certain cases, these arrangements require a minimum annual purchase commitment by us. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining aggregate minimum purchase commitment under these arrangements was approximately $
184.4
 million through 2029.
Solution and service indemnifications
In the ordinary course of business, we provide certain indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our solutions or services. We have not identified any losses that might be covered by these indemnifications
Legal proceedings
We are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, as well as certain other non-ordinary course proceedings, claims and investigations, as described below. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a material liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If only a range of estimated losses can be determined, we accrue an amount within the range that, in our judgment, reflects the most likely outcome; if none of the estimates within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the low end of the range. For proceedings in which an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible but not probable and an estimate of the loss or range of losses arising from the proceeding can be made, we disclose such an estimate, if material. If such a loss or range of losses is not reasonably estimable, we disclose that fact. We review any such loss contingency accruals at least quarterly and adjust them to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. We recognize insurance recoveries, if any, when they are probable of receipt. All associated costs due to third-party service providers and consultants, including legal fees, are expensed as incurred.
Legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable. However, we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending or threatened against us and intend to defend ourselves vigorously against all claims asserted. It is possible that our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially negatively affected in any particular period by an unfavorable resolution of one or more of such legal proceedings.
Security incident
As previously disclosed, we are subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of a ransomware attack against us in May 2020 in which a cybercriminal removed a copy of a subset of data from our self-hosted environment (the "Security Incident"). Based on the nature of the Security Incident, our research and third party (including law enforcement) investigation, we do not believe that any data went beyond the cybercriminal, has been misused, or has been disseminated or otherwise made available publicly.
As a result of the Security Incident, we are currently subject to certain legal proceedings and claims, as discussed below, and could be the subject of additional legal proceedings, claims, inquiries and investigations in the future that might result in 
96

adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other resolution. To limit our exposure to losses related to claims against us, including data breaches such as the Security Incident, we maintain $
50
 million of insurance abo
ve a $
250
 thousand deductible payable by us. As noted below, this coverage reduced our financial exposure related to the Security Incident in prior years.
We recorded expenses and offsetting insurance recoveries related to the Security Incident as follows:

Recorded expenses have consisted primarily of payments to third-party service providers and consultants, including legal fees, settlement of the previously disclosed SEC and multi-state Attorneys General investigation and Attorney General of the State of California investigation (discussed below), settlements of customer claims and accruals for certain loss contingencies. Not included in the expenses discussed above were costs associated with enhancements to our cybersecurity program. We present expenses and insurance recoveries related to the Security Incident in general and administrative expense on our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss and as operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Total costs related to the Security Incident exceeded the limit of our insurance coverage during the first quarter of 2022. We expect to continue to incur expenses related to our response to the Security Incident, resolution of legal proceedings, claims and investigations, including those discussed below, and our efforts to further enhance our cybersecurity measures. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred net pre-tax expense of $
13.7
 million related to the Security Incident, which included $
7.0
 million for ongoing legal fees. It also includes a settlement of loss contingencies of $
6.8
 million. Also, for the year ended December 31, 2024, we had net cash outlays of $
15.9
 million related to the Security Incident, which included ongoing legal fees and the $
6.8
 million paid during the third quarter of 2024 related to our settlement with the Attorney General of the State of California (discussed below). In line with our policy, legal fees are expensed as incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2025, we currently expect net pre-tax expense of approximately $
2.0
 million to $
3.0
 million and net cash outlays of approximately $
3.0
 million to $
4.0
 million for ongoing legal fees related to the Security Incident.
As of December 31, 2024, we have recorded approximately $
0.7
 million in aggregate liabilities for loss contingencies based primarily on recent negotiations with certain customers related to the Security Incident that we believe we can reasonably estimate in accordance with our loss contingency procedures described above. Our liabilities for loss contingencies are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. It is reasonably possible that our estimated or actual losses may change in the near term for those matters and be materially in excess of the amounts accrued, but we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate the possible additional loss.
There are other Security Incident-related matters for which we have not recorded a liability for a loss contingency as of December 31, 2024 because we are unable at this time to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss. Each of these matters could, separately or in the aggregate, result in an adverse judgment, settlement, fine, penalty or other resolution, the amount, scope and timing of which we are currently unable to predict, but could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

Customer claims.

To date, we have received approximately 
260
 specific requests from customers for reimbursement of expenses incurred by them related to the Security Incident, all of which have been fully resolved and closed or are inactive and are considered by us to have been abandoned by the customers. We have also received approximately 
400
 reservations of the right to seek expense recovery in the future from customers or their attorneys in the U.S., U.K. and Canada related to the Security Incident, none of which resulted in claims submitted to us and are considered by us to have been abandoned by the customers. We have also received notices of proposed claims on behalf of a number of U.K. data subjects, which have been fully resolved and closed or are inactive and are considered by us to have been abandoned by the data subjects. In addition, insurance companies representing various customers’ interests through subrogation claims have contacted us, and certain insurance companies have filed subrogation claims in court, of which 
two
 cases remain active and unresolved.
Customer constituent class actions
.
 Presently, we are a defendant in putative consumer class action cases in U.S. federal courts (which have been consolidated under multi district litigation to a single federal court) alleging harm from the Security Incident. The plaintiffs in these cases, who purport to represent various classes of individual constituents of our customers, generally claim to have been harmed by alleged actions and/or omissions by us in connection with the Security Incident and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys’ fees and other related relief.
On May 14, 2024, the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina (the "Court") issued a memorandum opinion and order (1) denying the multi district litigation plaintiffs' motion for class certification because of the plaintiffs' failure to meet their burden of proof as to ascertainability, (2) granting our motion to exclude the multi district litigation plaintiffs' expert on the issue of ascertainability, and (3) denying the multi district litigation plaintiffs' motion to exclude our expert on the issue of ascertainability. Further, the Court denied as moot all other pending motions. On July 30, 2024, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the plaintiffs' petition for permission to appeal the Court's ruling. This litigation remains ongoing.
In December 2024 and January 2025, judges in Ontario and British Columbia, respectively, approved a settlement between us and plaintiffs in putative consumer class actions cases in Canada. In January 2025, the insignificant settlement was paid to Canadian charities designated in the settlement agreement as cy pres recipients.
Governmental investigations.
 As previously disclosed, we were subject to an investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. We also responded to inquiries from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner in September 2020 and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada in October 2020. Although we have not received notices of the termination of any of these inquiries and investigations, we believe that they are no longer active.
On June 13, 2024, we agreed to a Final Judgment and Permanent Injunction with the Attorney General of the State of California (the "Final Judgment") relating to the Security Incident. This settlement fully resolved the last remaining U.S. state attorney general investigation into the Security Incident. Under the terms of the settlement, we agreed to comply with applicable laws; not to make misleading statements related to our data protection, privacy, security, confidentiality, integrity, breach notification requirements, and similar matters; and to implement and improve certain cybersecurity programs and tools. The terms of the settlement with California are generally consistent with those to which we agreed in settling with the other 49 state Attorneys General and the District of Columbia on October 5, 2023, as discussed below. As part of the settlement, we also paid a total of $
6.8
 million to the State of California. Nothing contained in the Final Judgment is intended to be, and shall not in any event be construed or deemed to be, an admission or concession or evidence of any liability or wrongdoing whatsoever on the part of Blackbaud or any fact or violation of law, rule, or regulation. For more information, see the Final Judgment and Permanent Injunction of the State of California, County of San Diego that was furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 14, 2024.
On May 20, 2024, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") finalized an Order (the “FTC Order”) evidencing its settlement with us in connection with the Security Incident. As part of the FTC Order, we were not fined and were not otherwise required to make any payment. Furthermore, we agreed to the FTC Order without admitting or denying any of the FTC’s allegations, except as expressly stated otherwise in the FTC Order. The settlement described in the FTC Order fully resolved the FTC investigation. For more information, see the form of proposed order that was furnished as Exhibit 99.2 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 2, 2024 and is identical in substance to the final FTC Order, and in Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024.
On October 5, 2023, we entered into separate, substantially similar Administrative Orders with each of 
49
 state Attorneys General and the District of Columbia relating to the Security Incident which fully resolved the previously disclosed multi-state

Civil Investigative Demand and the separate Civil Investigative Demand from the Office of the Indiana Attorney General relating to the Security Incident.
On March 9, 2023, we reached a settlement with the SEC in connection with the Security Incident that fully resolved the previously disclosed SEC investigation of the Security Incident.
On September 28, 2021, the Information Commissioner’s Office in the United Kingdom under the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018 notified us that it has closed its investigation of the Security Incident.
On September 24, 2021, we received notice from the Spanish Data Protection Authority that it has concluded its investigation of the Security Incident.
On January 15, 2021, we were notified by the Data Protection Commission of Ireland that it has concluded its investigation of the Security Incident.
For more information about these completed government investigations and related actions, see Note 11 to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024.
12. Income Taxes
We file income tax returns in the U.S. for federal and various state jurisdictions as well as in foreign jurisdictions including Canada, the U.K., Australia, Ireland and Costa Rica. We are generally subject to U.S. federal income tax examination for calendar tax years 2021 through 2024 as well as state and foreign income tax examinations for various years depending on statutes of limitations of those jurisdictions.

The decrease in our effective income tax rate for year ended December 31, 2024, when compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily attributable to the valuation allowance recorded in the current period. As of December 31, 2024, we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our U.S. deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities due to the combination of our cumulative pretax loss position and net deferred tax asset position resulting from our divestiture of EVERFI. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our U.S. net deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. Furthermore, the effect of our various rate drivers is reversed by the Company’s 2024 loss position versus income in 2023.

11.8
 million, $
0.7
 million and $
42.7
 million, respectively. Of our federal net operating loss carryforwards, $
9.4
 million are subject to expiration beginning in 2025 while the remainder have an unlimited carryforward period. The state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various applicable state tax laws. If not utilized, the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire over various periods beginning in 2025. Our foreign net operating loss carryforwards have an unlimited carryforward period. Our state tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $
31.3
 million, net of federal benefit. If not utilized, the state tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025. We also have federal and state capital loss carryforwards of $
30.2
 million expiring in 2029. The foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforward and state credit carryforwards have a valuation reserve due to management's uncertainty regarding the future ability to use such carryforwards.

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefit that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate was $
5.2
 million at December 31, 2024. Certain prior period amounts relating to our 2014 acquisitions were covered under indemnification agreements and, therefore, had a corresponding indemnification asset. Due to lapse of statute of limitations, the indemnified unrecognized tax benefit was released in 2022 resulting in income tax benefit with offsetting expense included in pretax income from corresponding release of indemnification asset. We recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The total amount of accrued interest and penalties included in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was $
0.9
 million and insignificant, respectively. The total amount of interest and penalties included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss as an increase or decrease in income tax expense for 2024 was $
0.8
 million and for 2023 and 2022 was insignificant.
We have taken federal and state tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits might decrease within the next twelve months. This possible decrease could result from the expiration of statutes of limitations. The reasonably possible decrease at December 31, 2024 was insignificant.
For our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, we concluded that these earnings would be permanently reinvested in the local jurisdictions and not repatriated to the United States except to the extent that said earnings are of previously taxed income. Accordingly, we have not provided for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on those undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.
13. Stock-based Compensation
Employee stock-based compensation plans
Under the 2016 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan Amended and Restated as of June 12, 2024 (the "2016 Equity Plan"), we may grant incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, other stock awards and cash incentive awards to employees, directors and consultants. Our Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers this plan and the stock-based awards are granted under terms determined by it.
The total number of authorized stock-based awards available under our plan was 
3,823,058
 as of December 31, 2024. We issue common stock from our pool of authorized stock upon exercise of stock options and stock appreciation rights, vesting of restricted stock units or upon granting of restricted stock.

Awards granted to our executive officers and certain members of management are subject to accelerated vesting upon a change in control as defined in the employees’ employment agreement or retention agreement.
Expense recognition
We recognize compensation expense associated with stock options and awards with performance or market based vesting conditions on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period of the individual grantees, which generally equals the vesting period. We recognize compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards and SARs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the individual grantees, which generally equals the vesting period. We recognize the effect of awards for which the requisite service period is not rendered when the award is forfeited (that is, we recognize the effect of forfeitures in compensation cost when they occur). Previously recognized compensation cost for an award is reversed in the period that the award is forfeited.
Stock-based compensation expense is allocated to cost of revenue and operating expenses on the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss based on where the associated employee’s compensation is recorded.

Restricted stock awards
We have granted shares of common stock subject to certain restrictions under the 2016 Equity Plan. Restricted stock awards granted to employees vest in equal annual installments generally over 
three years
 from the grant date subject to the recipient’s continued employment with us. Restricted stock awards granted to non-employee directors vest after one year from the date of grant or, if earlier, immediately prior to the next annual election of directors, provided the non-employee director is serving as a director at that time. The fair market value of the stock at the time of the grant is amortized on a straight-line basis to expense over the period of vesting. Recipients of restricted stock awards have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends, if declared.

14. Stockholders' Equity
Preferred stock
Our Board of Directors may fix the relative rights and preferences of each series of preferred stock in a resolution of the Board of Directors.
Stock repurchase program
Under our stock repurchase program, we are authorized to repurchase shares from time to time in accordance with applicable laws both on the open market, including under trading plans established pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of repurchases depends on several factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of our common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Under the 2024 Credit Agreement, we have restrictions on our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock, which are summarized on page 
56
 in this report.
We account for purchases of treasury stock under the cost method. On January 17, 2024, our Board of Directors reauthorized, expanded and replenished our stock repurchase program by expanding the total capacity under the program from $
250.0
 million to $
500.0
 million available for repurchases. 
In March 2024, we entered into an issuer forward repurchase transaction with a large financial institution to repurchase an aggregate $
200 million
 of shares of our common stock (the 
"ASR Transaction"). Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Transaction, we provided the financial institution with a prepayment of $
200
 million and received an initial delivery of 
2.1
 million shares of our common stock, representing approximately 
70
% of the total shares then-expected to be repurchased under the ASR Transaction. The final number of shares of common stock delivered to us under the ASR Transaction was based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of the common stock during the term of the ASR Transaction, less a discount and subject to customary adjustments upon events affecting the common stock (e.g., dilutive or concentrative events, mergers and acquisitions, and market disruptions). We funded the ASR Transaction prepayment with borrowings pursuant to a revolving credit loan under the then effective 2020 Credit Agreement. On October 29, 2024, in connection with the settlement of the ASR Transaction, we received approximately 
490,000
 shares of our common stock, in addition to the 
2.1
 million shares received in March 2024. The difference
 of $
9.2
 million be
tween the prepayment of $
200
 million and the value of the shares repurchased on the ASR Transaction is classified as a reduction to additional paid-in capital within our consolidated statement of stockholders' equity. No cash was exchanged as part of the settlement of the ASR Transaction.
On July 16, 2024, our Board of Directors reauthorized, expanded and replenished our stock repurchase program by expanding the total capacity under the program from $
500.0
 million to $
800.0
 million available for repurchases.

15. Defined Contribution Plan
We have a defined contribution 401(k) plan (the "401K Plan") covering substantially all employees. Employees were able to contribute between 
1
% and 
75
% of their salaries in 2024, 2023 and 2022. We match 
50
% of qualified employees’ contributions up to 
6
% of their salary. The 401K Plan also provides for additional employer contributions to be made at our discretion. Total matching contributions to the 401K Plan for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $
8.2
 million, $
7.8
 million and $
9.3
 million, respectively. 
There were 
no
 discretionary contributions by us to the 401K Plan in 2024, 2023 and 2022.
16. Segment Information
We have 
one
 operating segment and 
one
 reportable segment. Our CODM is our chief executive officer ("CEO"), who reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by disaggregated information about our revenue, for purposes of making decisions about assessing financial performance and allocating resources. Our CEO considers costs of revenue, sales, marketing and customer success, research and development, and general and administrative expense categories on our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss as significant. Our CEO uses consolidated operating margin and net income as the primary measures of profit or loss. These financial metrics are used by our CEO to make key operating decisions, such as the allocation of budget between costs of revenues and our different operating expense categories.
Our other segment items include amortization, interest expense, other income, net, and income tax (benefit) provision on our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.

17. Revenue Recognition
Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations
As of December 31, 2024, approximately 
$
1.2
 billion
 of revenue is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately 
55
%
 of these remaining performance obligations over the next 
12
 months, with the remainder recognized thereafter.
We applied the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14 and have excluded the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services performed (transactional revenue).
Contract balances
Our contract assets as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were insignificant. 
Our closing balances of deferred revenue were as follows:

Total deferred revenue
$
361,544

$
394,927

The decrease in deferred revenue during 2024 was primarily due to our divestiture of EVERFI on December 31, 2024. Historically, due to the timing of customer budget cycles, we have an increase in customer contract renewals at or near the beginning of our third quarter. Generally, our lowest balance of deferred revenue during the year is at the end of our first quarter. The amount of revenue recognized during 2024 that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period was approximately 
$
376
 million
. The amount of revenue recognized during 2024 from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was 
insignificant
.
Disaggregation of revenue
We sell our cloud solutions and related services in three primary geographical markets: to customers in the United States, to customers in the United Kingdom and to customers located in other countries.

18. Subsequent Events
Release from Washington, DC lease
In February 2025, we made a one-time cash release payment of $
28
 million to the lessor in connection with a release from our lease for office space in Washington, DC (which was acquired as part of our acquisition of EVERFI in December 2021). Due to our remote-first workforce strategy, we had not used the office space since February 2023 and had subleased a portion of the space.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) are designed only to provide reasonable assurance that they will meet their objectives. As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide the reasonable assurance discussed above.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
No changes in internal control over financial reporting occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024 with respect to our operations that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the framework in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework)
. Based on this evaluation under the 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

An SEC "Rule 10b5-1(c) trading arrangement" is a trading arrangement made by a person through entering into a binding contract, verbal instruction or adoption of a written plan prior to becoming aware of material non-public information. The contract, instruction or written plan must specify the amount, price and date of securities to be sold; include the means for determining the amount, price and date of the sale or sales; and not permit the person to have subsequent influence over the sale or sales. The compliant plan must be entered into and operated in good faith, include a specified cooling off period, be certified by an authorized officer and is restricted from having multiple or overlapping plans. A non-compliant trading arrangement, or a "non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement," is a trading arrangement that has similar requirements to a Rule 10b5-1(c) trading arrangement except that it must be in written form and does not require a cooling off period or certification of an authorized officer and there is no restriction from having multiple or overlapping plans.
