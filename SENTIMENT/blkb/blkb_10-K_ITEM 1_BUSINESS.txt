ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Description of Business
We are the leading software provider exclusively dedicated to powering social impact. Serving the nonprofit and education sectors, companies committed to social responsibility and individual change makers, our essential software is built to accelerate impact in fundraising, nonprofit financial management, digital giving, grantmaking, corporate social responsibility and education management. Blackbaud brings over four decades of leadership to this sector: since originally incorporating in New York in 1982 and later reincorporating as a South Carolina corporation in 1991 and as a Delaware corporation in 2004. Millions of people across more than 100 countries connect, give, learn and engage through Blackbaud platforms. During 2024, we had nearly 100,000 customers that paid Blackbaud through transactional fees and approximately 40,000 customers with contractual billing arrangements. We are deeply proud to play a part in our customers’ success in their missions to provide healthcare and cure diseases, advance education, preserve and share arts and culture, protect the environment, support those in need and much more.
Market Overview
The social impact market is significant, spanning far beyond philanthropy, and our addressable market is substantial
There are millions of organizations globally focused on social impact including nonprofits, foundations, education institutions and healthcare organizations. In the corporate sector, demonstrating positive social impact has become a business imperative. Countless individuals also engage in social impact by donating funds, volunteering their time, advocating for a cause, receiving services from or otherwise engaging with social impact organizations.
Traditional methods of fundraising and organizational management are often costly and inefficient
Many social impact organizations use manual methods or software applications not specifically designed for fundraising or nonprofit business operations. Such methods are often costly and inefficient because of the difficulties in effectively collecting, sharing and using donation-related information. Furthermore, general purpose software applications frequently have limited functionality for the unique needs of our customer base and do not efficiently integrate multiple databases. Some social impact organizations have developed proprietary software, but doing so is expensive, requiring on-site technical personnel for development, implementation and maintenance.
The nonprofit industry faces particular operational challenges
Nonprofit organizations — and any other entity that includes fundraising as a revenue source, including education institutions, healthcare organizations and houses of worship — must efficiently:
•
Solicit funds and build relationships with major and institutional donors;
•
Garner small cash contributions from numerous contributors;
•
Manage and develop complex relationships with large numbers of constituents;
•
Communicate their accomplishments and the importance of their mission online and offline;
•
Comply with complex accounting, tax and reporting requirements that differ from those for for-profit businesses;
•
Solicit cash and in-kind contributions from businesses to help raise money or deliver products and services;
•
Provide a wide array of programs and services to individual constituents and beneficiaries; and
•
Improve the data collection and information sharing capabilities of their employees, volunteers and donors by creating and providing distributed access to centralized databases.
Because of these challenges, we believe nonprofits, education institutions, healthcare organizations and houses of worship can benefit from software applications and services specifically designed to serve their particular needs and workflows to grow revenue, work effectively and accomplish their missions.

Strategy
Our objective is to maintain and extend our position as the leading provider of cloud software and services essential for the core business operations unique to social impact organizations, teams, and schools. Our key strategies for achieving this objective are described below.
Execute on our Five Key Operational Initiatives
In early 2023, we outlined five key operational initiatives targeted to drive innovation, bookings growth, revenue expansion and lower costs. During 2024, we continued to execute on these key initiatives.
1.
Product Innovation and Delivery
To maintain our market leadership position, we are accelerating the pace of innovation and new feature delivery to our customers. Our focus has been on two areas, artificial intelligence (AI) and enhancements that continue to improve the connectivity of our suite of solutions. These enhancements are aimed at improving fundraising outcomes while reducing the administrative burden of our end users. Some examples include:
•
We have released a number of AI capabilities in our solutions, including generative AI functionality for our JustGiving platform. During 2024, we released generative AI capabilities for Raiser’s Edge NXT®, and we expect that Blackbaud Copilot will be available to our Raiser's Edge NXT customers soon. Using Blackbaud Copilot, users can ask ad hoc questions such as “How can I improve my average donation size?” and the tool will provide intelligent responses as well as recommended actions intended to drive that outcome.
•
During 2024, our Online Giving and Prospect Insights capabilities were natively integrated into Raiser's Edge NXT. With these integrations, fundraising administrators can now drive a giving campaign, keep records of each donor interaction, identify new donation opportunities, and provide personalized messaging, all in one integrated experience.
•
During 2024, we released our new optimized donation forms for Raiser's Edge NXT, Blackbaud CRM and Blackbaud Altru that fully integrate with our payment processing and CRM software. We expect these forms to drive higher revenue for our customers and for Blackbaud.
We are delivering more innovation, evolving our products and ensuring our customers receive more value from our solutions.
2.
Bookings Growth and Acceleration
We maintain a keen focus on accelerating bookings growth by signing new logos as well as upselling and cross-selling our existing customer base. Our sales team is split between prospect account executives dedicated to prospecting for new clients and customer account executives who focus on selling additional products to current customers. Given the 
4
2024 Form 10-K
Table of Contents
Blackbaud, Inc.
breadth of our product portfolio, this “land and expand” model has proven successful for us over time. As previously disclosed, there can be volatility quarter-to-quarter on bookings.
3.
Transactional Revenue Optimization and Expansion
Transactional revenue, which is about one-third of total revenue, is comprised of four primary components: donation processing (~55% of total transactional revenue); consumer giving (~20%); tuition management (~20%); and event-based usage (~5%). The diversity of the underlying transaction volumes from these four sources has resulted in consistent transactional recurring revenue growth in the mid-to-high single digits over the past several years. We continue to see strong momentum in consumer giving and tuition management, we have implemented rate increases across select areas of our payments portfolio, and we continue to implement additional payments solutions optimization to drive enhanced donor experience.
4.
Modernized Approach to Pricing and Multi-Year Contracts
In the summer of 2022, we put in place an updated pricing policy primarily for our social sector customers that directly reflects the value we provide to them, is in-line with the broader market and reflects the inflationary pressures that all businesses are facing. This program is designed to deliver sustained revenue growth beyond the initial three-year renewal cycle and will provide us with improved revenue visibility. As previously disclosed, this new approach has three main components: offering 3-year contract renewal terms as our standard, which the vast majority of customers are adopting; embedded annual price increases within the 3-year renewal term, which we have not had previously and are beginning to take effect; and a larger first year price increase to bring our pricing in-line with the broader market.  
The first two components, as well as a portion of the third, will continue on beyond the initial renewal cycle, creating what we believe will be a sustainable source of revenue growth.
We have now completed the 2023 and 2024 renewal cohorts, which represented approximately 65% of the total contractual revenue eligible for this program. Approximately another 25% of the renewable base is up for renewal in 2025, and the remaining 10% in the beginning of 2026. The close day-to-day management of renewals, the mix of 3-year and 1-year contracts, and the impact of pricing are progressing well. Additionally, the adoption of 3-year renewals as a standard, with more customers opting for this option than we originally expected, is expected to have an added benefit of higher retention which provides greater revenue assurance and predictability.
5.
Keen Attention to Cost Management
Cost management initiatives already completed drove a significant improvement in profitability during 2023. These initiatives included:
•
A reduction in headcount from approximately 3,600 in the third quarter of 2022 to approximately 3,000 as of December 31, 2023
•
Continued IT consolidation as we migrate customers from legacy private data centers to leading public cloud service providers. We closed four legacy data centers during 2022 and two in 2023.
•
Renegotiated key vendor contracts including Microsoft Azure and AWS
•
Reduced our real estate footprint as part of the shift to a remote-first workforce
During 2024, we continued to run the business at about the same headcount level, while continuing to drive efficiencies in other areas of the business. After the divestiture of EVERFI on December 31, 2024, we had approximately 2,600 employees.
As a remote-first workforce company, we can be strategic about selecting the appropriate geographic region for various functions in order to reduce costs without negatively impacting the quality of our products and services. For example, we are currently expanding our operations in India, which we expect will give us greater access to talent, and increase the number of our employees, including management, in India. We have rented office space in India to accommodate those new operations, although we do not currently expect to generate revenue in India in the foreseeable future.
There are two remaining legacy data centers that we are currently working towards closing in the future.

Attract and Retain Top Talent and Actively Engage Employee Base
Our employees are energized by our opportunity to fuel social impact. Collaboration, innovation, authentic passion for the customers we serve and high standards are core to our culture and help to enable the great work we do. We strive to hire, develop and retain the best employees and provide a supportive and inclusive environment where their talents and potential are realized. In 2021, we formally rolled out a remote work strategy as a company, which supports Blackbaud's goal to attract top talent globally. For additional information, see “Human Capital Resources” below.

With powerful data intelligence and expertise inside, and an ever-growing network of partners and developers outside, our software is the foundational infrastructure that expands what is possible for anyone dedicated to purpose-driven work.
We augment our software with a range of payment processing, analytic and business intelligence services, consulting, training and professional services, as well as maintenance and technical support.

We are developing and implementing AI features in certain of our solutions and services as a key element of our strategy to delight our customers and remain a market leader in the social impact sector. For example, our “Intelligence for Good” program integrates several machine learning and AI capabilities that help our customers streamline workflows, enhance efficiency and achieve better outcomes. We have introduced generative AI features across multiple products, mainly for composing outreach communications, and will soon be offering the ability for our customers to provide contextual responses to question and answer actions. We are also leveraging AI to transform the way we work at Blackbaud and intend to continue

Blackbaud, Inc.
to identify, experiment and scale a range of solutions across marketing, customer success and engineering through applied AI. We are committed to developing and using AI responsibly and in accordance with rapidly developing laws and regulations, including with regard to the processing of personal data. The technologies underpinning these features are in the early stages of commercial use, and we are mindful that the success of any enhancements or new products depends on many factors, including its relevance to our customers, timely implementation and market acceptance. In addition, we regularly monitor new regulatory developments in applicable jurisdictions in order to identify and mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by our use of AI. Furthermore, many of our AI features may rely on third-party service providers, which requires that we continuously evaluate the quality and legality of their products and operations, as well as copyright and intellectual property issues. Our commitment to new and emerging AI technologies requires that we invest in the development and maintenance of various models, approaches and processes, as well as the development of protections and safeguards for the use of AI technologies and requires that we hire persons with specialized expertise. As a result, we regularly monitor all aspects of our AI strategy to ensure that it is implemented in a manner consistent with our enterprise risk management processes and other company policies and procedures. (See “Risk Factors” below for more information regarding the risks associated with our use of AI and the description below of our current uses of AI in our solutions and services.)

Table of Contents
Blackbaud, Inc.
Data Health
 solutions enhance and maintain constituent data so the customer is always working with accurate and up-to-date information. Examples of these solutions include: identifying outdated or invalid constituent addresses in the database and making corrections based on United States Postal Service data and using name and address matching to append additional contact or demographic data points to constituent records to support better segmentation and engagement.
Predictive Insights
 inform strategic decision-making and actions that increase efficiency and drive successful outcomes. Insights are extracted by combining customer data with licensed and proprietary data before leveraging advanced AI capabilities and expertise from Blackbaud’s dedicated team of data scientists. Examples of constituent insights include: predictive modeling that indicates the likelihood and capacity of a constituent making a gift, wealth screening software that uses publicly available records to build detailed wealth profiles of constituents and persona cluster segmentation that groups constituents based on shared traits with guidance for optimizing messaging to each group.
Fundraising Performance
 solutions help customers to assess their fundraising performance across donor segments, benchmark themselves against peer organizations and understand industry trends. These solutions provide a holistic view of donor performance that goes beyond standard campaign-based reporting, with key performance indicators related to acquisition, upgrading, retention and reactivation.

Competition
The market for software and related services targeting philanthropic-focused for-profit and nonprofit organizations is competitive and highly fragmented. For certain areas of the market, entry barriers are low, as general tools for small businesses can usually be configured to manage the most basic marketing, contact management, and accounting needs of social impact organizations. In parallel, as software development evolves from a highly-complex tradecraft with nuanced understanding of architectural patterns and discrete languages, to click-to-code and drag-and-drop development with natively cloud-based infrastructure, it becomes easier for competitors to quickly spin up basic applications to solve common problems. However, once basic needs are met, programs unique to social impact organizations like the stewardship of relationships and partnerships critical to major gift fundraising and community education; the cultivation and management of gifts and grants sponsorship; the intricacies of not-for-profit specific fund accounting; the multi-level networking required for peer-to-peer activism and employee engagement; and the sensitive data and reporting behind critical programs run by and for healthcare and education institutions ensure the ongoing need for highly specialized tools. These specialized applications have a higher barrier of entry as they require industry insight to accurately articulate the business workflow that generates the requirements for software products. Moreover, because social impact organizations rely heavily on relationships with and among their supporters, integration of systems drives value beyond mere efficiency. Hence, we believe our insight, the full spectrum of our current solutions and our ability to deliver future solutions make us a strong competitor. We expect to continue to see new entrants as focus on social investment solutions increases to satisfy Millennial and Gen Z donors, customers and employees, the barriers of entry continue to decline with natively cloud solutions and social impact organizations more readily require digital transformation of business processes and data-driven decision making.
Our competition falls into four primary categories:
•
Niche products
 are usually developed as a solution for a single problem at an organization and are adopted by similar organizations to solve a specialized need. These are typically offered by vendors who may have deep industry expertise but may not have the resources to expand beyond a specialized area. We believe we compete against these solutions by offering a set of integrated solutions rather than a single point solution, which we believe improves the overall customer experience and reduces organizational risk. In addition, our open platform allows integration to specialized applications so the opportunity for disruption from these competitors is minimized.
•
Vertical-specific solutions
 are offered by competitors seeking to meet the enterprise-wide needs of a specific sub-segment of the social impact community. Typically, these solutions are offered by vendors who may offer either a point solution or integrated suite of products used by a vertical. We believe we compete successfully against these competitors through a combination of our integrated suite of offerings and nationwide community networks within verticals where we compete, offering solutions with market leading robustness and reporting as well as the scale, reach, and reputation of our organization.

General business software vendors
, such as Microsoft, Oracle and Salesforce.com, compete with us in certain areas of our business. While there is a growing trend toward social investment that is prompting philanthropic solutions from these general business vendors, most do not have a complete nonprofit specific focus and, therefore, do not offer, or to our knowledge do not intend to offer, nonprofit-specific versions. However, there is a subset of general business software competitors who have introduced nonprofit-specific versions of their products. These products generally do not satisfy the needs of nonprofits from end-to-end as they were not designed to support the specific needs of nonprofits during the original architecture, design, and requirements elicitation phases; and several of the products introduced by general business software vendors have been subsequently pulled from market based on lack of adoption and customer satisfaction. We believe that the products that remain are not yet fully capable of meeting market needs without significant customization to transform general business products into nonprofit solutions often requiring the use of consultants to guide the implementation, without which, leave the adoption of general business software limited to very basic operations and simple needs. We believe our solutions compete successfully against general business software as a nonprofit’s needs grow more complex. As a result, we believe we can compete successfully to meet nonprofit-specific requirements, often integrating with general business platforms used for their more generalized operations.

Consumer-oriented fundraising platforms
, such as GoFundMe and Facebook compete with our business where consumers raise funds directly. To drive adoption of their platforms, these vendors rely on a combination of direct-to-consumer marketing, marketing to nonprofits who in turn market to their supporters, and marketing to intermediate entities such as an event sponsor who will market to participants. We believe we compete well in this market through a combination of positive brand recognition among all three of these groups and the combination of our consumer- and organization-oriented tools relative to those of the competition.

Less frequently, we compete with providers of traditional, non-automated fundraising service providers, including parties providing services in support of traditional direct mail or email campaigns, special events fundraising, peer-to-peer, telemarketing and personal solicitations. We believe we compete successfully against these traditional fundraising service providers, primarily because our solutions and services are more automated, more robust, more tailored to the needs of nonprofit organizations and more efficient.
Technology and Architecture
Our technology strategy consists of several key building blocks including cloud operations, developer tools, data intelligence and core services. We leverage multiple clouds in our architectures (including AWS and Azure) and have both single and multi-tenant solutions. The best-in-class infrastructure enables rapid innovation with high levels of reliability, availability and security, and lets Blackbaud evolve services over time at independent paces as tech trends and tools emerge. Blackbaud also provides a toolset for customers, partners, and developers to extend the Blackbaud SKY ecosystem. SKY API enables developers to augment Blackbaud solutions with industry-standard REST APIs, standards-based authentication protocols, and a best-in-class developer experience. SKY UX allows developers to create applications with the same consistent, cohesive user interface as Blackbaud’s native solutions using an open-source framework that implements Blackbaud design patterns and provides guidelines and tooling for the entire application lifecycle. Our Intelligence for Good® strategy affirms our commitment to AI that is convenient, powerful and responsible.
The development strategy for all Blackbaud cloud solutions emphasizes:
•
Flexibility
: Customers and partners can extend our component-based architecture to accommodate changing demands without modifying source code.
•
Adaptability
: The architecture of our applications allows us to easily add functionality or integrate with third-party applications to adapt to customer needs and market demands.
•
Scalability
: Scalable architecture and the performance, capacity and load balancing of our customers' industry-standard web servers and databases ensure that applications can scale to meet the needs of large organizations.
Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in various jurisdictions, as well as employee and third-party nondisclosure agreements and confidentiality procedures. We maintain many trademarks, including, but not limited to “Blackbaud,” “Raiser's Edge NXT” and “Luminate.” We currently have one active patent on our technology and have one pending patent application.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 2,600 employees, none of whom are represented by unions or are covered by collective bargaining agreements. This number reflects the decrease in headcount following our disposition of our EVERFI business in December 2024. We are not involved in any material disputes with any of our employees, and we believe that relations with our employees are strong.
We benefit from an engaged and driven employee base motivated to join the Company by our work to support organizations and individuals driving social impact. Our purpose attracts and retains talented, competitive applicants, with approximately 90% of employees citing the fact that Blackbaud operates in a socially responsible manner is important to them. This differentiator not only builds strong employee engagement but also helps us provide a higher level of service to our customers. With over 76% of employees volunteering with nonprofits annually and one in seven serving on a nonprofit board or committee, our direct experience enables our teams to better serve our customer base.
Blackbaud also attracts and promotes talented employees through effective and targeted recruiting strategies. In 2021, we formally rolled out a remote work strategy which expanded our pool of qualified applicants for roles and internal career progression and enabled Blackbaud's goal to attract and develop talent globally. We continue to find top talent that want the flexibility of this work strategy, and it serves as a cornerstone of our culture focused on trust and productivity.
Employee engagement is a focus at Blackbaud, and we continually work to understand what matters and to make our workplace better to attract, develop, and retain talent. Every manager at Blackbaud is required to take a multi-course

"Engagement Labs" training designed to equip them with the practical skills to ensure their teams are highly engaged. We assess and measure progress on engagement and growth opportunities at the individual level through quarterly check-ins focused on impact and learnings, as well as through a global career framework that guides employee progression on both management and individual contributor career paths. We also assess engagement on the team and company level through regular employee surveys as well as "Ask Anything" sessions with senior leaders and dedicated Q&A sessions during our global, company-wide Connect and Engage meetings. We enable employees to have opportunities for career development through on-demand and company-led trainings via our Learning Management System platform, DevelopU.
Our compensation framework is designed so that employees are compensated equitably and competitively, through base salary, variable pay, equity award opportunities and comprehensive benefit offerings. We also seek to support the whole person, through increased benefits and focus on overall well-being. Our employee population has embraced a digital first mindset, and we continue to enhance our offerings and education to drive employees to make consumer driven decisions to be proactive in their healthcare journey.
Ultimately, we believe that Blackbaud is an excellent place to work because we are energized by our opportunity to fuel social impact and committed to running our business in a way that amplifies the difference we make in the world. We govern our business ethically and contribute to causes and communities that matter to our employees through corporate philanthropy. We pursue sustainability, and we work every day to ensure our workplace is supportive, inclusive and engaging.
We offer an array of philanthropy programs aimed at engaging our employees in fueling social impact, including matching gifts, competitive grants that honor noteworthy examples of volunteerism, employee-led grant committees, skills-based volunteerism initiatives, as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) focused community programs.
Our commitment to inclusion and sustainability supports our efforts to attract, develop and retain a high-performing employee base. In 2023, we brought together the Talent Acquisition team with Inclusion and Corporate Social Responsibility teams under one leader within People and Culture. The company believes that it is essential to foster inclusion from the moment a candidate considers Blackbaud. This alignment continues our focus to amplify and accelerate the significant initiatives already in place at Blackbaud, including: a focus on allyship, mentoring and affinity groups. We have 11 employee-led affinity groups, including, but not limited to those that represent veterans, LGBTQ+, women in technology, women in sales, people of color, sustainability and/or those with a disability.
Blackbaud takes proactive measures to protect the environment, both in our internal sustainable business practices and our external engagements. As we did in 2021, 2022 and 2023, in 2024 we plan to achieve carbon neutrality across our business operations. We are committed to our continued efforts to reduce our emissions footprint and provide transparent annual social responsibility and sustainability reporting. Blackbaud was recognized by USA Today as one of America’s Climate Leaders in 2024.
Blackbaud was recognized by Newsweek as one of America's Most Responsible Companies 2024, Built In's Best Places to Work 2024, Time’s list of America’s Best Mid-size Companies 2024 and was distinguished as an OutLeadership Certified Supporter and 2024 Disability Employer by Disability Solutions.
