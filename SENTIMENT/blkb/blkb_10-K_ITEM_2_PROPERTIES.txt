ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
We own our LEED Gold certified global headquarters facility in Charleston, South Carolina, which consists of approximately 172,000 square feet. We believe that it is in good operating condition and adequately serves our current business operations. As a remote-first workforce company, we have leased a significant portion of the office space in our global headquarters facility. In October 2024, we signed a membership agreement for office space in Hyderabad, India to support our business operations in India. In February 2025, we were released from our lease for office space in Washington, DC (which was acquired as part of our acquisition of EVERFI in December 2021). For additional information, see Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements in this report.
