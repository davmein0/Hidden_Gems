Overview

We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing precision therapies for genetically defined diseases. Our approach is to design rational precision therapies that treat the underlying cause of disease and improve the lives of patients. Our most advanced program is bezuclastinib, also known as CGT9486, a highly selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is designed to potently inhibit the KIT D816V mutation as well as other mutations in KIT exon 17. In the vast majority of cases, KIT D816V is responsible for driving Systemic Mastocytosis (“SM”), a serious and rare disease caused by unchecked proliferation of mast cells. Exon 17 mutations are also found in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (“GIST”), a type of cancer with strong dependence on oncogenic KIT signaling. Bezuclastinib is a highly selective and potent KIT inhibitor with the potential to provide a new treatment option for these patient populations. We are developing bezuclastinib to treat patients living with Non-Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis (“Non-AdvSM”), Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis (“AdvSM”) and GIST. We also have an ongoing Phase 1 study of our novel internally developed FGFR2 inhibitor. In addition to bezuclastinib, the Cogent Research Team is developing a portfolio of novel targeted therapies to help patients fighting serious, genetically driven diseases initially targeting mutations in ErbB2, PI3Kα and KRAS.

The following is an illustration of the status of our current clinical and preclinical programs:

Our Pipeline

Bezuclastinib - SM

The vast majority of AdvSM and Non-AdvSM patients have a KIT D816V mutation. Patients with AdvSM have a significantly diminished lifespan with a median survival of less than 3.5 years. For patients with Non-AdvSM, while their lifespan is not impacted by the disease, these patients suffer from a poor quality of life and new treatment options are badly needed. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to bezuclastinib for the treatment of Mastocytosis.	

68

We expect to report top-line results from our SUMMIT trial in July 2025 and from our APEX trial in the second half of 2025, and we plan to submit the first bezuclastinib New Drug Application (“NDA”) by the end of 2025 for patients with SM.

In the first quarter of 2025, we expect to initiate an expanded access program in the United States for SM patients to receive investigational bezuclastinib after meeting certain eligibility criteria.

SUMMIT (Non-AdvSM)

SUMMIT is our registration-directed randomized, global, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-part Phase 2 clinical trial for patients with Non-AdvSM. The study is designed to explore the safety and efficacy of bezuclastinib in patients with moderate to severe Non-AdvSM, which includes Indolent Systemic Mastocytosis (“ISM”), Smoldering Systemic Mastocytosis (“SSM”) and Bone Marrow Mastocytosis. Based on the performance of bezuclastinib’s optimized formulation in the PEAK lead-in trial, as well as in a healthy normal volunteer study, the SUMMIT trial protocol was amended to allow for the optimized formulation to be introduced during the Phase 1b dose optimization phase. SUMMIT Part 1 completed enrollment in the third quarter of 2023, including over enrollment at 54 patients across Part 1a and Part 1b. SUMMIT Part 2 completed enrollment in the fourth quarter of 2024, including over enrollment at 179 patients. We expect to report top-line results in July 2025.

From the data collected in Part 1 of SUMMIT and in accordance with FDA guidelines, we have developed a novel patient reported outcomes measure (“PROM”) called Mastocytosis Symptom Severity Daily Diary (“MS2D2”). Based on literature review, patient and physician interviews, data from SUMMIT Part 1, and our interactions with the FDA, we believe our MS2D2 is a reliable, valid and fit-for-purpose PROM. The MS2D2 Total Symptom Score (“TSS”) is comprised of 11 items, and scored on a 0-110 scale. The primary endpoint of SUMMIT Part 2 is a comparison of week 24 mean absolute change from baseline in MS2D2 TSS between bezuclastinib and placebo. In June 2024, we announced a positive discussion with the FDA and that we reached alignment with the FDA on the use of MS2D2 in Part 2 of SUMMIT.

In February 2024, we presented data from SUMMIT Part 1b at the 2024 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Thirty-four patients were enrolled in Part 1b and were treated with either bezuclastinib or placebo plus best supportive care. These patients were evaluated for signs of clinical activity over 12 weeks, including well-accepted biomarkers of disease burden. Based on the totality of the results from SUMMIT Part 1, the data support 100 mg QD as the optimal dose of bezuclastinib in Part 2 of SUMMIT for patients with Non-AdvSM. After the initial 12-week period, all patients were given the opportunity to receive bezuclastinib in the SUMMIT Open Label Extension (“OLE”). In December 2024 at the 2024 American Society of Hematology (“ASH”) Annual Meeting, we presented updated data on the 27 patients who were randomized in either Part 1 or the OLE to receive the 100 mg QD dose.

At the 100 mg QD dose and as of the cut-off date of August 29, 2024, 89% of patients had >50% decrease in serum tryptase by four weeks of treatment with bezuclastinib and 95% of patients with elevated baseline tryptase achieved serum tryptase levels <20 ng/ml by week 24. Additionally, 84% of patients with baseline serum tryptase >11.4ng/ml achieved <11.4ng/mL by week 24.

After 24 weeks of active treatment, the 27 patients randomized to receive 100 mg QD were evaluated for signs of clinical activity using multiple PRO measures, including the Mastocytosis Symptom Severity Daily Diary (“MS2D2”) and the Mastocytosis Quality-of-Life (“MC-QoL”) scale. These patients reported at 56% mean improvement in TSS from baseline. Additionally, 76% of patients demonstrated >50% reduction from baseline in MS2D2 TSS with 88% of patients exceeding 30% reduction from baseline after 24 weeks. At 24 weeks of treatment, 31% of patients have already reduced or discontinued best supportive care (“BSC”) medications. These same patients saw a 49% mean improvement in MC-QOL Total Score at 24 weeks.

As of the data cutoff, August 29, 2024, the median duration of bezuclastinib treatment was 56 weeks for patients in the active arm and 40 weeks for placebo patients who crossed over to the OLE. The majority of treatment emergent adverse events were low grade and reversible with no treatment-related bleeding or cognitive impairment events reported. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were hair color changes and transaminase elevations. All patients experiencing elevated transaminases were asymptomatic and reversible: five patients resolved without any dose modifications and remained on study; two patients resolved with dose reduction and remained on study, one of whom re-escalated to the original dose; and two patients resolved following discontinuation. All of the safety data were previously reported at ASH 2024. There were no other discontinuations due to adverse events.

69

APEX (AdvSM)

APEX is our registration-directed global, open-label, multi-center, Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with AdvSM evaluating the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles of bezuclastinib. In April 2023, we initiated Part 2 of the APEX trial using the optimized formulation of bezuclastinib at 150 mg daily dose. An additional APEX cohort was initiated in the third quarter of 2023 and is designed to allow concomitant administration of bezuclastinib with azacitadine in patients with SM-AHN. We completed enrollment in APEX Part 2 in the first quarter of 2025 with 58 patients and expect to present top-line results in the second half of 2025.

In December 2024, at the 2024 ASH meeting, we reported updated positive clinical data from Part 1 of the APEX trial. Thirty-two patients were treated in Part 1 at one of four dose levels (50 mg BID, 100 mg BID, 200 mg BID or 400 mg QD). In 2024, we announced APEX Part 2 would be conducted at the optimized 150mg QD dose, which closely matches the exposure from 100 mg BID dose in APEX Part 1. Patients were enrolled with the following sub-types: seven patients with aggressive systemic mastocytosis (“ASM”), 23 patients with systemic mastocytosis with associated hematologic neoplasm (“SM-AHN”), and two patients with mast cell leukemia (“MCL”).

As of the cutoff date of October 11, 2024, 32 patients enrolled were evaluated for signs of clinical activity, 27 of whom were mIWG-MRT-ECNM evaluable. An objective response rate (“ORR”) of 52% (including complete remission (“CR”), CR with partial hematologic remission (“CRh”), partial remission (“PR”), and clinical improvement (“CI”)) was achieved, including 61% ORR for TKI-treatment-naïve patients. An ORR of 88% was achieved by pure pathological response (“PPR”) criteria. The median time to achieve response was 2.2 months and median duration of response has not yet been reached. Median progression-free survival (“PFS”) was not yet reached at median follow-up of 20 months and the PFS rate at 24 months was 82%.

 As of the cutoff date, 94% of patients achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in serum tryptase levels, with 100% of patients receiving at least two cycles of treatment achieving a ≥ 50% reduction and 66% of patients achieved a reduction of serum tryptase below 20 ng/ml. Additionally, 93% of KIT D9816V-positive patients achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in KIT D816V VAF and 100% of evaluable patients achieved ≥ 50% reduction in bone marrow mast cell burden, with 83% of patients achieving a complete clearance of mast cell aggregates.

As of the data cutoff date, bezuclastinib continues to demonstrate a differentiated safety and tolerability profile across doses. The majority of hematological adverse events were low grade and reversible. There have been no new treatment-related serious adverse events or discontinuations reported since ASH 2023. Twelve patients required dose reduction, eight of whom were treated at a 400 mg daily dose.

Bezuclastinib - GIST

We are also pursuing the development of bezuclastinib in combination with sunitinib as a potential second line treatment for patients living with GIST. GIST is a cancer frequently driven by KIT mutations, and resistance to currently available therapeutics is frequently associated with the emergence of other KIT mutations. First-line therapy for the vast majority of GIST patients is imatinib, followed by sunitinib monotherapy as the current second-line therapy for the majority of patients that eventually develop resistance to imatinib.

PEAK (GIST)

PEAK is our randomized open-label, global Phase 3 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bezuclastinib in combination with sunitinib compared to sunitinib alone in patients with locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic GIST who have received prior treatment with imatinib. The FDA and EMA have granted orphan drug designation to bezuclastinib for the treatment of GIST. Patient enrollment for the pivotal portion of the PEAK trial was completed in the third quarter of 2024. Based on strong global patient interest, a total of 413 patients were enrolled in the trial. In addition, we completed a pre-planned interim futility analysis, and the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (“IDMC”) recommended continuing the PEAK study without modification. This pre-specified analysis was based on an assessment of PFS as determined by independent central review and did not include the option for early stopping due to efficacy. Top-line results are expected by the end of 2025.

70

In June 2024, we presented updated positive clinical data from the lead-in portion of the PEAK trial at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting. As of the cutoff date, April 1, 2024, the 42 patients in Part 1 have been on study for a median of 15.3 months. The median progression-free survival (“mPFS”) on the combination of bezuclastinib and sunitinib was 10.2 months in all patients. In a subset of second-line GIST patients with only prior imatinib, a population that most closely resembles patients currently enrolling in the Phase 3 pivotal PEAK study, the data demonstrate a mPFS of 19.4 months. In addition, the ORR in all patients treated with bezuclastinib and sunitinib was 27.5% and in the subset of second-line patients the ORR was 33.3%, per investigator assessment. Combination treatment resulted in a disease control rate of 80% in all patients and 100% in second-line patients with prior imatinib only. As of the data cutoff, the combination of bezuclastinib and sunitinib does not appear to add to the severity of adverse events known to be associated with sunitinib monotherapy and is well-tolerated. The majority of treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”) were low-grade and reversible and discontinuations due to TEAEs remain limited.

In May 2024, we also announced the initiation of a new advanced Phase 2 clinical trial of bezuclastinib plus sunitinib in later line GIST patients that is being sponsored by the Sarcoma Alliance for Research through Collaboration and in collaboration with The Life Raft Group and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The open label, single arm Phase 2 trial is designed to evaluate the mPFS as well as the safety and tolerability of bezuclastinib plus sunitinib in 40 patients with GIST who have previously progressed on sunitinib. This trial is focused on later line patients that are not eligible for PEAK and have limited treatment options.

In in the first quarter of 2025, we initiated an expanded access program in the United States for patients affected with advanced, metastatic, and/or unresectable GIST, intolerant to imatinib or received prior imatinib therapy for treatment that resulted in disease progression, and who meet other inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Worldwide rights to develop and commercialize bezuclastinib are exclusively licensed from Plexxikon Inc., a member of the Daiichi Sankyo Group (“Plexxikon”). Under the terms of the license agreement, Plexxikon received an upfront payment and is eligible for additional development milestones of up to $7.5 million upon the satisfaction of certain clinical milestones and up to $25.0 million upon the satisfaction of certain regulatory milestones. During the second quarter of 2022, as a result of the progression of the PEAK study, the first clinical milestone was achieved, resulting in payment of $2.5 million to Plexxikon in June 2022. As of December 31, 2024, no other milestone payments have been made. Patents protecting bezuclastinib include composition of matter claims which have been issued in the US and other key territories and provide exclusivity through 2033 and potentially beyond through patent term extensions. In addition, we filed a patent application in 2023 seeking to protect our optimized formulation of bezuclastinib that is currently being used in all three of our ongoing clinical trials, which could potentially provide exclusivity through at least 2043.

CGT4859

Our research team is building a pipeline of small molecule inhibitors, with our first efforts aimed toward targeting currently undrugged mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor (“FGFR”). FGFR mutations are well-established oncogenic drivers in multiple diseases, but approved medicines fail to capture the full landscape of FGFR altered tumor types, with FGFR1-mediated hyperphosphatemia serving as the most common dose-limiting toxicity for pan-FGFR inhibitors. In April 2023, we reported preclinical data at the American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) 2023 Annual Meeting providing the first published evidence of CGT4859 a reversible, selective FGFR2 inhibitor with coverage of activating and emerging resistance mutations that spares inhibition of FGFR1. Preclinical data demonstrate a profile that delivers equipotent coverage across both key gatekeeper and molecular brake mutations (V564X, N549X) in FGFR2, while avoiding any evidence of FGFR1-linked hyperphosphatemia at efficacious plasma concentrations. In October 2023, we presented updated preclinical data at the 2023 EORTC-NCI-AACR International Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics (“EORTC-NCI-AACR”). Preclinical data demonstrate a profile that exhibits low namomolar potency on WT FGFR2 and FGFR2 mutations and is selective against the kinome, as well as a panel of ion channels and receptors. Exploratory pharmacokinetics studies conducted across species showed CGT4859 to be a low-clearance compound with high oral bioavailability. Further, in a mutant-driven mouse model, CGT4859 demonstrated dose-responsive tumor growth inhibition with complete regressions at 5 mg/kg PO and was well-tolerated. In addition, as a reversible inhibitor, the Cogent program retains enzymatic potency against potential cysteine 491 mutations. We are actively enrolling our Phase 1 study of CGT4859 in patients with FGFR2 mutations, including advanced cholangiocarcinoma. The trial will explore the safety, tolerability and clinical activity of escalating doses of CGT4859 with a goal of selecting an active and well tolerated dose for further clinical investigation.

Research Programs

The Cogent Research Team, based in Boulder, Colorado, is focused on pioneering best-in-class, small molecule therapeutics to expand our pipeline and deliver novel precision therapies for patients living with unmet medical needs. For ErbB2, PI3K and KRAS we see opportunities to provide a more robust molecular response compared to existing therapies.

ErbB2

Our research team is also advancing a novel, ErbB2 mutant program, which is focused on actionable and underserved mutations in a variety of solid tumor indications. In April 2023, we reported preclinical data at AACR describing a series of novel compounds which potently inhibit several key ErbB2 mutations, including YVMA insertions, while sparing inhibition of EGFR. An exemplar compound from these series demonstrates advantages versus tucatinib, an approved benchmark compound, on tumor growth inhibition in a peripheral ErbB2 L755S driven mutant model, as well as in an ErbB2 driven intracranial model. Recent program advances with a novel chemotype have further improved ErbB2 mutational potency and selectivity and improved human whole blood stability to nearly 24 hours, suggesting a favorable profile for optimal clinical efficacy. Updated data was presented in December 2024 at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (“SABCS”). The updated data presented shows that CGT4255 demonstrated low nM potency against ErbB2 wild-type and oncogenic ErbB2 mutations with greater than 100-fold selectivity over wild-type-EGFR. In addition to impressive selectivity across a broad range of kinases, receptors and ion channels, CGT4255 has exceptional half-life in human whole blood and liver cytosol fractions. Dose ascending PK data in mice showed low clearance and high oral bioavailability at all doses, with best-in-class 80% brain penetrance at 100 mg/kg. Maximum inhibition of ErbB2 was observed at a 30 mg/kg PO dose in both NIH/3T3 ErbB2-YVMA and ErbB2-L755S tumor models, with complete regressions at 100 mg/kg PO BID in the NIH3T3 ErbB2-L755S TGI model and was well tolerated. In addition, at the 2024 SABCS meeting, CGT4255 demonstrated robust efficacy in combination with T-DXd in an NCI-N87-luc Intracranial Her2+ Model, highlighting the ability to treat challenging intercranial tumors. These advances continue to highlight a favorable profile for optimal clinical efficacy. We selected our ErbB2 clinical candidate in 2024 and plan to submit an IND application in 2025.

PI3Kα

Our research team is also developing a potential best-in-class, wild-type-sparing, PI3Kα inhibitor that provides coverage for the H1047R mutation, which affects >30,000 cancer patients each year. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (“PI3K”) pathway is a key cell cycle regulating pathway that has an established role in tumor growth and development. PI3Kα mutations are highly prevalent in many solid tumors and are present in 36% of all breast cancer patients. The approved agents for these patients often lead to dose limitations, resulting from activity against wild-type PI3Kα. Preclinical data was presented at the 2024 EORTC-NCI-AACR meeting in October 2024 as well as the December 2024 SABCS, which highlighted that CGT6297 is an allosteric inhibitor of PI3K, was well-tolerated in the tumor growth inhibition efficacy models and has been profiled based on its selectivity for H1047R over WT PI3K. CGT6297 demonstrated low nM potency in H1047R mutant PI3K cell lines, differentiated dose ascending PK in mice with high bioavailability and low clearance. CGT6297 also showed >95% inhibition of pAKT in a H1047R PD model, without increases in insulin or C-peptide. Its efficacy profile was superior to a clinically-relevant dose of Alpelisib in the NCI H1048 mouse tumor growth inhibition model. CGT6297 has been selected as our clinical candidate for the PI3K 1047 mutation focused project. IND-enabling studies have been initiated and we expect to submit an IND application in 2025.

KRAS

Our research team is also developing a potent and selective KRAS inhibitor. Mutations in KRAS are among the most prevalent mutations found in cancer, occurring most often in colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. Preclinical data was presented at the 2024 EORTC-NCI-AACR meeting and highlighted our internally-developed pan KRAS(ON) inhibitor with selectivity over HRAS and NRAS and picomolar (pM) activity across KRAS mutations without the potential liabilities of molecules in the class. Following oral administration, CGT6737 demonstrated robust PK/PD and tumor growth inhibition with 90% PD inhibition in mouse xenograft models. Lead optimization of CGT6737 is ongoing.

Financial Operations Overview

Since our inception in 2014, we have focused significant efforts and financial resources on establishing and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research and development of our product candidates, manufacturing drug product material for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials, staffing our company, and raising capital. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. Our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product candidates. Our net loss was $255.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to net loss of $192.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $859.5 million. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect that our expenses and capital requirements will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if and as we:

•
initiate and increase enrollment for our existing and planned clinical trials for our product candidates;

•
continue to discover and develop additional product candidates;

•
acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies;

•
maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio;

•
hire additional research, clinical, scientific, and commercial personnel;

•
establish a commercial manufacturing source and secure supply chain capacity sufficient to provide commercial quantities of any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval;

•
seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;

•
establish a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and

•
add operational, financial, and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts.

We will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates and do not enter into a commercialization partnership, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our internal commercialization capability to support product sales, marketing, and distribution.

As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back, or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our product candidates.

Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical product development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate product sales, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations.

As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $287.1 million. Based on our current plans, we expect that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through clinical readouts from ongoing SUMMIT, PEAK, and APEX registration-directed trials and into late 2026.

Components of Our Results of Operations

Operating Expenses

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include:

•
expenses incurred in connection with the discovery, preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract research organizations (“CROs”);

•
the cost of manufacturing drug products for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants, contractors and contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”);

•
employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development functions;

•
laboratory supplies and animal care;

•
facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and insurance; and

•
payments made under third-party licensing agreements. 

We do not allocate employee costs, laboratory supplies, software and facilities, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We expense research and development costs as incurred. Advance payments that we make for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.

Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect that our research and development expenses will increase substantially in connection with our planned clinical and preclinical development activities in the near term and in the future. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the preclinical and clinical development of any of our product candidates. The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the following:

•
the timing and progress of our preclinical and clinical development activities;

•
the number and scope of preclinical and clinical programs we decide to pursue;

•
the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered, or may enter, into collaboration arrangements;

•
our ability to maintain our current research and development programs and to establish new ones;

•
the enrollment rates in our clinical trials;

•
our ability to establish new licensing or collaboration arrangements;

•
the future productivity of the Cogent Research Team in Boulder, CO and its ability to discover new product candidates and build our pipeline;

•
the successful completion of clinical trials with safety, tolerability, and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority;

•
the receipt of regulatory approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;

•
the success in establishing and operating a manufacturing facility, or securing manufacturing supply through relationships with third parties;

74

•
our ability to obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection, and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;

•
our ability to protect our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;

•
the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when approved;

•
the acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community, and third-party payors;

•
competition with other products; and

•
a continued acceptable safety profile of our therapies following approval. 

A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. We may never succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates.

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance, commercial and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include direct and allocated facility-related costs as well as professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, investor and public relations, accounting, and audit services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as a result of the costs associated with the expansion of operations to support our ongoing discovery, preclinical and clinical activities and current and future commercialization activities.

Interest Income

Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.

Other Income, Net

Other income consists of miscellaneous income and expense unrelated to our core operations, including income from subleasing a portion of our former headquarters facilities and a milestone payment related to the sale of our legacy assets.

Change in Fair Value of the CVR liability

This consists of changes in the fair value of the contingent value right (“CVR”) liability.

Income Taxes

Since our inception, we have not recorded any current or deferred tax benefit for the net losses we have incurred in each year or for our tax credits generated, as we believe, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits will not be realized. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established against the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024. We reevaluate the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits at each reporting period. As of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $268.1 million and $128.7 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income and begin to expire in 2035. Of the federal net operating loss carryforwards at December 31, 2024, $264.8 million is available to be carried forward indefinitely but we are permitted to offset a maximum of 80% of taxable income per year. As of December 31, 2024, we had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $19.7 million and $4.4 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2040 and 2035, respectively. We also had federal orphan drug tax credits of $25.7 million which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and begin to expire in 2041.

75

Utilization of the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and corresponding provisions of state law, due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period.

We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date.

Total research and development expense increased by $58.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, driven by the development of bezuclastinib, including costs associated with the accelerated completion of enrollment of the SUMMIT and PEAK trials and ongoing costs of the APEX trial, as well as the continued progression of our early stage, preclinical and discovery programs. There was also an increase in unallocated expenses driven by higher personnel costs due to an increase in headcount, including stock-based compensation expense which increased by $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

76

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $43.3 million, compared to $34.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher personnel and support costs due to the growth of the organization. This includes stock-based compensation expense, which increased by $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Additionally, the costs include initial commercial readiness activities initiated in the third quarter of 2024.

Interest Income

Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $18.1 million, compared to $13.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested balances in cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher interest rates in the current year compared to the prior period.

Other Income, Net

Other income, net was $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2024, other income represented a milestone payment received related to the 2020 sale of our legacy assets, while for the year ended December 31, 2023, other income primarily represented sublease income recognized resulting from the sublease of a portion of our former corporate headquarters space.

Change in fair value of CVR liability

The change in fair value of CVR liability for year ended December 31, 2024 was nil, compared to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. We recorded a decrease in fair value of the liability of $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2023, reducing the liability to zero as the probability of additional CVR payments occurring prior to the expiration of the CVR term was remote. The CVRs expired on August 6, 2023 and no further payments will be made to CVR holders.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. We have generated limited revenue to date from funding arrangements with our former collaboration partner. We have not yet commercialized any of our product candidates and we do not expect to generate revenue from sales of any product candidates for several years, if at all. We have historically funded our operations primarily through the public offering and private placement of our securities and consideration received from our collaborative agreements.

On May 6, 2022, pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, we entered into a Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with Guggenheim Securities, LLC (“Guggenheim Securities”), pursuant to which we may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million through Guggenheim Securities, as the sales agent. As of December 31, 2024, no shares have been sold under the Sales Agreement. In February 2025, we sold 2,587,992 shares under the Sales Agreement for gross proceeds of $25.0 million.

On February 10, 2023, we filed a Form S-3ASR with the SEC (“2023 Shelf Registration Statement”) for the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, rights, debt securities and units, which became effective immediately upon filing. At the time any of the securities covered by the 2023 Shelf Registration Statement are offered for sale, a prospectus supplement will be prepared and filed with the SEC containing specific information about the terms of any such offering.

In June 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering of 14,375,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $12.00 per share (including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their 30-day option to purchase up to 1,875,000 additional shares of common stock). The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $161.8 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.

On February 13, 2024, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) for a private placement (the “Private Placement”) with certain institutional and accredited investors (each, a “Purchaser” and collectively, the “Purchasers”). The closing of the Private Placement occurred on February 16, 2024. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers purchased (i) an aggregate of 17,717,997 shares of our common stock at a price per share of $7.50, and (ii) 12,280 shares of our Series B Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”), at a price per share of $7,500.00. Net proceeds were approximately $213.3 million after deducting placement fees and offering costs.

77

As of December 31, 2024, we have 135,552,039 shares outstanding on an as-converted basis, which consists of (i) 110,461,729 shares of common stock outstanding, (ii) pre-funded warrants that are exercisable for 606,060 shares of common stock, (iii) 70,465 shares of Series A Preferred Stock that are convertible into 17,616,250 shares of common stock and (iv) 6,868 shares of Series B Preferred Stock that are convertible into 6,868,000 shares of common stock.

As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $287.1 million, which we believe will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through clinical readouts from ongoing SUMMIT, PEAK, and APEX registration-directed trials and into late 2026.

Operating Activities

During the year ended December 31, 2024, operating activities used $207.8 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $255.9 million, partially offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $11.6 million and net non-cash charges of $36.5 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2024 consisted primarily of a $17.3 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in operating lease liabilities and a $4.3 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, operating activities used $153.6 million of cash, primarily resulting from our net loss of $192.4 million, partially offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $11.4 million and net non-cash charges of $27.3 million. Net cash used by changes in our operating assets and liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted primarily of a $13.0 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in operating lease liabilities, a $0.6 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $0.1 million increase in other assets.

Investing Activities

During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was $38.3 million, consisting of maturities and sales of marketable securities, partially offset by purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was $97.8 million, consisting of purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment, partially offset by maturities and sales of marketable securities.

Financing Activities

During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was $214.5 million, which consisted of $213.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and Series B Preferred Stock in the Private Placement, net of paid offering costs, proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon stock option exercises.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was $163.5 million, which consisted of $161.8 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock in an underwritten public offering, net of paid offering costs, proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon stock option exercises.

78

Funding Requirements

We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the clinical development of our current and any future product candidates and conduct additional research, development and preclinical activities. The timing and amount of our operating expenditures will depend largely on:

•
the initiation, progress, timing, and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our current and future potential product candidates;

•
any delay in our regulatory filings for our product candidates and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the applicable regulatory authority’s review of such filings, including without limitation the FDA’s issuance of a “refusal to file” letter or a request for additional information;

•
adverse results or delays in clinical trials;

•
our decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial, or to terminate an existing clinical trial;

•
 adverse regulatory decisions, including failure to receive regulatory approval of our product candidates;

•
changes in laws or regulations applicable to our products, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;

•
adverse developments concerning our manufacturers;

•
our inability to obtain adequate product supply for any approved product or our inability to do so at acceptable prices;

•
our inability to establish collaborations, if desired or needed;

•
our failure to commercialize our product candidates;

•
additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel; and

•
unanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of our product candidates.

Based on our current plans, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $287.1 million as of December 31, 2024 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through clinical readouts from ongoing SUMMIT, PEAK, and APEX registration-directed trials and into late 2026. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. We will require additional funding to complete the critical activities planned to support ongoing research and development programs.

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, and marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, existing ownership interests will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of common stockholders. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions or capital expenditures, or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances, or marketing, distribution, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or drug candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings or other arrangements when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our research, product development, or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market drug candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

79

Critical Accounting Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could have a material impact on our reported results. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements.

Accrued Research and Development Expenses

As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs. The majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed, on a pre-determined schedule or when contractual milestones are met; however, some require advance payments. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in the consolidated financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:

•
vendors in connection with the preclinical development activities; 

•
CMOs in connection with the production of preclinical and clinical trial materials; 

•
CROs in connection with preclinical studies and clinical trials; and 

•
investigative sites in connection with clinical trials. 

We base our expenses related to preclinical studies and clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotes and contracts with multiple CMOs and CROs that supply, conduct, and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract, and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period.

Stock-Based Compensation

We measure stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees, non-employees and directors based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognize compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. We apply the straight-line method of expense recognition to all awards with only service-based vesting conditions and apply the graded-vesting method to all awards with performance-based vesting conditions or to awards with both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions.

80

We estimate the fair value of our stock options granted to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including (a) the expected volatility of our stock, (b) the expected term of the award, (c) the risk-free interest rate, and (d) expected dividends. Due to the lack of a sufficient history of public trading of our common stock and a lack of sufficient company-specific historical and implied volatility data, we have based our estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in a similar stage of development as us and that are publicly traded. We will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available. We have estimated the expected term of our employee stock options using the “simplified” method, whereby, the expected term equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected life of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted. The expected dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We account for forfeitures as they occur.

We measure the fair value of stock-based awards with market-based vesting conditions on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation mode
l.

For performance-based stock awards, we begin to recognize expense when we determine that the achievement of such performance conditions is deemed probable. This determination requires significant judgment by management. At the date achievement becomes probable, we record a cumulative expense catch-up, with remaining expense amortized over the remaining service period. For awards with market conditions, the stock-based compensation expense will be recognized over the derived service period regardless of whether the award achieves the market condition and will only be adjusted to the extent the service condition is not met
.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

A description of our material cash requirements, including commitments for capital expenditures, is described above and disclosed in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

A description of recently issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.

ITEM 7A.	QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT
IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $287.1 million and $273.2 million, respectively, consisting primarily of money market funds and investments in U.S. government agency securities and treasury obligations.

Interest Rate Risk

We are subject to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio. We invest in marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy. The primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve capital, maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields. Our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue, issuer or type of investment. We place our excess cash with high credit quality financial institutions, commercial companies, and government agencies in order to limit the amount of credit exposure. Some of the securities we invest in may have market risk. This means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate.

81

Our investment exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our portfolio, changes in the market value due to changes in interest rates and other market factors, as well as the increase or decrease in any realized gains and losses. Our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities and instruments with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not significantly affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments, but may affect our future earnings and cash flows. We generally have the ability to hold our fixed-income investments to maturity and, therefore, do not expect that our operating results, financial position or cash flows will be materially impacted due to a sudden change in interest rates. However, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates, or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates or other factors, such as changes in credit risk related to the securities’ issuers. To minimize this risk, we schedule our investments to have maturities that coincide with our expected cash flow needs, thus avoiding the need to redeem an investment prior to its maturity date. Accordingly, we do not believe that we have material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments. Generally, our investments are not collateralized. We have not realized any significant losses from our investments.

We do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. We ensure the safety and preservation of invested principal funds by limiting default risk, market risk and reinvestment risk. We reduce default risk by investing in investment grade securities
.

Inflation Risk

Inflation generally impacts us by potentially increasing our operating expenses, including clinical trial costs. We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business or results of operations during the periods for which the consolidated financial statements are presented in this report. Significant adverse changes in inflation could negatively impact our future results of operations.

Report of Independent Regist
ered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Cogent Biosciences, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cogent Biosciences, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

84

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Accrued External Research and Development Expenses

As described in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has entered into various research and development contracts with companies both inside and outside of the United States. Management records accruals for estimated ongoing external research and development costs. When billing terms under these contracts do not coincide with the timing of when the work is performed, management is required to make estimates of outstanding liabilities to the third parties as of the end of the reporting period. When evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities, management analyzes progress of the studies or trials, including the phase or completion of events, communication from the contract research organizations or other companies of any actual costs incurred during the period that have not yet been invoiced, invoices received and contracted costs. Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Within accrued expenses and other current liabilities, total accrued external research and development expense is $20.0 million as of December 31, 2024.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to accrued external research and development expenses is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in developing the estimate of accrued external research and development expenses and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures related to management’s development of the estimate of accrued external research and development expenses.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s estimate of accrued external research and development expenses. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for developing the estimate of accrued external research and development expenses; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the method used by management to develop the estimate; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the estimate; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s estimate of accrued external research and development expenses by (a) testing the completeness and accuracy of costs incurred, on a sample basis, by tracing information to the underlying contracts, purchase orders, invoices and information received from contract research organizations or other companies, as applicable, and (b) evaluating the reasonableness of the estimated costs incurred for the services that have not been invoiced, on a sample basis, by tracing to underlying supporting documentation, such as underlying contracts, purchase orders and information received from contract research organizations or other companies, as applicable.

COGENT BIOSCIENCES, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Nature of the Business and Basis of Presentation
Cogent Biosciences, Inc. (“Cogent” or the “Company”) is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing precision therapies for genetically defined diseases. Cogent’s approach is to design rational precision therapies that treat the underlying cause of disease and improve the lives of patients. Cogent’s most advanced program is bezuclastinib, also known as CGT9486, a highly selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is designed to potently inhibit the KIT D816V mutation as well as other mutations in KIT exon 17. In the vast majority of cases, KIT D816V is responsible for driving Systemic Mastocytosis (“SM”), a serious and rare disease caused by unchecked proliferation of mast cells. Exon 17 mutations are also found in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (“GIST”), a type of cancer with strong dependence on oncogenic KIT signaling. Bezuclastinib is a highly selective and potent KIT inhibitor with the potential to provide a new treatment option for these patient populations. The Company is developing bezuclastinib in patients living with Non-Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis (“Non-AdvSM”), Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis (“AdvSM”), and GIST. The Company also has an ongoing Phase 1 study of its novel internally developed FGFR2 inhibitor. In addition to bezuclastinib, the Company’s research team is developing a portfolio of novel targeted therapies to help patients fighting serious, genetically driven diseases initially targeting mutations in ErbB2, PI3Kα and KRAS.
The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the biotechnology industry, including, but not limited to, development by competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations and the ability to secure additional capital to fund operations. Product candidates currently under development will require significant additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel and infrastructure and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities. Even if the Company’s drug development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will realize revenue from product sales.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of continuity of operations, realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business. The Company has incurred recurring losses since inception, including a net loss of 
$
255.9
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of 
$
859.5
 million. The Company expects to continue to generate operating losses in the foreseeable future. As of the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements, the Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months from issuance of the consolidated financial statements.
The Company expects that it will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with its ongoing business activities. The Company will need to seek additional funding through equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements or other marketing and distribution arrangements, partnerships, joint ventures, combinations or divestitures of one or more of its assets or businesses. The Company may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms, or at all, and the Company may not be able to enter into collaborative arrangements or divest its assets. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of the Company’s stockholders. Arrangements with collaborators or others may require the Company to relinquish rights to certain of its technologies or product candidates. If the Company is unable to obtain funding, the Company could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate its research and development programs or commercialization efforts, which could adversely affect its business prospects, or the Company may be unable to continue operations.
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). 

92

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Mono, Inc. and Kiq Bio LLC. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions reflected in these consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the accrual of research and development expenses, the valuation of the CVR liability and the valuation of stock-based awards. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, known trends and other market-specific or other relevant factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, as there are changes in circumstances, facts and experience. Actual results may differ from those estimates or assumptions.
Concentrations of Credit Risk and of Significant Suppliers

Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Periodically, the Company maintains deposits in accredited financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company maintains most of its cash and cash equivalents at two accredited financial institutions. The Company has not experienced any losses on such accounts and does not believe that it is subject to unusual credit risk beyond the normal credit risk associated with commercial banking relationships. Such deposits have and will continue to exceed federally insured limits.

The Company is dependent on third-party vendors for its product candidates. In particular, the Company relies, and expects to continue to rely, on a small number of vendors to manufacture supplies and process its product candidates for its development programs. These programs could be adversely affected by a significant interruption in the manufacturing process.

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of generally three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
Marketable Securities
The Company’s marketable securities, consisting of debt securities, are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale marketable debt securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders’ equity until realized. Any premium or discount arising at purchase is amortized and/or accreted to interest income and/or expense over the life of the instrument. Realized gains and losses are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other income (expense). The Company reviews its portfolio of available-for-sale debt securities, using both quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine if declines in fair value below cost have resulted from a credit-related loss or other factors. If the decline in fair value is due to credit-related factors, a loss is recognized in net income, and if the decline in fair value is not due to credit-related factors, the loss is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense is recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset as follows:

Estimated Useful Life

Laboratory equipment

5
 years

Computer equipment and software

3
 years

Furniture and fixtures

5
 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of life of lease or 
10
 years

93

Costs for capital assets not yet placed into service are capitalized as construction-in-progress and depreciated in accordance with the above guidelines once placed into service. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in loss from operations. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets. Long-lived assets to be held and used are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that the Company considers in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. If an impairment review is performed to evaluate a long-lived asset group for recoverability, the Company compares forecasts of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the long-lived asset group to its carrying value. An impairment loss would be recognized in loss from operations when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset group are less than its carrying amount. The impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset group over its fair value.

Fair Value Measurements

Certain assets and liabilities are carried at fair value under GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable:

•
Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
•
Level 2—Observable inputs (other than Level 1 quoted prices), such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
•
Level 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to determining the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques. 
The Company’s cash equivalents and marketable securities are carried at fair value, determined according to the fair value hierarchy described above (see Note 3). The carrying values of the Company’s accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these liabilities.

Leases
The Company accounts for a contract as a lease when it has the right to control the asset for a period of time while obtaining substantially all of the assets’ economic benefits. The Company determines the initial classification and measurement of its operating right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities at the lease commencement date, and thereafter if modified. The lease term includes any renewal options that the Company is reasonably assured to exercise. The Company’s policy is to not record leases with an original term of twelve months or less on its consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s only existing leases are for office and laboratory space.
The right-of-use asset represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. The lease liability represents the present value of the lease payments under the lease. The present value of lease payments is determined by using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily determinable; otherwise, the Company uses its estimated secured incremental borrowing rate for that lease term.
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability consist of the following: the fixed noncancelable lease payments, payments for optional renewal periods where it is reasonably certain the renewal period will be exercised, and payments for early termination options unless it is reasonably certain the lease will not be terminated early.

94

Leases may contain rent escalation clauses and variable lease payments that require additional rental payments in later years of the term, including payments based on an index or inflation rate. Payments based on the change in an index or inflation rate, or payments based on a change in the Company’s portion of the operating expenses, including real estate taxes and insurance, are not included in the initial lease liability and are recorded as a period expense when incurred. The operating leases may include an option to renew the lease term for various renewal periods and/or to terminate the leases early. These options to exercise the renewal or early termination clauses in the Company’s operating leases were not reasonably certain of exercise as of the date of adoption and these have not been included in the determination of the initial lease liability or operating lease expense.
Rent expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the reasonably assured lease term based on the total lease payments and is included in operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For finance leases, any interest expense is recognized using the effective interest method and is included within interest expense. The Company has no financing leases.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities, including salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits, facilities costs and laboratory supplies, depreciation, manufacturing expenses and external costs of outside vendors engaged to conduct preclinical development activities and clinical trials as well as the cost of licensing technology.

The Company has entered into various research and development contracts with companies both inside and outside of the United States. These agreements are generally cancelable, and related payments are recorded as research and development expenses as incurred. The Company records accruals for estimated ongoing external research and development costs. When billing terms under these contracts do not coincide with the timing of when the work is performed, the Company is required to make estimates of outstanding liabilities to those third parties as of the end of the reporting period. When evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities, the Company analyzes progress of the studies or trials, including the phase or completion of events, communication from the contract research organizations or other companies of any actual costs incurred during the period that have not yet been invoiced, invoices received and contracted costs. Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period. Actual results could differ from the Company’s estimates.
Upfront payments and milestone payments made for the licensing of technology are expensed as research and development in the period in which they are incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are recorded as prepaid expenses. The prepaid amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.

Patent Costs

All patent-related costs incurred in connection with filing and prosecuting patent applications are expensed as incurred due to the uncertainty about the recovery of the expenditure. Amounts incurred are classified as general and administrative expenses.

95

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company measures stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees, non-employees and directors based on their fair value on the date of the grant and recognizes compensation expense of those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. The Company applies the straight-line method of expense recognition to all awards with only service-based vesting conditions and applies the graded-vesting method to all awards with performance-based vesting conditions or to awards with both service-based and performance-based vesting conditions.

The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based options to employees and non-employees using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including (a) the expected volatility of its stock, (b) the expected term of the award, (c) the risk-free interest rate, and (d) expected dividends. Due to the lack of a sufficient history of public trading of the Company’s common stock and a lack of sufficient company-specific historical and implied volatility data, the Company has based the estimate of expected volatility on the historical volatility of a group of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries in a similar stage of development and that are publicly traded. The Company will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of its own stock price becomes available. The Company estimates the expected life of employee stock options using the “simplified” method, whereby, the expected life equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected life of the option are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted. The expected dividend yield of 
zero
 is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.
The Company measures the fair value of stock-based awards with market-based vesting conditions on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation mode
l.

For performance-based stock awards, the Company begins to recognize expense when it determines that the achievement of such performance conditions is deemed probable. This determination requires significant judgment by management. At the date achievement becomes probable, the Company records a cumulative expense catch-up, with remaining expense amortized over the remaining service period. For awards with market conditions, the stock-based compensation expense will be recognized over the derived service period regardless of whether the award achieves the market condition and will only be adjusted to the extent the service condition is not met
.
Comprehensive Loss

Comprehensive loss includes net loss as well as other changes in stockholders’ equity that result from transactions and economic events other than those with stockholders. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, the Company’s only element of other comprehensive loss was unrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities.
Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or in the Company’s tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent it believes, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to income tax expense. Potential for recovery of deferred tax assets is evaluated by estimating the future taxable profits expected and considering prudent and feasible tax planning strategies.

96

The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements by applying a two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Money market funds were valued using quoted prices in active markets, which represent a Level 1 measurement in the fair value hierarchy. U.S. Treasury bills and notes were valued by the Company using quoted prices in active markets for similar securities, which represent a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.
On July 6, 2020, the Company issued a non-transferrable contingent value right (“CVR”), which was distributed to stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 6, 2020, and prior to the issuance of any shares to acquire Kiq Bio LLC (“Kiq”) (the “Kiq Acquisition”) or sold to the Private Investment in Public Equity (“PIPE”) investors. In November 2020, the Company issued 
707,938
 shares of common stock in partial settlement of the CVR liability. In February 2021, the Company issued an additional 
212,429
 shares of common stock and paid $
0.1
 million in partial settlement of the CVR liability. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company updated the probability weighted discounted cash flow assumptions to reflect the then current probability of receiving the milestone payments from Sotio prior to the expiration of the CVR and the Company recorded a decrease in the CVR liability of $
1.4
 million as a component of other income (expense). The Company recorded an additional decrease in fair value of the liability of $
1.7
 million in the first quarter of 2023, reducing the liability to 
zero
 as the probability of additional CVR payments occurring prior to the expiration of CVR term was remote. The CVRs expired on 
August 6, 2023
 and no further payments will be made to CVR holders.

 PSUs under the 2018 Plan, which grants were subject to forfeiture in the event that the Company’s stockholders did not approve an in increase to the number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan (the “2023 Pool Increase”). On June 7, 2023, stockholders approved the 2023 Pool Increase and a grant date was established for accounting purposes for these PSUs in accordance with ASC 718 Compensation- Stock Compensation. An award holder can generally receive between 
0
% and 
200
% of the target award based on achievement of specified stock price hurdles and/or research and development milestones over a 
three-year
 performance period ending in February 2026. Any PSUs earned will vest, if at all, in a single tranche in February 2026 subject to a condition of continuing employment through the end of the performance period. During 2024, the Company granted an additional 
214,000
 PSUs to the Chief Commercial Officer upon his start date with the same terms and conditions as the awards granted in 2023. The fair value of the market-based awards was estimated on the date of grant for accounting purposes using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value of the performance-based awards was based on the closing share price of the Company’s common stock on the accounting grant date. As of 
December 31, 2024
, 
one
 of the research performance milestones, 
two
 of the development performance milestones were achieved and another 
one
 of the development performance milestones was determined to be probable of achievement.

As of December 31, 2024
, the Company had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $
268.1
 million and $
128.7
 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future taxable income and begin to expire in 
2035
. Of the federal net operating loss carryforwards at 
December 31, 2024
, $
264.8
 million is available to be carried forward indefinitely but can only offset 
80
% of taxable income per year. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company had U.S. federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of $
19.7
 million and $
4.4
 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and begin to expire in 
2040
 and 
2035
, respectively. The Company also had federal orphan drug tax credits of $
25.7
 million which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and begin to expire in 
2041
.
Utilization of the U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and corresponding provisions of state law, due to ownership changes that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes may limit the amount of carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period.

106

As a result of the shares issued in July 2020 related to the acquisition of Kiq and the sale of Series A convertible preferred stock, the Company experienced a change in ownership, as defined by Section 382. As a result of the ownership change, utilization of the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards is subject to annual limitation under Section 382. Under Section 382, the annual limitation is determined by first multiplying the value of the Company’s stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate, and then could be subject to additional adjustments, as required. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $
73.0
 million and $
1.5
 million of federal and state net operating losses, respectively, were subject to the July 2020 limitation of $
0.3
 million per year. A second ownership change occurred in December 2020 as a result of the underwritten public offering of common stock which resulted in a limitation of tax attributes generated from July 2020 to December 2020. The December 2020 ownership change is not expected to have a material impact to the Company’s net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards as these net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards may be utilized, subject to annual limitation, assuming sufficient taxable income is generated before expiration. The Company has not performed a Section 382 analysis since December 2020.

The Company has not performed a research and development tax credit study. Any change to the Company’s credits as a result of a study would be offset by a change in the valuation allowance.

The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon its ability to realize its net deferred tax assets. Management has considered the Company’s history of cumulative net losses incurred since inception and its lack of commercialization of any products or generation of any revenue from product sales since inception and has concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of its net deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been established against the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. Management reevaluates the positive and negative evidence at each reporting period.

The changes in the valuation allowance during the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards, tax credits generated and capitalized research and development expenses. Changes were as follows (in thousands):

, the Company had 
no
t recorded any amounts for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company files tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by federal and state jurisdictions, where applicable. The statute of limitations for assessment by the Internal Revenue Service remains open for all years from 2021 to the present, with certain states open from 2020 to the present. The Company’s tax attributes related to years prior to 2021 can still be adjusted under audit. The Company is currently under audit in Massachusetts for the 2022 and 2023 tax years. The Company does not expect the audit to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

 million upon the satisfaction of certain regulatory milestones. During the second quarter of 2022, as a result of the progression of the PEAK study, the first clinical milestone was achieved, resulting in payment of $
2.5
 million to Plexxikon in June 2022. As of 
December 31, 2024
, 
no
 other milestone payments have been made or are considered probable of occurring, however, $
5.0
 million may become payable in the next twelve months as a result 
of future regulatory filings.
The Company is also required to pay Plexxikon tiered royalties ranging from a low-single digit percentage to a high-single digit percentage on annual net sales of products. These royalty obligations last on a product-by-product basis and country-by-country basis until the latest of (i) the date on which there is no valid claim of a licensed Plexxikon patent covering a subject product in such country or (ii) the 10th anniversary of the date of the first commercial sale of the product in such country. In addition, if the Company sublicenses the rights under the License Agreement, the Company is required to pay a certain percentage of the sublicense revenue to Plexxikon ranging from mid-double digit percentages to mid-single digit percentages, depending on whether the sublicense is entered into prior to or after certain clinical trial events.
The license agreement will expire on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the later of the last to expire of the patents covering such licensed products or services or the 10-year anniversary of the date of first commercial sale of the licensed product in such country. The Company may terminate the license agreement within 30 days after written notice in the event of a material breach. The Company may also terminate the agreement upon written notice in the event of the Company’s bankruptcy, liquidation or insolvency. In addition, the Company has the right to terminate this agreement in its entirety at will upon 90 days’ advance written notice to Plexxikon.

109

Indemnification Agreements

In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to vendors, lessors, business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters including, but not limited to, losses arising out of breach of such agreements or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with members of its board of directors and its executive officers that will require the Company, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is, in many cases, unlimited. To date, the Company has not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications. The Company is not aware of any claims under indemnification arrangements that will have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and it has not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in its consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.
Legal Proceedings

The Company is not currently party to any material legal proceedings. At each reporting date, the Company evaluates whether or not a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable under the provisions of the authoritative guidance that addresses accounting for contingencies. The Company expenses as incurred the costs related to such legal proceedings.

10. Net Loss per Share

The Company computes net loss per share of common stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock using the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock and other participating securities. The two-class method is an earnings (loss) allocation method that requires income (loss) available to common stockholders be allocated to all such classes of common stock and other participating securities in accordance with the contractual terms of each class of stock. The Company has determined that the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock represent other classes of common stock for purposes of calculating net loss per share.
Basic and diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares and pre-funded warrants outstanding during the period, without consideration of potential dilutive securities. The pre-funded warrants are included in the computation of basic net loss per common share as the exercise price is negligible and they are fully vested and exercisable. For periods in which the Company generated a net loss, the Company does not include potential shares of common stock in diluted net loss per share when the impact of these items is anti-dilutive. The Company has generated a net loss for all periods presented, therefore diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share since the inclusion of potential shares of common stock would be anti-dilutive.
In accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share, the outstanding pre-funded warrants are included in the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share because the exercise price is negligible ($
0.01
 per share) and they are fully vested and exercisable at any time after the original issuance date.
Revision to previously issued financial statements
The Company previously concluded that Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock had preferences over the Company’s common stock and were therefore excluded from the calculation of basic and dilutive net loss per share pursuant to the two-class method. In preparing the Company’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company has now determined that the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock do not have preferential rights over the Company’s common stock and, accordingly, the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred stock should be considered additional classes of common stock for purposes of calculating net loss per share, utilizing the two-class method in accordance with ASC 260 Earnings Per Share. As a result of the correction, the Company has now allocated net loss to all classes of common stock and calculated basic and diluted net loss per share for common stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. Basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 as previously presented was $
2.42
 and $
2.39
, respectively, and as revised is $
1.94
 and $
1.73
, respectively. Net loss per share attributable to holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock was not previously presented.

110

The Company assessed the materiality of the change in the calculation of loss per share resulting from its conclusion that Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock are additional classes of common stock, considering both quantitative and qualitative factors, and concluded that the effects of the change to the calculation and presentation of net loss per share was not material, individually or in the aggregate, to any previously reported quarterly or annual period. However, the Company has revised its previously issued consolidated financial statements to reflect the change in presentation of net loss per share for all classes of stock, including common stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. All related amounts have been updated to reflect the effects of the revision throughout the financial statements and related footnotes, as applicable.
The following tables set forth the revised computation of basic and diluted net loss per share of Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock

The Company’s potential dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as the effect would be anti-dilutive and would result in a reduction to net loss per share. The Company excluded the following potential common shares, presented based on amounts outstanding at each period end, from the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for the periods indicated above because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect:

ITEM 9.	CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOU

None.

ITEM 9A.	CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and President and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d‑15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, it used the criteria established in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on such assessment, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
