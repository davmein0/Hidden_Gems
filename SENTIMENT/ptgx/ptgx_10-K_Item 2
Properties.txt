Properties 
We lease approximately 75,600 square feet of office and laboratory space in Newark, California under a lease agreement, as amended, that expires in November 2029. We believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet our current business needs. We anticipate that additional space will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if required.
