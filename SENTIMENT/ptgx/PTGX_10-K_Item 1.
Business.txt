OVERVIEW  
We are a discovery through late-stage development biopharmaceutical company focused on peptide therapeutics. Our clinical programs fall into two broad categories of diseases: (i) hematology and blood disorders, and (ii) inflammatory and immunomodulatory (“I&I”) diseases. Two novel peptides derived from our proprietary discovery technology platform, rusfertide and icotrokinra (formerly known as JNJ-2113), are currently in advanced Phase 3 clinical development, with New Drug Application (“NDA”) submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) potentially in 2025. 
Rusfertide, an injectable mimetic of the natural hormone hepcidin, is currently in Phase 3 development for treatment of the rare blood disorder polycythemia vera (“PV”). Rusfertide is being co-developed and will be co-commercialized with Takeda Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Takeda”) and the Company remains primarily responsible for development through NDA filing. Icotrokinra is a first-in-class investigational targeted oral peptide that selectively blocks the Interleukin-23 receptor (“IL-23R”) and is licensed to J&J Innovative Medicines (“JNJ”), formerly Janssen Biotech, Inc. Following icotrokinra’s joint discovery by us and JNJ scientists pursuant to our IL-23R collaboration, we were primarily responsible for the development of icotrokinra through Phase 1, with JNJ assuming responsibility for development in Phase 2 and beyond.
We also have a number of pre-clinical stage oral drug discovery programs to address clinically and commercially validated targets, including IL-17 oral peptide antagonist PN-881, an oral metabolic/obesity peptide program, and an oral hepcidin mimetic/ferroportin blocker program.
2024 Key Highlights
Worldwide License and Collaboration Agreement for Rusfertide with Takeda 
●
On January 31, 2024, we and Takeda announced a worldwide license and collaboration agreement for rusfertide. We received an upfront cash payment of $300.0 million in April 2024, and we are eligible to receive up to $330.0 million in development, regulatory, and sales milestones, for a potential deal value of up to $630.0 million, as well as an equal share of profits and losses in the U.S. and royalties on net sales outside the U.S.

Positive Phase 3 topline results from Phase 3 ICONIC studies of icotrokinra in plaque psoriasis
●
On November 18, 2024, we announced that in the ICONIC-LEAD study, once-daily icotrokinra showed significant skin clearance versus placebo in adults and adolescents with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. At week 16, nearly two-thirds (64.7%) of patients treated with icotrokinra achieved Investigator’s Global Assessment (“IGA”) scores of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear skin), and 49.6% achieved PASI 90 (90% improvement in skin lesions as measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (“PASI”)), compared to 8.3% and 4.4% on placebo, respectively. 
●
Further increases in response rates continued to be observed at week 24, with 74.1% of patients treated with icotrokinra achieving IGA scores of 0 or 1, and 64.9% achieving PASI 90. Safety data was found to be consistent with the Phase 2 FRONTIER 1 and 2 studies. A similar proportion of patients experienced adverse events between icotrokinra and placebo, with 49.3% and 49.1% of participants, respectively, experiencing a treatment-emergent adverse event (“TEAE”) at week 16. 
●
In addition, positive topline results from the Phase 3 ICONIC-TOTAL study showed that once-daily icotrokinra met the primary endpoint of IGA of 0 or 1 at week 16 compared to placebo.

Nomination of PN-881, a potential best-in-class oral peptide IL-17 antagonist development candidate; additional discovery programs announced
●
On November 21, 2024, we announced the nomination of PN-881 following extensive preclinical studies, including oral stability, potency, tissue distribution, and pharmacokinetics measurements, and evaluation in immunologic pharmacodynamics and preclinical efficacy models. PN-881 showed in vitro blockade of IL-17 AA homodimer, FF homodimer and AF heterodimer. It showed approximately 100-fold greater potency than secukinumab, and similar potency to the most potent approved antibody drugs and nanobody therapeutics currently in development.
●
We expect to nominate an oral development candidate in the hepcidin mechanism-based hematology program in the fourth quarter of 2025, and an oral peptide-based development candidate in the metabolic/obesity program in the second quarter of 2025.
Achievement of an amended $165.0 million milestone 
●
Under the terms of the icotrokinra license and collaboration agreement with J&J, as amended in November 2024, we earned $165.0 million in milestone payments during the fourth quarter of 2024. 
●
The $165.0 million payment was received in January 2025, and we remain eligible for up to $630.0 million in future development and sales milestone payments, and tiered royalties of 6-10% on worldwide net sales. The 10% royalty tier applies to net worldwide sales of $4 billion or more.
Significantly enhanced cash resources 
We ended fiscal 2024 with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $559.2 million, a significant increase from cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $341.6 million as of December 31, 2023.

Rusfertide
Rusfertide is currently in Phase 3 development for the treatment of PV. VERIFY (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT05210790) is a global double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of rusfertide in PV for approximately 250 patients. The trial evaluates the efficacy, symptom burden and safety of once-weekly, subcutaneously self-administered rusfertide in patients with uncontrolled hematocrit who are phlebotomy dependent despite standard of care treatment. The trial enrolled patients across North and South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. We expect to announce top-line data for the trial’s 32-week primary efficacy endpoint in March 2025, potentially leading to an NDA filing in the fourth quarter of 2025. 
Our rusfertide Phase 2 clinical trials include the following:
●
REVIVE (NCT04057040) – A Phase 2 proof of concept (“POC”) trial, was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2019. We completed enrollment of patients in the first quarter of 2022 and 70 patients were enrolled through the end of the randomized withdrawal portion of the trial, which was completed during the first quarter of 2023 and is continuing in an ongoing open-label extension (“OLE”); 
●
THRIVE (NCT06033586) – A Phase 2 long-term OLE for REVIVE patients on years three through five of treatment; and
●
PACIFIC (NCT04767802) – Another Phase 2 trial for rusfertide for patients diagnosed with PV and with routinely elevated hematocrit levels (>48%), was initiated during the first quarter of 2021, and the 52-week trial was completed during the second quarter of 2023.
Final results from the REVIVE trial presented at the American Society of Hematology (“ASH”) 2024 Annual Meeting in December 2024 showed that 54% of patients with PV experienced more than 2.5 years of durable hematocrit control (<45%), decreased phlebotomy use, long-term tolerability and improvements in patient-reported outcomes.
In January 2024, we entered into 
a worldwide license and collaboration agreement for rusfertide with 
Takeda (the “Takeda Collaboration Agreement”). We are primarily responsible for the development of rusfertide through a potential

NDA filing. Under the terms of the agreement, we received a one-time, non-refundable upfront payment of $300.0 million in April 2024, and we are eligible to receive additional worldwide development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments for rusfertide of up to $330.0 million, inclusive of the following potential upcoming milestones: 
●
$25.0 million upon successful achievement of the primary endpoint in the Phase 3 VERIFY trial for rusfertide in PV; and
●
$50.0 million upon FDA approval of an NDA for rusfertide in PV (or $75.0 million if we exercise our full right to opt-out of the 50:50 U.S. profit and loss sharing arrangement).
We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties from 10% to 17% on ex-U.S. net sales of rusfertide and other specified second-generation injectable hepcidin memetic compounds (the “Licensed Products”). We and Takeda will also share equally in profits and losses (50% to us and 50% to Takeda) of the Licensed Products in the United States, if approved. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details related to the agreement, including our right to opt-out of the 50:50 U.S. profit and loss sharing arrangement. 
Icotrokinra
Our IL-23R antagonist compound icotrokinra, licensed to J&J, is an orally delivered drug that is designed to block biological pathways currently targeted by marketed injectable antibody drugs. Our orally stable peptide approach may offer a targeted therapeutic approach for gastrointestinal and systemic compartments as needed. We believe that, compared to antibody drugs, icotrokinra has the potential to provide clinical improvement in an oral medication with increased convenience and compliance and the opportunity for the earlier introduction of targeted oral therapy.
JNJ has initiated the following icotrokinra trials:
●
ICONIC-LEAD (NCT06095115) – A 684-patient randomized, controlled Phase 3 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of icotrokinra compared with placebo in participants with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, with PASI-90 and IGA scores of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) as co-primary endpoints;
●
ICONIC-TOTAL (NCT06095102) – A 311-patient randomized, controlled Phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of icotrokinra compared with placebo for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in participants with at least moderate severity affecting special areas (scalp, genital, and/or palms of the hands and soles of the feet) with overall IGA scores of 0 or 1 as the primary endpoint; 
●
ICONIC-ADVANCE 1 (NCT06143878) – A 774-patient randomized, controlled Phase 3 trial to evaluate the effectiveness of icotrokinra in participants with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis compared to placebo and Sotyktu® (“deucravacitinib”). The trial’s primary co-endpoints are PASI-90 and IGA scores of 0 or 1;  
●
ICONIC-ADVANCE 2 (NCT06220604) – A 731-patient Phase 3 trial similarly designed to ICONIC ADVANCE 1 in participants with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis;
●
Pustular/Erythrodermic Psoriasis (NCT06295692) – A 19-patient open label Phase 3 trial to evaluate the effectiveness of icotrokinra in participants with pustular or erythrodermic psoriasis;
●
ICONIC-PsA 2 (NCT06807424) – A 750-patient randomized, controlled Phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of icotrokinra compared with placebo in biologic-experienced patients with active  psoriatic arthritis (“PsA”); and
●
ANTHEM-UC (NCT06049017) – A 252-patient randomized, controlled Phase 2b trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of icotrokinra compared with placebo in participants with moderate-to-severely active ulcerative colitis (“UC”).
In the fourth quarter of 2024, we announced positive topline results for the ICONIC-LEAD and ICONIC-TOTAL Phase 3 trials. In the ICONIC-LEAD trial, once daily icotrokinra showed significant skin clearance versus placebo in adults and adolescents with moderate to-severe plaque psoriasis. At week 16, nearly two-thirds (64.7%) of patients

Table of Contents
treated with icotrokinra achieved IGA scores of 0 or 1 and 49.6% achieved PASI-90, compared to 8.3% and 4.4% on placebo, respectively. In addition, topline results from the Phase 3 ICONIC-TOTAL trial showed that once daily icotrokinra met the primary endpoint of IGA scores of 0 or 1 at week 16 as compared to placebo. Comprehensive results from both ICONIC-LEAD and ICONIC-TOTAL are expected to be presented at upcoming medical congresses and shared with health authorities in planned submissions.
Topline results for the ANTHEM trial are expected in the first quarter of 2025. Topline results for the ICONIC-ADVANCE 1, ICONIC-ADVANCE 2, and pustular/erythrodermic psoriasis trials are expected in the second quarter of 2025. 
On July 27, 2021, we entered into an Amended and Restated License and Collaboration Agreement with JNJ, which amended and restated the License and Collaboration Agreement, effective July 13, 2017, by and between the Company and JNJ, as amended by the first amendment, effective May 7, 2019 (together, the “JNJ License and Collaboration Agreement”) for the development and commercialization of icotrokinra. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we earned a $50.0 million milestone payment in connection with the dosing of the third patient in the ICONIC-TOTAL Phase 3 clinical trial of icotrokinra in patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and a $10.0 million milestone payment upon the dosing of the third patient in the ANTHEM Phase 2b trial in patients with moderately-to-severely active UC. The JNJ License and Collaboration Agreement was further amended in November 2024 to:
●
increase the milestone payment for a Phase 3 clinical trial of any licensed product for any indication meeting its primary endpoint by $50.0 million, from $115.0 million to $165.0 million;
●
eliminate the $35.0 million milestone payment previously due for the acceptance of an NDA filing by the FDA for a licensed product for any indication; and 
●
eliminate the $15.0 million milestone payment previously due for the dosing of the third patient in the first Phase 3 clinical trial of a licensed product for a second indication.
We earned the $165.0 million milestone payment described above during the fourth quarter of 2024. We have earned a total of $337.5 million in nonrefundable payments from JNJ from 2017 through December 31, 2024. We are eligible to receive up to $630.0 million in future development and sales milestone payments, inclusive of the following potential upcoming milestones:
●
$50.0 million milestone upon approval of an NDA for icotrokinra in any indication;
●
$25.0 million milestone upon the acceptance of an NDA filing by the FDA for icotrokinra in a second indication; and
●
$45.0 million milestone upon the approval of an NDA for icotrokinra in a second indication.
We also remain eligible to receive upward tiering royalties on net product sales at percentages ranging from 6% percent to 10% percent, with 10% percent applicable for net sales over $4.0 billion. 
See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
PN-881
In the fourth quarter of 2024, we announced the selection of PN-881, a potential best-in-class oral peptide IL-17 antagonist, as a development candidate for the treatment of immune-mediated skin diseases. PN-881 targets three IL-17 dimers (IL-17 AA, AF and FF), which may offer potential treatment options for h
idradenitis suppurativa (“HS”), spondyloarthritis, plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (“PsA”). Investigational New Drug (“IND”), or foreign equivalent, enabling studies are ongoing, and we expect to initiate a PN-881 Phase 1 study in the fourth quarter of 2025.
Discovery Platform 
Our clinical and pre-clinical assets are all derived from our proprietary discovery platform. Our platform enables us to engineer novel, structurally constrained peptides that are designed to retain key advantages of both orally delivered small molecules and injectable antibody drugs while overcoming many of their limitations as therapeutic agents.

Table of Contents
Importantly, constrained peptides can be designed to potentially alleviate the fundamental instability inherent in traditional peptides to allow different delivery forms, such as oral, subcutaneous, intravenous, and rectal. Our discovery pipeline has strategically focused on (i) hematology and blood disorders, (ii) I&I diseases and (iii) metabolic diseases, including obesity.
We have a pre-clinical stage program to identify an orally administered hepcidin mimetic/ferroportin blocker, which we believe to be complementary to the injectable rusfertide for offering the best treatment options for PV and other potential erythropoietic and iron imbalance disorders, and we expect to nominate a development candidate in the fourth quarter of 2025. We also have an oral peptide-based metabolic/obesity program and expect to nominate a development candidate in the second quarter of 2025.
RUSFERTIDE: AN INJECTABLE HEPCIDIN MIMETIC   
Rusfertide, an injectable hepcidin mimetic, was discovered through our peptide technology platform. Hepcidin is a natural hormone that regulates iron metabolism. We are developing rusfertide for the treatment of PV.
Polycythemia Vera 
PV is a rare myeloproliferative neoplasm that is typically associated with a Janus Kinase (“JAK”) 2 mutation. PV is primarily characterized by the overproduction of red blood cells (“RBCs”), which contributes to an elevated risk of cardiovascular and thrombotic events, such as heart attack and stroke. PV is also associated with a risk of disease progression to myelofibrosis or leukemia. According to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (“NCCN”) guidelines, age and thrombosis history determine a patient’s risk classification as either low-risk or high-risk. Regardless of risk, treatment guidelines for PV consistently emphasize the importance of controlling the patient’s hematocrit (RBCs as a percentage of whole blood) below 45% to reduce thrombotic risk.
Early-stage patients are typically treated with low dose aspirin and therapeutic phlebotomy. Hydroxyurea may also be used alone or in combination with phlebotomy. At later stages, patients may receive interferons, marketed as Besremi® or Pegasys®, or ruxolitinib, a JAK inhibitor marketed as Jakafi®. Cytoreductive therapies such as hydroxyurea, interferons and ruxolitinib impact all cell lines and can have challenging side effect profiles associated with their cytoreductive mechanisms. We believe there are substantial PV patient groups that could benefit from a new non-cytoreductive therapeutic option which specifically targets RBCs.

Although NCCN guidelines state that hematocrit levels should be maintained below 45% to reduce thrombotic risk, analysis of a large medical claims database indicated that 78% of treated PV patients did not maintain hematocrit control below 45%. These findings showed that current therapies do not offer adequate hematocrit control, highlighting a significant unmet need in the United States alone where patients may have an elevated risk of cardiovascular and thrombotic events.
There are approximately 155,000 diagnosed (approximately 78,000 treated) patients living in the United States, with a similar number in Europe, representing an estimated market opportunity of approximately $1.0 billion to $2.0 billion. Patients are typically diagnosed between the ages of 50 and 70, and median survival is approximately 14 years. Approximately 55% of treated PV patients receive frequent phlebotomy and high doses of hydroxyurea, which can cause undue burden to the patient. Additionally, approximately 16% of patients experience a thrombotic event while receiving treatment(s) for PV. We believe rusfertide can potentially benefit a broad spectrum of patients across the continuum of care, either as monotherapy or in combination with other cytoreductive therapies.
We believe that rusfertide has the potential to provide a substantial benefit to patients by offering a treatment focused on managing hematocrit in a consistent and predictable manner, dramatically decreasing the need for phlebotomy. Rusfertide is a non-cytoreductive mimetic of the natural hormone hepcidin, the master regulator of iron homeostasis in the body. Since high RBC production consumes iron stores, PV can cause iron deficiency, which is often exacerbated by phlebotomy. Rusfertide has a unique iron regulatory mechanism, which data from our Phase 2 REVIVE trial suggests allows for persistent control of hematocrit without causing iron deficiency. Rusfertide acts by redistributing iron away from the bone marrow, where iron is essential for RBC production, thereby limiting excess RBC production while still providing sufficient iron levels to support other normal cellular and organ functions.

Cancers are common in PV patients. A retrospective analysis presented at the ASH 2023 Annual Meeting in December 2023 on the incidence of cancers in PV patients not treated with rusfertide demonstrated the heightened underlying cancer risk in this population, particularly among those treated with hydroxyurea. Additionally, the majority of patients with prior TEAEs, who are at highest risk of developing a TEAE, did not experience recurrent TEAEs while on rusfertide. The mechanisms contributing to the increased risk of cancers in PV patients are not well understood. However, the subset of PV patients treated with hydroxyurea in this study of real-world claims data had nearly twice the rate of cancers compared to phlebotomy-only treated patients.
Clinical Development of Rusfertide in PV
In the fourth quarter of 2019, we initiated REVIVE, a Phase 2 trial of rusfertide in PV designed to evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy in patients requiring phlebotomy (“PHL”). The REVIVE trial was expected to enroll approximately 60 patients and consisted of a 16-week open-label dose finding stage every 4 weeks from 10 mg to 80 mg and a 12-week maintenance period at doses which generate desired hematocrit levels, followed by a 12-week randomized and blinded withdrawal stage. The endpoints of this clinical POC trial include measurement of blood parameters (hematocrit and hemoglobin levels), reductions or delay in phlebotomy requirements, and improvements in quality-of-life symptoms. We initiated THRIVE, a Phase 2 long-term extension trial, to monitor long-term safety and benefits of rusfertide for REVIVE patients on years three through five of treatment.
Figure 2. REVIVE and THRIVE: Rusfertide Phase 2 PV Trial Design
Preliminary results showed that the vast majority of patients treated with rusfertide in the REVIVE clinical trial were able to eliminate therapeutic phlebotomies and maintain a target hematocrit level of less than 45 percent. Treatment with rusfertide was also shown to reverse iron deficiency, an important side effect of regular therapeutic phlebotomies as a treatment for PV. Preliminary results indicated that rusfertide therapy resulted in rapid, sustained and durable hematocrit control without clinically meaningful changes in white blood cell and platelet counts. Rusfertide demonstrated similar efficacy in all categories of patients, independent of the PV patient risk category or concurrent therapy with hydroxyurea, interferon or ruxolitinib. 
In March 2023, we announced positive topline results from the blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal portion of the REVIVE trial. Subjects receiving rusfertide achieved statistically significant improvements versus placebo in the trial’s primary endpoint. The double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week randomized withdrawal portion was included as Part 2 of the REVIVE trial to evaluate rusfertide in PV patients with frequent phlebotomy requirements. In the REVIVE trial, subjects were initially enrolled in the 28-week open label dose-titration and efficacy evaluation Part 1 of the trial, followed by 1:1 randomization of 53 subjects to placebo versus rusfertide therapy for a subsequent duration of 12 weeks. More subjects receiving rusfertide during the blinded randomized withdrawal portion

Table of Contents
of the REVIVE trial were responders compared with placebo (69.2% versus 18.5%, p=0.0003). A trial subject was defined as a responder if the subject completed 12 weeks of double-blind treatment while maintaining hematocrit control without phlebotomy eligibility and without phlebotomy. During the 12 weeks of the blinded, randomized withdrawal, 92.3% of subjects on rusfertide (24 out of 26) were not phlebotomized.
In addition, in subjects with moderate or severe Myeloproliferative Neoplasm-Symptom Assessment Form (“MPN-SAF”) symptom scores at baseline, the change from baseline was statistically significant in fatigue, problems with concentration, inactivity and itching during the 28-week open label Part 1 of the trial. Meaningful comparison of symptoms assessments in Part 2 are not possible since a majority of subjects randomized to placebo discontinued prior to the 12-week assessment of MPN-SAF symptoms.
Rusfertide continued to be generally well tolerated in the REVIVE trial, with localized ISRs comprising the majority of reported adverse events. No new safety signals were observed in safety data disclosed in connection with the Part 2 efficacy results, relative to the safety data from the REVIVE trial presented at the December 2022 ASH Annual Meeting, which indicated that 84% of TEAEs were Grade 2 or below. 16% of patients experienced Grade 3 TEAEs and there were no Grade 4 TEAEs. 
In December 2023, we presented two-year follow up data from patients in the Phase 2 REVIVE trial who continued into the OLE at the ASH 2023 Annual Meeting. The Phase 2 trial consisted of three parts including 70 patients in the dose-finding Part 1 (28 weeks), 59 patients in the placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal Part 2 (13 weeks), and 58 patients in the OLE (52 weeks). At the end of Part 2, 69% (18/26) of rusfertide patients achieved hematocrit control and remained phlebotomy free at 12 weeks, compared to only 19% (5 out of 27) on placebo (p=0.0003). Among the 58 patients that continued into the OLE, as of October 17, 2023 (data cut-off date for the ASH presentation), 57 had been treated for over one year and 37 had been treated for over two years. The median follow-up was 2.1 years and data were provided out to 2.5 years in 21 patients.
Results showed that rusfertide, when used in patients previously treated with phlebotomy with or without cytoreductive therapy through two years, resulted in durable hematocrit control, decreased phlebotomy use, long-term tolerability, and no new safety signals in patients with PV. An analysis of the PACIFIC Phase 2 trial was also presented which showed that rusfertide improved markers of iron deficiency in patients with PV. In addition, data was presented regarding the prevalence of thromboembolic events and secondary cancers in PV patients not treated with rusfertide.
In February 2024, the full Phase 2 REVIVE trial results, including efficacy and safety data, were published in the NEJM. Updated long-term results from the REVIVE trial presented at the European Hematology Association Congress in June 2024 continued to show a durable positive effect on PV symptomology and other benefits, including iron deficiency as well as an encouraging safety profile.

Figure 3. REVIVE: Clinical Efficacy of Rusfertide in REVIVE Trial 
Data as of October 18, 2024
In November 2024, final data from the REVIVE trial was presented at the ASH 2024 Annual Meeting (Figure 3). 
As of October 18, 2024 (the data cut-off date for presentation at ASH), 50 (71%), 38 (54%), and 17 (24%) patients received rusfertide for ≥2, ≥2.5, or ≥3 years, respectively. Of the 58 patients who entered the REVIVE Part 3 OLE, the median duration of therapy was 131.4 weeks (2.5 years). As of October 18, 2024, 46, or over 80%, of patients have rolled over to the THRIVE trial and are eligible to receive up to two additional years of rusfertide treatment. Trial results showed that rusfertide, when added to therapeutic phlebotomy with or without cytoreductive therapy, achieved long term durable control of hematocrit below the 45% threshold for over three years.
Prior to enrollment, the estimated mean phlebotomy rate (“EPHL”) in patients who enrolled in the trial was >5 per year. In Part 1, the EPHL was <1 per year in patients who received rusfertide (N=70). In Part 2 (randomized withdrawal phase), the EPHL was <1 per year and approximately 6.1 per year in the rusfertide and placebo groups, respectively. For patients who continued to Part 3 (Week 42+), the EPHL remained at <1 per year. Patients showed increased mean corpuscular volume and continued improvement and normalization of serum ferritin levels. Platelet levels increased following initiation of rusfertide therapy and stabilized over time and mean leukocyte counts remained stable throughout the trial.
The MPN-SAF was used to assess mean change from baseline in the individual symptom score in patients with moderate (score of 4-6 out of 10) or severe (score of 7-10 out of 10) symptoms at baseline. In patients who had moderate or severe symptoms at baseline (score of ≥4 out of 10), there were significant improvements from baseline in fatigue, early satiety, abdominal discomfort, inactivity, problems with concentration, night sweats, and itching at the end of Part 3.
Overall, 18 (26%) patients experienced serious adverse events (“SAEs”); most SAEs were unrelated and likely associated with the underlying disease. One patient developed acute myeloid leukemia after treatment discontinuation. After more than 150 patient-years of rusfertide exposure, malignancies were reported in 11 patients (nine patients had skin malignancies); all of these patients had prior risk factors that may have contributed to development of these malignancies. There was no obvious correlation between increased exposure to rusfertide and the malignancies reported. Seven thrombotic events (six arterial and one venous) occurred in six patients who all had high-risk PV. No thrombotic events have been reported in patients with low-risk PV as of October 18, 2024.

These results indicate that rusfertide continued to demonstrate a positive clinical impact in the treatment of PV patients. With more than three years of data showing strong and continued improvements in hematocrit as well as encouraging evidence of symptoms improvement, we believe rusfertide continues to show its potential as a first-in-class erythrocytosis-focused treatment option for patients with PV. 
Figure 4. VERIFY: Rusfertide Phase 3 PV Trial Design
We initiated VERIFY, a global double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of rusfertide in PV for approximately 250 patients, in the first quarter of 2022 (Figure 4). We expect to announce top-line data for the trial’s 32-week primary efficacy endpoint in the first quarter of 2025, potentially leading to an NDA filing in the fourth quarter of 2025.
We currently have the following designations for rusfertide in PV:
●
The FDA granted orphan drug designation for rusfertide for the treatment of PV in June 2020;
●
The European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) granted orphan drug designation for rusfertide for the treatment of PV in October 2020; and
●
The FDA granted fast track designation for rusfertide for the treatment of PV in December 2020.
Rodent Carcinogenicity Studies
Rat carcinogenicity study.  
In the fourth quarter of 2024, we received the draft audited pathology report from our two-year study evaluating the carcinogenicity potential of rusfertide when administered once weekly. The draft report concluded that there were no carcinogenicity-related findings associated with rusfertide. We expect to receive the final audited report during the first quarter of 2025 which will then be submitted to the FDA.
​
RasH2 mouse carcinogenicity study
.  In 2021, we completed a 26-week rasH2 transgenic mouse carcinogenicity study related to rusfertide. In the rasH2 study, there were rusfertide related findings associated with benign squamous cell papilloma and malignant squamous cell carcinoma. Our rusfertide clinical trials were placed on a brief clinical hold from mid-September to early October 2021 following our receipt of the results of the RasH2 mouse study.

OVERVIEW OF DISEASES DRIVEN BY IL-23 AND IL-17 PATHWAYS
IL-23 is a member of the Interleukin 12 (“IL-12”) family of cytokines with pro-inflammatory and immune stimulatory properties. Cytokines are cell signaling proteins that are released by cells and affect the behavior of other cells. Binding of the IL-23 ligand to the IL-23R receptor leads to an expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the local tissue autocrine cascade that is an important pathway of many inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis, PsA and inflammatory bowel disease (“IBD”). The injectable antibody drug Stelara® (marketed for psoriasis, PsA, UC and CD) is a p40 antagonist antibody that inhibits both the IL-23 and IL-12 pathways. Next-generation antibody drugs, such as Tremfya® and Skyrizi®, target the p19 subunit of the IL-23 ligand and are specific inhibitors of the IL-23 pathway, which is believed to be the critical driver of local tissue pathology. Tremfya® is approved in psoriasis, PsA and UC and has completed successful Phase 3 clinical trials in CD. Skyrizi® is approved in psoriasis, PsA, UC and CD. The anti-IL-23 antibody Omvoh® (mirikizumab) has been approved in UC and CD, and the anti-IL-23 antibody Ilumya® trial (tildrakizumab) has been approved in psoriasis.
IL-23 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine with immune stimulatory properties. Binding of the IL-17 ligand to the IL-17R receptor leads to an expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the local tissue autocrine cascade that is an important pathway of many inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis, PsA, spondyloarthropathies, and HS). The injectable antibody drugs Cosentyx® and Taltz® (marketed for psoriasis, PsA, ankylosing spondylitis (“AS”) and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthropathies (“nr-axSpA”), with Cosentyx® also marketed for HS, and pediatric enthesitis-related arthritis) are IL-17A antagonist antibodies that inhibit the IL-17 pathway. The injectable antibody drug Bimzelx® blocks both IL-17A and IL-17F, thereby more completely blocking the IL-17 pathway by blocking its three dimeric forms – IL-17AA, -AF, and -FF. Bimzelx® is approved in psoriasis, PsA, AS, nr-axSpA, and HS. The injectable antibody Saliq® is an antibody that blocks the IL-17 receptor A, thereby blocking the IL-17 pathway, and is approved in psoriasis.
Psoriasis 
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin that affects 130 million people worldwide and over 8 million in the United States, translating to 2-3% of the adult population. Psoriasis is associated with several comorbid conditions including cardiovascular disease and obesity, and 30% of psoriasis patients develop arthritic complications. Psoriasis is also associated with significantly decreased quality of life for patients. 
Plaque p
soriasis is the most common form of psoriasis, which is recognized as the most prevalent immune-mediated inflammatory disease, involving skin and joints and associated with abnormalities of other systems. Several factors, such as surface area covered and symptom burden, impact whether one’s psoriasis is considered mild, moderate, or severe. Typically, 3-10% of affected body surface area is considered moderate psoriasis, and more than 10% is considered severe psoriasis. Global market sales for psoriasis therapies in 2023 were $24.9 billion, with U.S. market sales of $18.4 billion. The global market forecast for 2033 anticipates sales of $32.0 billion, with U.S. market sales of $23.8 billion. Identification of the IL-23/IL-17 axis as the key pathway driving psoriatic inflammation has led to the development of more effective and safer systemic therapies that inhibit IL-17 (e.g., Taltz®, Cosentyx®, Bimzelx®, Saliq®) and IL-23 (e.g., Tremfya®, Skyrizi®, Ilumya®). These biologics have revolutionized the treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis, with superior efficacy and safety compared to conventional oral therapies (e.g., methotrexate, cyclosporin), and first-generation biologics (e.g., anti-TNFs, Stelara®). The anti-IL-17 class is ineffective in IBD, surprisingly showing overall worsening of disease in Phase 2 trials, which is reflected in the product labels. There is still an unmet need for new therapies. Only 25% of biologic eligible moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients are treated with a biologic. The parenteral route of administration for these advanced biologics poses a patient level barrier to entry. Two

oral medicines have been approved in moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Otezla® was approved in 2014. It is the least effective of all drugs approved since 2004 but is used widely because of a perceived positive safety profile. In 2022, the first TYK2 inhibitor, Sotyktu®, was approved. A second TYK2 inhibitor, TAK-279 is in Phase 3 trials for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. We believe there is still significant need for safe and effective oral therapies in moderate-to-severe psoriasis. 
Psoriatic Arthritis 
PsA is an inflammatory disease of the peripheral and axial joints that complicates psoriasis in up to 30% of patients. Among the over 8 million patients in the United States with psoriasis in 2024, it is estimated that approximately 1 million patients have PsA. Many patients with active PsA may have mild psoriasis and many patients with severe psoriasis may have only mild PsA symptoms. PsA is associated with several chronic conditions. PsA may present even before skin symptoms in 10% to 15% of patients. Cardiovascular comorbidities have a higher prevalence in PsA than psoriasis and can impact lifespan and quality of life. Several new targeted therapies have been approved for use in PsA, with additional therapies in development. These advances have improved outcomes, including reductions in musculoskeletal symptoms, skin manifestations and radiographic joint damage. Many of the same drugs approved in psoriasis are also approved in PsA. One notable exception is that the JAK inhibitors, Xeljanz® and Rinvoq®, are approved in PsA without the respective label in psoriasis.
Hidradenitis Suppurativa 
HS is a chronic, debilitating, inflammatory follicular skin disease with recurring painful flare-ups that affected approximately 2.9 million people in the U.S. and 6.3 million worldwide in 2024. HS can progress and worsen over time, with tunnels forming under the skin between abscesses, which can lead to scarring. HS symptoms typically affect intertriginous areas of the skin, such as the breasts, buttocks, groin, inner thighs, and under the arms. The suppuration is often accompanied by a foul smell, and the psychosocial burden, including isolation, can be severe. HS is associated with frequent, long-term sick leave, often having a substantial socio-economic impact. Global market sales for HS therapies in 2024 were $1.5 billion, with U.S. market sales of $1.2 billion. The global market forecast for 2034 anticipates sales of $6.5 billion, with U.S. market sales of $5.4 billion. 
Treatment for HS depends on the severity of the disease and traditionally included skin care, topical medications, antibiotics, acitretin, hormonal medications, and, in severe cases, surgical removal of the affected skin.  Several new targeted therapies have more recently been approved, including an injectable
 antibody drug Humira®, which binds to tumor necrosis factor alpha (“TNFα”), as well as the anti-IL-17 drugs Cosentyx® and Bimzelx®.  Though these advances have improved outcomes, there remains significant unmet need for new therapies. 
Axial Spondyloarthritis
Axial spondyloarthritis (“axSpA”) is a systemic disease leading to arthritis affecting the spine and the sacroiliac joint that affected approximately 2.9 million people in the U.S. and 4.7 million patients worldwide in 2024. AxSpA has a strong genetic predisposition most commonly associated with HLA-B27. Over time, the disease may progress from nr-axSpA, which is associated with damage that may not be visible in X-rays but may be seen on magnetic resonance images, to AS, also known as radiographic axSpA, with damage to the sacroiliac joints and spine visible on X-rays. Severe disease can lead to fusion of the vertebrae, a condition referred to as bamboo spine. Men are more likely to accrue radiographic joint damage, whereas women tend to experience comparatively worse quality of life and disease activity. The disease can occur at any age but typically begins between ages 20 and 40. AS is more common in men than in women. However, nr-axSpA may be just as common in women as in men. It is less common among African Americans than people of other racial backgrounds. Global market sales for axSpA therapies in 2024 were $7.5 million, with U.S. market sales of $6.0 million. The global market forecast for 2034 anticipates sales of $10.7 million, with U.S. market sales of $8.7 million. Therapeutic options for patients with axSpA have expanded significantly over the past two decades. Patients who have failed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have multiple therapeutic options, including TNFα inhibitors (Enbrel®, Humira®, Remicade®, Simponi®, Cimzia®), IL-17 (Cosentyx®, Taltz®, Bimzelx®) and JAK inhibitors (Xeljanz®, Rinvoq®).

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (“IBD”)
IBD is a group of chronic autoimmune and inflammatory conditions of the colon and small intestine, consisting primarily of UC and CD. In UC, inflammation may be limited to part of the colon or extend through its entirety. UC is primarily characterized by ulceration of the intestinal surface, accompanied by rectal bleeding and frequent, urgent bowel movements. CD occurs anywhere along the GI tract, commonly affecting the small intestine and the proximal large intestine. CD complications may include strictures and fistula, which penetrate all layers of the intestine. UC is usually diagnosed earlier than CD due to bleeding symptoms. Patients with CD may initially present with abdominal pain, fatigue and anorexia, which can be misdiagnosed. Both diseases’ peak diagnosis years are in young adulthood and are found about equally in both males and females. Management is lifelong and affects school attendance, graduation rates, childbearing and work productivity. IBD prevalence is increasing worldwide and is correlated with the adoption of western diets and lifestyle, as well as genetic factors (5-20% of affected patients have a first degree relative with the disease). 
According to the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation, IBD is diagnosed in over 0.7% of Americans, resulting in a population of approximately 2.4 million patients in the United States. In 2023, global sales for UC therapies were approximately $7.8 billion, and the market is expected to grow to $13.2 billion by 2030. In 2023, global sales for CD therapies were estimated to be $15.2 billion, with anticipated growth to $18.1 billion by 2030. 
For many years, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (“TNF-α”) antibody drugs were the primary treatment for moderate-to-severe IBD. Humira®

and Remicade® are injectable and infused, respectively. Approximately one third of IBD patients do not respond to TNF-α antibody drugs and approximately another 30% to 40% become refractory within the first year of treatment. Additionally, TNF-α antibody drugs may predispose patients to an increased risk of serious infection and the development of anti-drug antibodies, which over time can cause loss of drug response. More recently, antibody products focused on potentially safer mechanisms of action have been gaining market share. One such product is Takeda’s Entyvio®, which targets the α4β7 integrin pathway. Takeda reported 2023 sales of Entyvio® of approximately $5.2 billion. Similarly, Johnson & Johnson’s Stelara®, which targets the IL-12 and IL-23 pathways, has gained significant traction. Johnson & Johnson global sales of Stelara® (approved for psoriasis, PsA, moderate-to-severe CD and UC) were $10.4 billion in 2024. Three anti-IL-23 mAbs have been evaluated in IBD. Skyrizi® and Omvoh® are approved in UC and CD, and Tremfya® is approved in UC and recently completed successful Phase 3 clinical trials in CD. The pan-JAK inhibitor Xeljanz® is approved in UC and the more selective JAK1/3 inhibitor Rinvoq® was approved in 2022 for UC and CD. The S1P1 modulator class of oral small molecules has also demonstrated efficacy in IBD, with Zeposia® approved in UC (but not CD) in 2021, and etrasimod approved in UC in 2023. The S1P1 class is associated with immunosuppression, cardiac, pulmonary and ocular toxicities.
The development of new, potent and targeted orally delivered therapies for IBD may offer safer and more effective treatment options, alone or in combination, for moderate-to-severe IBD patients. In addition, many clinicians continue to advocate for earlier introduction of targeted therapeutics in mild-to-moderate IBD to prevent disease progression and irreversible gastrointestinal damage. Given that the most effective agents in IBD induce remission in no more than 30% of patients, there has been much recent interest in combination therapies to break through this “therapeutic ceiling.” In 2022, JNJ reported results of the VEGA study, the first randomized double bind clinical trial to assess the combination of an anti-TNF (Simponi®) with an anti-IL-23 (Tremfya®) in moderate-to-severe UC. In the Phase 2a POC trial, investigators found 83.1% of patients in the treatment group achieved a clinical response and 36.6% of patients treated with the combination therapy achieved clinical remission. The high rates of clinical response and remission are both higher than the response and remission rates of patients treated with guselkumab alone (74.6%; 21.1%) and golimumab alone (61.1%; 22.2%). Hence, we believe the IL-23 inhibition mechanism is a potentially paradigm shifting combination strategy to improve remission rates in UC. 
ICOTROKINRA: AN ORAL IL-23 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST 
JNJ License and Collaboration Agreement
We have a worldwide license and collaboration agreement with JNJ to research, develop and co-detail IL-23R antagonist compounds for all indications, including IBD. See Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis –

Overview” and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. JNJ is an experienced innovator in therapeutics targeting the IL-23 pathway. Stelara® is a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-12 and IL-23 through their common p40 subunit is approved in psoriasis, PsA, CD and UC. Stelara® generated $10.4 billion in sales in 2024. Tremfya® is a specific IL-23 monoclonal antibody. It is approved in psoriasis and PsA and has completed successful Phase 3 trials in UC and CD. Tremfya® generated $3.7 billion in sales in 2024. We believe that in both psoriasis and IBD, there is an urgent need for safe and effective oral therapies. It is notable that Stelara® lost patent exclusivity in 2023 with biosimilar competition expected. 
Icotrokinra, an orally delivered IL-23R specific antagonist for the potential treatment of psoriasis, PsA and IBD indications, was discovered through our peptide technology platform. IL-23, a member of the IL-12 family of pro-inflammatory cytokines, is a protein that regulates inflammatory and immune function and plays a key role in the development of IBD. By blocking IL-23R, we believe icotrokinra may improve disease symptoms while potentially minimizing the risk of systemic side effects. During the fourth quarter of 2021, a decision was made by JNJ to advance development of icotrokinra. For icotrokinra, JNJ is primarily responsible for the conduct of all further development, and we were primarily responsible for the discovery, IND-enabling studies and the initial Phase 1 study.
Clinical Development of Icotrokinra 
In February 2022, JNJ initiated FRONTIER 1, a 255-patient Phase 2b clinical trial of icotrokinra in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, which was completed in December 2022. FRONTIER 1 was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated three once-daily dosages and two twice-daily dosages of icotrokinra taken orally. The primary endpoint of the trial was the proportion of patients achieving PASI-75 at 16 weeks. In July 2023, we announced updated positive topline results from the trial, which were presented by JNJ at the World Congress of Dermatology in Singapore. Icotrokinra achieved the trial’s primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. A statistically significant greater proportion of patients who received icotrokinra achieved PASI-75 responses as well as PASI-90 and PASI-100 responses compared to placebo at week 16 in all five of the trial’s treatment groups. A clear dose response was observed across an eight-fold dose range. Treatment was well tolerated, with no meaningful difference in frequency of adverse events across treatment groups versus placebo. 
At JNJ’s Enterprise Business Review in December 2023, JNJ highlighted icotrokinra as a potential first- and best-in-class targeted oral IL-23 peptide antagonist with potential across multiple indications, including plaque psoriasis, PsA and inflammatory bowel disease, with potential peak year sales projected at greater than $5.0 billion. JNJ IL-23 monoclonal antibody drugs Stelara and Tremfya generated approximately $14.1 billion in revenues in 2024. 
In February 2024, the icotrokinra Phase 2b FRONTIER 1 trial results in adults living with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis were published in the NEJM. In March 2024, data presented at the American Academy of Dermatology 2024 Annual Meeting showed that, in the Phase 2b FRONTIER 2 trial, icotrokinra maintained high rates of skin clearance through 52 weeks in adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. In August 2024, positive pre-clinical and clinical pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety data for icotrokinra was published in the journal, Scientific Reports. Three Company-sponsored poster presentations and one Company-sponsored oral presentation were delivered at the 2024 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress in September 2024.
JNJ initiated six additional icotrokinra trials in psoriasis and one in UC, as discussed above. All of the trials in the ICONIC program use the 200 mg q.d. immediate release formulation of icotrokinra from the FRONTIER 1 trial. 
In November 2024, we announced positive topline results from ICONIC-LEAD and ICONIC-TOTAL Phase 3 trials of icotrokinra in individuals 12 years of age and older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. In the ICONIC-LEAD trial, once-daily icotrokinra showed significant skin clearance versus placebo in adults and adolescents with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. At week 16, nearly two-thirds (64.7%) of patients treated with icotrokinra achieved IGA scores of 0/1, and 49.6% achieved PASI 90, compared to 8.3% and 4.4% on placebo, respectively. Further increases in response rates continued to be observed at week 24, with 74.1% of patients treated with icotrokinra achieving IGA scores of 0/1, and 64.9% achieving PASI 90. Safety data was found to be consistent with the Phase 2 FRONTIER 1 and 2 trials. A similar proportion of patients experienced adverse events between icotrokinra and placebo, with 49.3% and 
17

Table of Contents
49.1% of participants experiencing a TEAE at week 16. In addition, positive topline results from the Phase 3 ICONIC-TOTAL trial showed once-daily icotrokinra met the primary endpoint of IGA of 0/1 at week 16 compared to placebo.
We believe these positive Phase 3 results confirm the efficacy and safety trends that were observed with the previous Phase 2 FRONTIER 1 and 2 studies, highlighting icotrokinra’s potential as a best-in-class oral agent providing a combination of significant skin clearance with demonstrated tolerability in a once-daily pill for treating plaque psoriasis. We believe these results also continue to validate our innovative peptide technology platform and its effectiveness in creating highly differentiated new chemical entities to address unmet needs in various disease areas. Comprehensive results from both ICONIC-LEAD and ICONIC-TOTAL are being prepared for presentation at upcoming medical congresses and we expect these to be shared with health authorities in planned submissions.
PN-881: AN ORAL IL-17 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST
In the fourth quarter of 2024, we announced the selection of PN-881, a potential best-in-class oral peptide IL-17 antagonist, as a development candidate for the treatment of immune-mediated skin diseases. PN-881 has been evaluated in extensive preclinical studies, including oral stability, potency, tissue distribution, and pharmacokinetics measurements, and evaluation in immunologic pharmacodynamics and preclinical efficacy models. 
Figure 5. PN-881 Potently Inhibits IL-17A and IL-17F 
PN-881 has demonstrated in vitro blockade of IL-17 AA homodimer, FF homodimer and AF heterodimer. In assays using the HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line stimulated with a combination of IL-17 and TNF-a produce IL-6, blocking IL-17 was shown to inhibit IL-6 production. In this assay, PN-881 inhibited 50% of IL-6 production (the IC50) at a concentration of 120 picomoles (“pM”) and showed an IC 90, or 90% inhibition, at 560 pM. This potency was approximately 100-fold greater than the potency of secukinumab, and similar potency to the most potent approved antibody drugs and nanobody therapeutics in development (Figure 5). In multiple preclinical studies with oral dosing, PN-881 showed effective blockade in vivo of IL-17 in serum and skin and achieved pre-clinical proof-of-concept in a skin inflammation rodent disease model.

Table of Contents
IND-enabling, or foreign equivalent, studies of PN-881 are ongoing or planned, including 7-day and 3-month toxicology studies. Planned clinical studies include a Phase 1 single ascending dose (“SAD”) and multiple ascending dose (“MAD”) study expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2025. Results of the Phase 1 trial are expected to inform the design and dosing in a subsequent dose-ranging psoriasis trial. Rapid expansion into other IL-17 mediated diseases, including PsA, HS and axSpA, is expected to be based on results observed in psoriasis studies.
We believe an IL-17 antagonist peptide like PN-881, with best-in-class potential as an oral targeted therapy, may offer an attractive therapeutic option for patients with broad opportunity for multiple indications in addition to psoriasis. We expect to initiate a PN-881 first-in-human Phase 1 study in fourth quarter of 2025.
PN-943
PN-943 is a wholly owned investigational orally delivered gut-restricted alpha 4 beta 7 specific integrin antagonist for IBD. We completed a Phase 2 trial of PN-943 in patients with moderate-to-severe UC in early 2023. We do not intend to dedicate further internal resources to clinical development or contract manufacturing activities for our PN-943 clinical program.
OUR PEPTIDE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM 
Our proprietary technology platform is purposefully built to exploit the advantages of constrained peptides, which are much smaller than antibody-based drugs and may be delivered orally but are big enough to bind and block the difficult targets that antibodies bind and modulate. The platform has been successfully applied to a diverse set of biological targets that has led to several pre-clinical and clinical stage peptide-based new chemical entities, including our clinical stage product candidates, for a variety of clinical indications. Our platform is comprised of a series of tools and methods, including a combination of molecular design, phage display, stability assays, medicinal chemistry, surrogate biomarkers, formulations
, in vitro
 biochemical, cell and tissue-based assays, and 
in vivo
 pharmacology and pharmacokinetic approaches. We apply this platform to the discovery and development of constrained peptides as new drug candidates.
The platform is used to develop potential drug candidates (agonists and antagonists): (i) using the structure of a target, when available, (ii) 
de novo
 when no target structure exists, or (iii) from publicly disclosed peptide starting points. In a structure-based approach, our proprietary molecular design software and structural database of several thousand constrained peptides, termed Vectrix™, are screened to identify suitable scaffolds. The scaffolds identified form the basis of designing and constructing the first set of phage or chemical libraries. The initial hits are identified by either panning or screening such libraries, respectively. When structural information is unavailable for a target, hits are identified by panning a set of 34 proprietary cluster-based phage libraries consisting of millions of constrained peptides. Once the hits are identified, they are optimized using a set of peptide, peptide mimetic and medicinal chemistry techniques that include the incorporation of new or manipulation of existing cyclization-constraints, as well as natural or unnatural amino acids and chemical conjugation or acylation techniques. These techniques are applied to optimize potency, selectivity, stability, exposure and ultimately efficacy. For rusfertide, hit discovery and optimization relied exclusively on medicinal and computational chemistry, with no phage display, to develop potent and selective injectable candidates with enhanced stability and exposure in blood. For injectable products, stability in blood is determined using 
in vitro
 assay techniques to identify chemical and biological sites of degradation, which are then optimized while still maintaining potency and selectivity. Conjugation strategies are used to optimize the exposure of the injected peptide. For icotrokinra, phage display is tightly coupled to medicinal chemistry, structural biology and oral stability techniques to develop potent, selective and orally delivered molecules. Oral stability is profiled in a series of 
in vitro
 and 
ex vivo
 assays that portray the chemical and metabolic barriers a peptide will encounter as it transits the GI and systemic compartments as needed. These metabolically labile spots in the peptides are optimized using medicinal chemistry-based approaches to engineer oral stability while maintaining selectivity and potency. Various 
in vivo
 pharmacology tools are then used to quantify peptide exposure in relevant GI and systemic compartments. This data can be used to optimize required exposure over the required time frame to achieve 
in vivo
 efficacy. This is complemented by formulation technologies to enhance GI and systemic exposure by exploiting the intrinsic stability of our oral peptides. Finally, various biomarkers are also developed to correlate exposure with efficacy to guide candidate selection, dose selection and provide preliminary POC of target engagement in clinical trials.

Discovery and Pre-clinical Activities 
We believe we have built a versatile, well-validated and unique discovery platform. For example, this peptide technology platform has been used to develop product candidates for diverse target classes including G-protein-coupled receptors, ion channels, transporters, cytokines and their receptors for a variety of therapeutic areas. In the future we may tackle other I&I, metabolic and blood disorders and expand our technology platform to provide potential opportunities to pursue a wider variety of diseases that may include oral, topical and systemic approaches. We also intend to progress our platform to achieve systemic bioavailability and activity with oral peptides, macrocycles and peptidomimetics, thereby enabling us to address systemic diseases. Examples of this approach are the discovery and development of icotrokinra, our IL-23R antagonist in collaboration with JNJ, and PN-881, our recently announced IL-17 peptide antagonist product candidate, as described above.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge and experience provide us with certain competitive advantages, we face competition from established and emerging pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. 
Rusfertide
Ruxolitinib, marketed as Jakafi®, was approved in 2014 for the treatment of adults with PV who have inadequate response to or are intolerant to hydroxyurea. Approximately 5,300 PV patients are treated with Jakafi® each year. Besremi®, a ropeginterferon alfa-2b product indicated for the treatment of adults with PV, was approved with a black box warning in November 2021.
We are aware of other investigational compounds under clinical development for treatment of PV, including short interfering RNA approaches aimed at modulating or increasing endogenous hepcidin levels.
Icotrokinra
In psoriasis and PsA, competition will come from companies with approved injectable agents in the IL-17 and IL-12/23 pathway, including Cosentyx®, Taltz®, Siliq®, Tremfya®, and Skyrizi®. Bimekizumab (anti-IL-17A and F, UCB) has completed a positive Phase 3 program in psoriasis. Otezla® (Amgen) was the first oral agent approved in both psoriasis and PsA. The oral JAK inhibitors Xeljanz® (Pfizer) and Rinvoq® are approved in PsA. Several oral small molecules that inhibit the Janus kinase TYK2 are advancing in development. The Bristol Myers Squibb (“BMS”) TYK2 inhibitor, Sotyktu®, was approved for psoriasis in 2022. Second generation allosteric TYK2 inhibitors from Nimbus Therapeutics (recently in-licensed by Takeda) are moving into Phase 3 development, and a molecule from Ventyx Biosciences has initiated Phase 2 development. Several small molecules that inhibit IL-17 have completed Phase 1 development. 
In IBD, competition will come from companies with injectable agents in the anti-integrin class (Entyvio®, Takeda, approved) and the anti-IL-12/23 class that may be approved in the next several years, including JNJ’s Stelara® (approved in UC and CD), Abbvie’s risankizumab (Skyrizi®) (UC and CD Phase 3), JNJ’s guselkumab (Tremfya®) (UC and CD); and Eli Lilly’s mirikizumab (Omvoh®) (UC and CD).
In addition, orally delivered agents with novel mechanisms of action that are approved for or in development and may be approved for UC and/or CD prior to or shortly after the launch of our product candidates can have significant impact in the competitive environment, including:
●
JAK inhibitors: The pan-JAK tofacitinib (Xeljanz®) is approved in UC. The next-generation selective JAK1/3 inhibitors, including Abbvie’s upadacitinib (Rinvoq®), were approved in UC and CD in 2022. Pfizer’s selective JAK1/TEC inhibitor ritlecitinib is in Phase 2 development for UC and CD;

●
S1P1 receptor modulators: BMS’s ozanimod (Zeposia®) and Pfizer’s etrasimod (Velsipity®) are approved in UC. Etrasimod is being studied in CD, though ozanimod was not found to show efficacy in CD; and
●
Eli Lilly is developing MORF-057, an oral small molecule targeting α4β7, which is progressing in Phase 2 development in UC and CD. Other oral small molecules targeting α4β7 from Gilead and Ensho Therapeutics are in early clinical development. Many other agents are in early-stage development in IBD, including injectable anti-TLIA antibodies by Pfizer and Merck, and Teva and Sanofi which have recently presented positive Phase 2 results in IBD.
PN-881
In competitive areas, we believe there is a strong need for a differentiated oral approach. The injectable mAbs Cosentyx and Taltz targeting IL-17 AA and AF are approved in psoriasis, PsA, and SpA. Cosentyx was also recently the first IL-17 inhibitor approved in HS. Siliq, a mAb to the IL-17 receptor, is approved in psoriasis only and carries a black box warning for suicidal ideations. Bimzelx is a mAb that targets IL-17 AA, AF and FF. It is approved in psoriasis, PsA, HS, SS and nr-axSpA. Sonelokimab (MoonLake) is an injectable nanobody with IL-17 AA, AF and FF activity and has demonstrated POC in Phase 2 in psoriasis, PsA, and HS. There are several oral IL-17 small molecules in clinical development with the most advanced, DC-853 (Lilly via acquisition of DICE Therapeutics) in a Phase 2b trial in psoriasis. JNJ and Sanofi are also developing small molecules.

On July 27, 2021, we entered into an Amended and Restated License and Collaboration Agreement (the “JNJ License and Collaboration Agreement”) with JNJ, which amended and restated the License and Collaboration Agreement, effective July 13, 2017, by and between us and JNJ (the “Original Agreement”), as amended by the first amendment, effective May 7, 2019 (the “First Amendment”). The JNJ License and Collaboration Agreement, which relates to the development, manufacture and commercialization of oral IL-23 receptor antagonist drug candidates and enables JNJ to develop collaboration compounds for multiple indications, was further amended in November 2024. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Overview” and Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
Research Collaboration and License Agreement with Zealand Pharma A/S 
In June 2012, we entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement (the “Zealand Agreement”) with Zealand Pharma A/S (“Zealand”) to identify, optimize and develop novel disulfide-rich peptides to discover a hepcidin mimetic. We amended this agreement on February 28, 2014, at which point we assumed responsibility for the development program. See Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments” and Note 7 and Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop, strengthen, and maintain our 
21

Table of Contents
proprietary position in the field of peptide-based therapeutics that may be important for the development of our business. We will also take advantage of regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available.
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same. For more information, please see Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
We own or co-own 30 issued U.S. patents, over 68 granted ex-U.S. patents, and numerous U.S. and ex-U.S. patent applications related to our clinical assets. We possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the discovery, development and commercialization of peptide based therapeutic products. Our proprietary intellectual property, including patent and non-patent intellectual property, is generally directed to, for example, peptide-based therapeutic compounds and compositions, methods of using these peptide-based therapeutic compounds and compositions to treat or prevent disease, methods of manufacturing peptide-based therapeutic compounds and compositions, and other proprietary technologies and processes related to our lead product development candidates. Specific patents and patent applications are directed to compositions of α
4
β7 integrin peptides, IL-23R antagonist peptides, IL-17 antagonist peptides and hepcidin mimetics peptides, as well as methods of synthesizing and using these peptides to treat disorders. Applications are currently pending in the United States and other major jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, Japan, and Europe. We expect our patents and patent applications, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from October 2033 to December 2044 (excluding possible patent term extensions).
Our objective is to continue to expand our portfolio of patents and patent applications in order to protect our clinical assets and related peptide-based drug technologies.
We also license patents and patent applications directed to processes and methods related to our technology platform. These patents have issued in the United States and other major jurisdictions, including Australia and Europe. Some licensed patents are expired. Material aspects of our technology platform are protected by trade secrets and confidentiality agreements.
In addition to the above, we have established expertise and development capabilities focused in the areas of pre-clinical research and development, manufacturing and manufacturing process scale-up, quality control, quality assurance, regulatory affairs and clinical trial design and implementation. We believe that our focus and expertise will help us develop products based on our proprietary intellectual property.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent.
The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended 
22

Table of Contents
once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.
Trade Secrets
We rely on trade secrets to protect certain aspects of our technology, particularly in relation to our technology platform. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For more information, please see Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
Manufacturing
We contract with third parties for the manufacturing of our product candidates for pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and eventually for commercial supplies and intend to continue to do so in the future. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and we have no plans to build any owned clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We believe that the use of contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) eliminates the need for us to directly invest in manufacturing facilities, equipment and additional staff. We have established a global supply chain for raw material, active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”), drug product manufacturing and distribution. We work with contract manufacturers in the United States, Europe and Asia. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, our personnel and consultants have extensive manufacturing and quality control experience overseeing CMOs. We regularly consider second source or back-up manufacturers for both API and drug product manufacturing. To date, our third-party manufacturers have met the manufacturing requirements for our product candidates. We expect third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing supplies needed for our product candidates to meet anticipated full-scale commercial demands, and we have selected CMOs that can manufacture our product candidates for our ongoing and planned clinical trials as well as commercial supplies. We currently engage CMOs on a “fee for services” basis for our current development and clinical supplies. 
Government Regulation
The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates.
U.S. Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
23

Table of Contents
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
●
completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practices (“GLP”) regulations;
●
submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
●
approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
●
performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
●
submission to the FDA of an NDA (or Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for a biologic product);
●
satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
●
satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
●
satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements and the clinical protocol; and
●
FDA review and approval of the NDA.
Pre-clinical Studies
Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. These pre-clinical studies must comply with GLP. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature to the FDA as part of an IND. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements. GCP requirements mandate that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND (or equivalent international submission). In addition, an IRB or ethics committee must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial at all institutions participating in the clinical trial before it commences at that site. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific time frames to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on www.clinicaltrials.gov.
24

Table of Contents
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
●
Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and is tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
●
Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the investigational drug product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
●
Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate labeling information (labeling) for the safe and efficacious administration for the labeling of the product.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or ethics committee can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Marketing Approval
Following successful completion of the required clinical testing and the results of the pre-clinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to an application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) guidelines, the FDA has a target of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that is adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. REMS plans typically include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the requested information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. After the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by 
25

Table of Contents
the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or pre-clinical testing for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even after submission of this additional information, the FDA may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product. It may also require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling or require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval. In addition, the FDA may mandate testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS. This can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of alterations, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
Fast Track Designation
The FDA has various programs, such as fast track designation. These programs are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients faster. The sponsor of a new drug may request fast track designation concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. A product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety. Fast track designation provides additional opportunities for interaction with the FDA’s review team and may allow for rolling review of NDA components before the completed application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. However, the FDA’s time goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. The FDA may decide to rescind the fast track designation if it determines that the qualifying criteria no longer apply.
Orphan Designation
The FDA may grant orphan designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. The FDA may also grant the designation if the disease affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Drugs or 
26

Table of Contents
biologics with orphan designation are not subject to a PDUFA fee upon the submission of an NDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
In the United States, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same product for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances. Such circumstances include a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan designated product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.
There is some uncertainty with respect to the FDA’s interpretation of the scope of orphan drug exclusivity. Historically, exclusivity was specific to the orphan indication for which the drug or biologic was approved. As a result, the scope of exclusivity was interpreted as preventing approval of a competing product. However, in 2021, the federal court in Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Becerra, suggested that orphan drug exclusivity covers the full scope of the orphan-designated “disease or condition” regardless of whether a drug obtained approval for a narrower use. 
Breakthrough Therapy Designation 
A sponsor can request designation of a drug candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval and priority review. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. The FDA may decide to rescind the breakthrough designation if it determines that the qualifying criteria no longer apply.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA. These regulations include requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program user fee requirements for any marketed products.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies. They are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
27

Table of Contents
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse side effects of unanticipated severity or frequency, problems with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include:
●
restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
●
fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
●
refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
●
product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
●
injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved prescribing information. The FDA and other agencies enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
Coverage and Reimbursement 
Sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the cost of such products will be covered and adequately reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and reducing reimbursements for medical products and services by challenging the prices and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
There is no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. Coverage determination can be a time-consuming and costly process that may require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained or applied consistently. Even if reimbursement is provided, market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected if the amount of payment for our products proves to be unprofitable for health care providers or less profitable than alternative treatments, or due to administrative burdens.
In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products candidates, once approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the ACA, enacted in March 2010, has had and is expected to continue to have a 
28

Table of Contents
significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA imposes a significant annual fee on certain companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. The ACA also increased the Medicaid rebate rate and expanded the rebate program to include Medicaid managed care organizations. It also contains substantial new provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce the growth of health care spending, enhance remedies against health care fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the health care industry, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms, any or all of which may affect our business. 
There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, President Trump signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain ACA requirements or otherwise circumvent some of the health insurance mandates. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation to repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been enacted. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, included a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on some individuals who do not maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and the medical device tax, and also eliminated the health insurance tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amends the ACA to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole,” and increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in the Medicare Part D program. The Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”), enacted August 16, 2022, aims to control prescription drug prices in the upcoming years. The IRA will allow the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to cap out-of-pocket costs in 2025 and to negotiate prescription drug prices in 2026 for the first time. Additionally, the IRA provides a new “inflation rebate” covering Medicare patients beginning in 2023 to prevent rapid and arbitrary price increases in prescription drugs. These and any other legislation or healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration may impact the ACA and our business. There may also be further challenges to the ACA, and new laws may also result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding.
Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. This scrutiny has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the Trump administration implemented drug pricing reform through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the administration’s proposals The FDA also released a final rule, effective November 30, 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule was delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers.
Federal and state legislatures have become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare therapies. 
It is uncertain whether and how future legislation, whether domestic or foreign, could affect prospects for our product candidates or what actions payors for health care treatment and services may take in response to such health care reform proposals or legislation. Adoption of price controls and other cost-containment measures, and adoption of more 
29

Table of Contents
restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures reforms may prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.
Other Health Care Laws and Compliance Requirements
We will also be subject to health care regulation and enforcement by the federal and state government and foreign governments in which we will conduct our business once our products are approved. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic health care transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; the criminal health care fraud statutes under HIPAA also prohibit persons and entities from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services; the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws that prohibit any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid; and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the CMS information related to payments and other transfers of value made to various healthcare professionals including physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, certified nurse-midwives and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning on January 1, 2023, California Assembly Bill 1278 requires California physicians and surgeons to notify patients of the Open Payments database established under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act.
The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. We may be subject to state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, such as California’s Confidentiality of Medical Information Act and Washington’s My Health My Data Act, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. In addition, we may be subject to reporting requirements under state transparency laws, as well as state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts certain payments that may be made to health care providers and entities. In addition, certain states and local jurisdictions require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
Even when HIPAA and state health information privacy laws do not apply, according to the FTC and state Attorneys General, violating consumers’ privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act and state consumer protection laws.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exceptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If we are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including significant administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, exclusion of products from reimbursement under U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations.

Government Regulation Outside of the United States 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.
Drug and Biologic Development Process in the European Union (“EU”)
All clinical trials included in applications for marketing authorization for human medicines in the EU must be carried out in accordance with EU regulations. This means that such clinical trials must comply with EU clinical trial legislation, as well as ethical principles equivalent to those set out in the EU and in Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein (together, the European Economic Area, or “EEA”), including adhering to international good clinical practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. The conduct of clinical trials in the EU is governed by the EU Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No. 536/2014 (“CTR”) which entered into force on January 31, 2022.
Under the CTR, a sponsor may submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial through a centralized EU clinical trials portal. One national regulatory authority (the reporting EU Member State proposed by the applicant) will take the lead in validating and evaluating the application consult and coordinate with the other concerned Member States. If an application is rejected, it may be amended and resubmitted through the EU clinical trials portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor may start the clinical trial in all concerned Member States. However, a concerned EU Member State may in limited circumstances declare an “opt-out” from an approval and prevent the clinical trial from being conducted in such Member State. The CTR also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting and introduces enhanced transparency requirements such as mandatory submission of a summary of the clinical trial results to the EU Database (“CTIS”). Since January 31, 2023, submission of initial clinical trial applications via CTIS is mandatory, and by January 31, 2025, all ongoing trials approved under the former Clinical Trials Directive will need to comply with the CTR and have to be transitioned to CTIS. 
National laws, regulations, and the applicable GCP and Good Laboratory Practice standards must also be respected during the conduct of the trials, including the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (“ICH”) guidelines on GCP and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Drug Marketing Authorization 
In the EEA, after completion of all required clinical testing, pharmaceutical products may only be placed on the market after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”). To obtain an MA of a drug under EU regulatory systems, an applicant can submit a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) through, amongst others, a centralized or decentralized procedure.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single MA that is issued by the European Commission (“EC”) following the scientific assessment of the application by the EMA that is valid for all EU Member States as well as in the three additional EEA Member States. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific medicinal products, including for medicines developed by means of certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products (gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue engineered medicines), and medicinal products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases (HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and viral diseases). For medicinal products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA before May 20, 2004 and indicated for the treatment of other diseases, medicinal products that constitute significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovations or for which the grant of an MA through the centralized procedure would be in the interest of public health at EU level, an applicant may voluntarily submit an application for an MA through the centralized procedure.
Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), established at the EMA, is responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a drug. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing MA. Under the centralized procedure, the timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the CHMP is, in principle, 210 days 
31

Table of Contents
from receipt of a valid MAA. However, this timeline excludes clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CHMP, so the overall process typically takes a year or more, unless the application is eligible for an accelerated assessment. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. Upon request, the CHMP can reduce the time frame to 150 days if the applicant provides sufficient justification for an accelerated assessment. The CHMP will provide a positive opinion regarding the application only if it meets certain quality, safety and efficacy requirements. This opinion is then transmitted to the EC, which has the ultimate authority for granting an MA within 67 days after receipt of the CHMP opinion.
Medicines that fall outside the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure have three routes to authorization: (i) they can be authorized under the centralized procedure if they concern a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if their authorization would be in the interest of public health; (ii) they can be authorized under a decentralized procedure where an applicant applies for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU Member State; or (iii) they can be authorized in an EU Member State in accordance with that state’s national procedures and then be authorized in other EU countries by a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization (mutual recognition procedure).
The decentralized procedure permits companies to file identical MA applications for a medicinal product to the competent authorities in various EU Member States simultaneously if such medicinal product has not received marketing approval in any EU Member State before. This procedure is available for pharmaceutical products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. The competent authority of a single EU Member State, known as the reference EU Member State, is appointed to review the application and provide an assessment report. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials, including a draft summary of product characteristics, and draft labeling and package leaflet, to the reference EU Member State and concerned EU Member States. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Subsequently, each concerned EU Member State must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If an EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the EC, whose decision is binding for all EU Member States.
All new MAAs must include a Risk Management Plan (“RMP”), describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. RMPs are continually modified and updated throughout the lifetime of the medicine as new information becomes available. An updated RMP must be submitted: (i) at the request of EMA or a national competent authority, or (ii) whenever the risk-management system is modified, especially as the result of new information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit-risk profile or as a result of an important pharmacovigilance or risk-minimization milestone being reached. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Since October 20, 2023, all RMPs for centrally authorized products are published by the EMA, subject only to limited redactions.
MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may subsequently be renewed on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. Once renewed, the MA is valid for an unlimited period unless the EC or the national competent authority decides on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance to proceed with only one additional five-year renewal. Applications for renewal must be made to the EMA at least nine months before the five-year period expires.
European Data Protection Laws
The collection and use of personal health data and other personal data in the EU is governed by the provisions of the European General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”) and related data protection laws in individual EU Member States. The GDPR imposes strict requirements on the processing of personal data, including the legal basis for the processing, the information that has to be provided to individuals before their data is processed,

Table of Contents
personal data breaches which may have to be notified to national data protection authorities and data subjects, the measures to be taken when engaging processors, and the technical and organization measures to ensure the security and confidentiality of the personal data. EU Member States may also have additional requirements for health, genetic, and biometric data through their national legislation. The GDPR also imposes restrictions on the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EU that do not provide an adequate level of data protection. To enable such transfers, appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses (“SCCs”) must be in place. When relying on SCCs, data exporters are also required to conduct a transfer risk assessment to verify if anything in the law and/or practices of the third country may impinge on the effectiveness of the SCCs in the context of the transfer at stake and, if so, to identify and adopt supplementary measures that are necessary to bring the level of protection of the data transferred to the EU standard of essential equivalence. Where no supplementary measure is suitable, the data exporter should avoid, suspend or terminate the transfer. Alternatively, such transfers can be based on an adequacy decision by the EU commission. Regarding transfers to the US, the EU commission issued an adequacy decision for transfers to companies that are certified under the new EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which entered into force on June 10, 2023.
Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in significant monetary fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater, other administrative penalties and a number of criminal offenses for organizations and, in certain cases, their directors and officers, as well as civil liability claims from individuals whose personal data was processed.
