ITEM 3.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
From time to time, we may be involved in various claims and legal proceedings relating to claims arising out of our operations. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. If we are served with any such complaints, we will assess at that time any contingencies for which we may need to reserve. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.
Shenzhen Beike Biotechnology Co. Ltd. Arbitration
In 2020, we received a Request for Arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce, International Court of Arbitration. The arbitration relates to a license, development, and commercialization agreement that Altor entered into with Beike in 2014, which agreement was amended and restated in 2017, pursuant to which Altor granted to Beike an exclusive license to use, research, develop and commercialize products based on ANKTIVA in China for human therapeutic uses. In the arbitration, Beike is asserting a claim for breach of contract under the license agreement. Among other things, Beike alleges that we failed to use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Beike materials and data related to ANKTIVA. Beike is seeking specific performance and declaratory relief for the alleged breaches. On September 25, 2020, the parties entered into a standstill and tolling agreement (standstill agreement) under which, among other things, the parties affirmed they will perform certain of their obligations under the license agreement by specified dates and agreed that all deadlines in the arbitration are indefinitely extended. The standstill agreement could be terminated by any party on ten calendar days’ notice, and upon termination, the parties had the right to pursue claims arising from the license agreement in any appropriate tribunal. On March 20, 2023, we terminated the standstill agreement, and on April 11, 2023, Beike served an amended Request for Arbitration. We served an Answer and Counterclaims on May 19, 2023. Beike served a Reply to our counterclaims on June 21, 2023. Beike served its Statement of Claim on March 22, 2024, and the company served its Statement of Defense and Counterclaim on June 21, 2024, and Beike served its Statement of Defense to the Counterclaim on August 2, 2024. After the parties completed discovery, Beike served its Reply and Defense to Counterclaim on January 17, 2025. The hearing in the arbitration is scheduled to begin on June 9, 2025. Given that the proceeding is in the pre-hearing stages, it remains too early to evaluate the likely outcome of the case or to estimate any range of potential loss. We believe the claims asserted against the company lack merit and intend to defend the case, and to pursue our counterclaims, vigorously.
Securities Class Action
On June 30, 2023, a putative securities class action complaint, captioned 
Salzman v. ImmunityBio, Inc. et al.
, No. 3:23-cv-01216-GCP-VET, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against the company and three of its officers and/or directors, asserting violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Stemming from the company’s disclosure on May 11, 2023 that it had received an FDA CRL stating, among other things, that it could not approve the company’s BLA for its then product candidate, ANKTIVA with BCG for the treatment of adult patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with CIS with or without papillary tumors, in its present form due to deficiencies related to its pre-license inspection of the company’s third-party CMOs, the complaint alleges that the defendants had previously made materially false and misleading statements and/or omitted material adverse facts regarding its third-party CMOs and the prospects for regulatory approval of the BLA. The complaint did not specify the amount of damages being sought. On September 27, 2023, the court appointed a lead plaintiff, approved their selection of lead counsel, and re-captioned the case 
In re ImmunityBio, Inc. Securities Litigation,
 No. 3:23-cv-01216. On November 17, 2023, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which named the same defendants and asserted the same claims as the previous complaint. On January 8, 2024, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On June 20, 2024, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the motion to dismiss. On July 16, 2024, the lead plaintiff notified the court that he would proceed with his current pleading, and the defendants answered the complaint on August 29, 2024. On January 25, 2025, following a mediation and the parties’ agreement in principle to settle the securities class action for $10.5 million, the lead plaintiff filed an unopposed motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement. The settlement is subject to preliminary and final approval by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. A preliminary approval hearing is scheduled for March 7, 2025.
As a result of the foregoing, the company recorded legal settlement expense of $10.5 million in 
selling, general and administrative expense,
 on the consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2024 and a corresponding amount in 
accrued expenses and other liabilities
, on the consolidated balance sheet. The company believes that approximately $6.0 million of this amount will be paid by the company’s insurers, which will be recorded upon receipt.

To the extent the court does not grant final approval of the settlement described above, the company is unable to estimate a range of loss, if any, that could result were there to be an adverse final decision in this action. In this event and if an unfavorable outcome were to occur, it is possible that the impact could be material to the company’s results of operations in the period(s) in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable.
Altor BioScience, LLC, and NantCell, Inc. Matters Against Dr. Hing Wong and HCW Biologics, Inc.
On December 23, 2022, Altor and NantCell filed an arbitration demand against Dr. Hing Wong, former CEO of Altor and NantCell. The demand asserts claims for breach of Dr. Wong’s contracts with the companies, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, conversion, fraudulent concealment, unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, and replevin. The same day, Dr. Wong filed an arbitration demand seeking a declaratory judgment finding that Dr. Wong is not liable to Altor or NantCell for any of their claims. The parties agreed to consolidate the arbitration filings in one proceeding, and on January 23, 2023, Dr. Wong filed an Answering Statement denying the claims.
Also, on December 23, 2022 Altor and NantCell filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against HCW, Dr. Wong’s new company. Altor’s and NantCell’s complaint asserts claims for misappropriation of trade secrets under both Florida and federal law, inducement of breach of contract, tortious interference with contractual relations, inducement of breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, unjust enrichment, replevin, request for assignment of patents and patent applications, and establishment of a constructive trust. On January 31, 2023, HCW filed motions to compel arbitration of Altor’s and NantCell’s claims, or in the alternative to stay or dismiss them. Altor and NantCell filed an opposition to the motions on February 14, 2023, and HCW filed reply papers on February 21, 2023. At a hearing on April 18, 2023, the court heard argument and requested supplemental briefing. After the hearing, the parties reached an agreement to consolidate all claims in a single arbitration proceeding. On May 1, 2023, we filed our arbitration demand asserting the same claims against HCW that were asserted in the federal court complaint. On May 15, 2023, HCW filed an Answering Statement denying the claims. The hearing in the consolidated arbitration took place from May 20, 2024 to May 30, 2024. 
On July 13, 2024, we entered into a Settlement with HCW and Dr. Hing Wong to resolve the claims asserted in the consolidated arbitration and related matters. Under the terms of the Settlement, in part and for no monetary consideration from ImmunityBio, HCW transferred and assigned to ImmunityBio molecules (along with other related assets, including master cell banks, clinical trial protocols, inventory and FDA documents), controlled by HCW that were generated through the use of a TF Platform related to the human TGF-β receptor and TGF-β traps, including, without limitation, HCW9218, HCW9219, HCW9209 and any derivatives thereof or therefrom, including assignment of all patents, know-how and all other intellectual property existing as of the Settlement effective date and thereafter that is necessary or reasonably useful for the exploitation of such TGF-β molecules, with the exception that future reasonably useful intellectual property is the subject of a non-exclusive license to ImmunityBio. For indications outside of oncology, ImmunityBio has agreed to grant an exclusive license back to HCW for the transferred intellectual property for TGF-β products, and a non-exclusive license for neoadjuvant ovarian cancer, subject to certain requirements.
In addition, the Settlement provides to ImmunityBio a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, exclusive license to exploit fusion proteins, molecules and/or antibodies created utilizing the TF Platform directed to the receptors of PDL-1, IL-7, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, and IL-21 in the oncology field. Furthermore, the Settlement provides additional license terms including, without limitation, a non-exclusive license to ImmunityBio to exploit HCW9201, another fusion protein, and the anti-tissue factor based antibody HCW9101 and the linked resins to manufacture and purify the fusion proteins described above, as well as a right of first refusal for ImmunityBio with respect to any other fusion protein developed by HCW using the TF Platform going forward.
Pursuant to the Settlement, the parties agreed to mutual, full and complete releases. On December 23 and 24, 2024, the company dismissed the consolidated arbitration claims and a related action in the Delaware Court of Chancery in light of the Settlement.

Van Luven, Barbieri and Shin Derivative Actions
On October 29, 2024, a shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against the members of our Board of Directors and certain officers, captioned 
Van Luven v. Soon-Shiong et al.
, Case No. 3:24-cv-02014-GPCL-VET. The plaintiff purports to bring the action derivatively on behalf of ImmunityBio, and ImmunityBio is a nominal defendant to the action. Stemming from the company’s May 11, 2023 disclosure that it had received an FDA CRL stating, among other things, that it could not approve the company’s BLA for its then product candidate, ANKTIVA with BCG for the treatment of adult patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with CIS with or without papillary tumors, in its present form due to deficiencies related to its pre-license inspection of the company’s third-party CMOs, the derivative complaint alleges that the individual defendants authorized or permitted materially false and misleading statements and/or omitted material adverse facts regarding ImmunityBio’s third-party CMOs and the prospects for regulatory approval of the ANKTIVA BLA. The derivative complaint asserts claims for violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act as well as claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets. The derivative complaint seeks unspecified damages on behalf of the company, disgorgement or restitution, declaratory relief, and an award of costs and expenses to the derivative plaintiff, including attorneys’ fees. The court has entered an order extending the defendants’ deadline to respond to the complaint to April 18, 2025.
On February 25, 2025, a second shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against certain members of our Board of Directors and certain officers, captioned

Carlson Derivative Action
On November 20, 2024, a shareholder derivative action was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the company’s Founder, Executive Chairman, Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer and principal stockholder, Dr. Soon-Shiong, certain affiliates of Dr. Soon-Shiong, certain other members of management, and members of the company’s Board of Directors who serve on the Board of Directors’ Related Party Transaction Committee, captioned 
Carlson v. Soon-Shiong, et al.,
 Case No. 2024-1195-VCL. The plaintiff purports to bring the action derivatively on behalf of ImmunityBio, and ImmunityBio is a nominal defendant to the action. The plaintiff alleges that the previously disclosed September 2023 financing transactions between the company and Dr. Soon-Shiong and his affiliates were not fair to the company. In particular, the plaintiff alleges that the transactions were timed to benefit Dr. Soon-Shiong and his affiliates during a temporary decline in the company’s stock price, resulting in an artificially low conversion price for certain convertible promissory notes that were among the transactions, when defendants knew the company’s stock price would increase following the company’s imminent resubmission of a BLA for, and the subsequent FDA approval of, ANKTIVA with BCG for the treatment of adult patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with CIS with or without papillary tumors. The complaint alleges that defendants breached their fiduciary duties by entering into these transactions at that time and on those terms, thereby unjustly enriching Dr. Soon-Shiong and his affiliates. The derivative complaint seeks unspecified damages on behalf of the company, corporate governance changes with respect to related-party transactions, and an award of costs and expenses to the derivative plaintiff, including attorneys’ fees. On February 17, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.

ImmunityBio is a vertically-integrated commercial stage biotechnology company developing next-generation therapies that bolster the natural immune system to defeat cancers and infectious diseases. The company’s range of immunotherapy platforms, alone and together, act to drive an immune response with the goal of creating durable immune memory generating safe protection against disease. We are applying our science and platforms to treating cancers, including the development of potential cancer vaccines, as well as developing immunotherapies and cell therapies that we believe sharply reduce or eliminate the need for standard high-dose chemotherapy. These platforms and their associated product candidates are designed to be more effective, accessible, and easily administered than current standards of care in oncology and infectious diseases.
Our Approved Product – ANKTIVA
Our lead biologic product ANKTIVA is a novel first-in-class IL-15 receptor superagonist antibody-cytokine fusion protein. On April 22, 2024, the FDA approved our product, ANKTIVA with BCG for the treatment of adult patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with CIS with or without papillary tumors (the “approved product”). ANKTIVA was approved with a label indicating an immunological mechanism of action which proliferates and activates NK, CD8+ and memory T cells without the proliferation of immunosuppressive T-reg cells leading to the establishment of memory T cells. We began commercial distribution of our approved product in May 2024. 
We believe there is potential for ANKTIVA to become a therapeutic foundation across all phases of treatment, including in adjunctive therapy, to amplify, reactivate or extend the efficacy of standard of care.

ANKTIVA is being clinically evaluated in multiple oncology indications. 
We believe that other oncology indications with registration potential for ANKTIVA include other types of NMIBC (
BCG-unresponsive papillary, 
BCG-naïve CIS and BCG-naïve papillary), lung, colorectal, prostate and ovarian cancers, and GBM and NHL. 
Data from multiple clinical trials suggest ANKTIVA has potential to enhance the activity of therapeutic mAbs, including CPIs (e.g., pembrolizumab/Keytruda), across a wide range of tumor types, including lung cancer. Further, ANKTIVA has been observed to increase lymphocyte count in healthy adults, making it a potential therapy to rescue lymphopenia. We are also exploring or pursuing several other studies of ANKTIVA in combination with our other product candidates, including in prostate cancer (ANKTIVA in combination with hAd5 PSA), colon cancer (ANKTIVA in combination with hAd5 TriAd), and NHL (ANKTIVA in combination with rituximab). 
We are also exploring ANKTIVA in infectious diseases, including HIV and long COVID.

Significant Developments 
The following is a summary of selected significant developments affecting our business that occurred since the filing of our Quarterly Report dated September 30, 2024 with the SEC on November 12, 2024:
•
ANKTIVA received a J-code assigned by the CMS in the U.S. for ANKTIVA, which became effective January 1, 2025. 
•
With a permanent J-code awarded in January 2025, our February 2025 ANKTIVA unit sales volume grew 97% over unit sales volume in December 2024 and 67% over unit sales volume in January 2025.
•
We completed the submission of MAAs for the treatment of patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with CIS with or without papillary tumors for ANKTIVA in combination with BCG to the MHRA in the UK in November 2024 and to the EMA in the EU in December 2024. Both MAAs were accepted for review, with the potential for approval in the UK and EU by 2026.
•
In collaboration with Serum Institute, and in connection with our exclusive global supply arrangement that we announced during 2024, in February 2025 the FDA authorized an EAP allowing us to provide rBCG developed by Serum Institute to urologists to address the TICE BCG shortage in any settings where TICE BCG is approved, and we are also testing rBCG in an FDA-approved trial in the U.S. Serum Institute’s GMP capacity to manufacture large-scale volumes of rBCG, already tested for safety and efficacy in clinical trials in Europe in subjects with NMIBC, aims to address the shortage of TICE BCG, which we believe will help to ensure a reliable supply for patients in need. We expect to begin shipments of rBCG pursuant to the EAP during the first quarter of 2025. 
•
In January 2025, we announced a collaboration and supply agreement with BeiGene, Ltd. (to be renamed to BeOne Medicines, Ltd.) to conduct a confirmatory randomized Phase 3 clinical trial combining BeOne’s tislelizumab, a PD-1 CPI, and ANKTIVA in participants with advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have acquired resistance to immune CPI therapy. 
•
On February 27, 2025, the FDA granted us RMAT designation for ANKTIVA and CAR-NK (PD-L1 t-haNK) in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy/radiotherapy indicated for the reversal of lymphopenia and treatment of multiply relapsed locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. This RMAT designation follows clinical data of ALC and significant overall survival correlations in QUILT trials across multiple tumor types including third-line or greater metastatic pancreatic cancer, checkpoint relapsed NSCLC, and supportive data from healthy volunteers. The reversal of lymphopenia by our IL-15 receptor superagonist is consistent with the mechanism of action of ANKTIVA demonstrating proliferation and activation of NK cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and memory T cells without upregulation of suppressive T-reg cells and approved in the ANKTIVA label (approved for the treatment of adult patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with CIS with or without papillary tumors). We intend to submit a BLA for the indication of reversal of lymphopenia in patients receiving standard of care chemotherapy and/or radiation and for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer which includes the first-in-class CAR-NK (PD-L1 t-haNK), and to provide data from fully enrolled clinical trials in metastatic pancreatic cancer (QUILT 88) and in checkpoint relapsed NSCLC (QUILT 3055, NSCLC Cohort) patients, as well as lymphopenia reversal across multiple tumor types (QUILT 3055, all Cohorts), with supportive data of lymphocyte proliferation in healthy volunteers (QUILT 1004). In addition, we intend to file an EAP for ANKTIVA and PD-L1 t-haNK in combination with standard of care chemotherapy/radiotherapy and to submit the protocol to the FDA.

Our Pipeline 
Our proprietary platforms for the development of biologic products and product candidates include: (i) cytokine fusion proteins, (ii) vaccine vectors, and (iii) cell therapies. As of December 2024, our platforms have generated nine first-in-human therapeutic agents (including one agent approved by the FDA) that are currently or planned to be studied in clinical trials in liquid and solid tumors. These indications are among the most frequent and lethal cancer types and where there are high failure rates for existing standards of care or no available effective treatment. We are constantly monitoring and prioritizing clinical development based upon the availability of our resources and the efficacy and market developments of our competitors’ products and product candidates, among other factors.
Our platforms and their associated product and product candidates are designed to attack cancer and infectious pathogens by activating both the innate immune system, including NK cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages, as well as the adaptive immune system comprising B and T cells, in an orchestrated manner. The goal of this potentially best-in-class approach is to generate immunogenic cell death thereby eliminating rogue cells from the body whether they are cancerous or virally-infected. Our ultimate goal is to overcome the limitations of current treatments, such as CPIs, by turning immunologically cold, MHC-deficient tumors into hot tumors, and/or reducing the need for standard high-dose chemotherapy in cancer by employing a coordinated approach to establish “immunological memory” that confers long-term benefit for the patient. 
Operating Results
Until April 2024, we had no clinical products approved for commercial sale and thus had not generated any revenue from therapeutic and vaccine product candidates that are or were under development. Now that we have received FDA approval for ANKTIVA, we have begun to generate revenue although we expect it to take some time to generate significant revenue from our approved product and we can provide no assurance when, or if, this will occur. We began commercial distribution of our approved product in May 2024; however, we can provide no assurance with respect to our future revenues, market acceptance, reimbursement from third-party payors, or the profitability of our approved product or any other product candidate for which we may obtain approval. We do not expect additional revenue from our other product candidates unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our other product candidates, and we do not know when, or if, this will occur. 
We expect to continue to incur significant expenses as we seek to expand our business, including commercializing our approved product, seeking regulatory approvals, conducting research and development across multiple therapeutic areas, participating in clinical trial activities, continuing to acquire or in-license technologies, maintaining, protecting and expanding our intellectual property, and increasing our manufacturing capabilities. Furthermore, the timing and magnitude of our approved product sales and revenue remain uncertain and may take a significant amount of time to materialize, if ever.
We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception and, as of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $3.4 billion. During the
 years ended
 December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, net losses attributable to ImmunityBio common stockholders were $413.6 million, $583.2 million, and $416.6 million, respectively. Substantially all of our net losses resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with our ongoing clinical trials and operations, our research and development programs, and from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations, including stock-based compensation expense. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had 680 employees. Personnel of related companies who provide corporate, general and administrative, certain research and development, a
nd 
other support services under our shared services agreement with NantWorks are not included in this number. See

Collaboration Agreements
We anticipate that strategic collaborations will continue to be an integral part of our operations, providing opportunities to leverage our partners’ expertise and capabilities to gain access to new markets for our approved product and acquire new technologies or further expand the potential of our technologies, approved product and product candidates across relevant platforms. We believe we are well positioned to become a leader in immunotherapy due to our broad and vertically-integrated platforms and through complementary strategic partnerships.
We believe that our innovative approach to orchestrate and combine therapies for optimal immune system response will become a therapeutic foundation across multiple indications. Additionally, we believe that data from multiple clinical trials indicates ANKTIVA has broad potential to enhance the activity of therapeutic mAbs, including CPIs, across a wide range of tumor types and potentially rescue lymphopenia by proliferation and activation of NK and T cells. We may also enter into supply arrangements for various investigational agents to be used in our clinical trials. See Part I, Item 1.

Contingent Value Rights
In connection with our 2017 acquisition of Altor, we issued CVRs under which we agreed to pay the prior stockholders of Altor approximately $304.0 million of contingent consideration upon calendar-year worldwide net sales of ANKTIVA exceeding $1.0 billion prior to December 31, 2026, with amounts payable in cash or shares of our common stock or a combination thereof. As of December 31, 2024, Dr. Soon-Shiong, our Founder, Executive Chairman and Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer, and his related party hold approximately $139.8 million of net sales CVRs.

Components of our Results of Operations
Product Revenue, Net
Prior to the approval of ANKTIVA for commercial sale, we primarily generated revenues from non-exclusive license agreements related to our cell lines, the sale of our bioreactors and related consumables, and grant programs. The company expects to continue to generate revenue from these programs. 
Until April 2024, we had no clinical products approved for commercial sale and thus had not generated any revenue from therapeutic and vaccine product candidates that are or were under development. Now that we have received FDA approval for ANKTIVA, we have begun to generate revenue although we expect it to take some time to generate significant revenue from our approved product and we can provide no assurance when, or if, this will occur. We began commercial distribution of our approved product in May 2024; however, we can provide no assurance with respect to our future revenues, market acceptance, reimbursement from third-party payors, or the profitability of our approved product or any other product candidate for which we may obtain approval. We do not expect additional revenue from our other product candidates unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our other product candidates, and we do not know when, or if, this will occur.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales consists primarily of third-party manufacturing costs, distribution, and overhead costs related to ANKTIVA sales. Cost of sales may also include costs related to excess or obsolete inventory adjustment charges, abnormal costs, unabsorbed manufacturing and overhead costs, and manufacturing variances. All costs associated with the production of ANKTIVA prior to receiving regulatory approval were expensed in 
research and development expense
, on the consolidated statement of operations in the period incurred and therefore are not reflected in cost of sales. We expect the cost of sales for ANKTIVA to increase in relation to product revenues as we deplete these inventories.
Operating Expenses
We generally classify our operating expenses into research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs, including salaries, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation expense comprise a significant component of our research and development, and selling, general and administrative expense categories. We allocate expenses associated with our facilities and information technology costs between these two categories, primarily based on the nature of each cost.
Research and Development
Research and development expense consists of expenses incurred while performing research and development activities to discover and develop our technology and product candidates. This includes conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, manufacturing development efforts, and activities related to regulatory submissions for our approved product and product candidates. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred. 
Our research and development expenses primarily consist of:
•
clinical trial and regulatory-related costs;
•
expenses incurred under agreements with investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials;
•
expenses incurred under collaborative agreements;
135
Table of Conten
t
s
•
manufacturing and testing costs and related supplies and materials;
•
employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation; and
•
facility expenses dedicated to research and development.
The company classifies its research and development expenses as either external or internal. The company’s external research and development expenses support its various preclinical and clinical programs. The company’s internal research and development expenses include payroll and benefits expenses, facilities and equipment expense, and other indirect research and development expenses incurred in support of its research and development activities. The company’s external and internal resources are not directly tied to any one research or drug discovery program and are typically deployed across multiple programs and are not allocated to specific product candidates or development programs. 
We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to expanding our product into new indications and markets, developing our other product candidates, and conducting our ongoing and planned clinical trials
.

The process of conducting clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming. The successful development of product candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing or costs required to complete the remaining development of our other product candidates or to expand potential approved markets and indications for ANKTIVA. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of product candidates.
The costs of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project owing to, but not limited to, the following:
•
per patient trial costs;
•
the number of sites included in the clinical trials;
•
the countries in which the clinical trials are conducted;
•
the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
•
the number of patients that participate in the clinical trials;
•
the number of doses that patients receive;
•
the cost of comparative or combination agents used in clinical trials;
•
the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;
•
potential additional safety monitoring or other studies or incremental cohorts requested by regulatory agencies;
•
the duration of patient follow-up; and
•
the safety profile and efficacy of the product candidate.
We have only one approved product, ANKTIVA, for which we received approval from the FDA on 
April 22, 2024. We began commercial distribution of our approved product in May 2024. There can be no assurance that our other product candidates will be approved for commercial sale by the FDA in the near term, if ever. 
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and personnel-related costs, including employee benefits and any stock-based compensation, for employees performing functions other than research and development. This includes personnel in executive, finance, human resources, information technology, legal, sales and administrative support functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include sales and marketing costs, facility-related costs not otherwise allocated to research and development expense, professional fees for auditing, tax and legal services, advertising costs, expenses associated with strategic business transactions and business development efforts, obtaining and maintaining patents, consulting costs, royalties and licensing costs, and costs of our information systems.
136
Table of Conten
t
s
We expect that our selling, general and administrative expense will increase for the foreseeable future as we commercialize our approved product and expand operations, build out information systems and increase our headcount to support continued research activities and the development of our clinical programs. We have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur in the future, additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including costs to comply with stock exchange listing and SEC requirements, future funding efforts, corporate governance, internal controls, investor relations, disclosure and similar requirements applicable to public companies. Additionally, if and when we believe that a regulatory approval of one of our other product candidates appears likely, we expect to incur significant increases in our selling, general and administrative expense relating to the sales and marketing of any additional approved product candidate.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest and investment income (loss), interest expense (including amortization of debt discounts), unrealized gains and losses from investments in equity securities and equity-method investments, changes in fair value of warrant liabilities, derivative liabilities, and convertible notes, realized gains and losses on debt and equity securities, and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions.
Income Taxes
We are subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as income tax in Italy, South Korea, California and other states. From inception through December 31, 2024, we have not been required to pay U.S. federal and state income taxes because of current and accumulated NOLs.

Product Revenue, Net
Product revenue, net increased $14.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was driven by sales of ANKTIVA after FDA approval in April 2024. 
Other Revenues
Other revenues are consistent during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

Cost of Sales
We did not report cost of sales during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Cost of sales consists primarily of third-party manufacturing, distribution and overhead costs. All costs associated with the production of ANKTIVA prior to receiving regulatory approval were expensed in 
research and development expense
, on the consolidated statement of operations in the period incurred and therefore are not reflected in cost of sales. As a result, our initial product gross margin is higher as our pre-launch inventory costs are not included in the cost of sales. We expect the cost of sales for ANKTIVA to increase in relation to product revenues as we deplete these inventories. 
Research and Development Expense
Research and development expense decreased $42.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, together with the changes in those items (in thousands):

Research and development expense decreased $42.2 million primarily attributable to the following:
•
a $37.9 million decrease in external research and development expenses that was primarily due to a reduction in CMO fees and testing services, a reduction in clinical trial costs, and a reduction in outside service costs;
•
a $1.8 million increase in personnel-related costs that was primarily due to an increase in salary and benefits expenses from the expansion of the regulatory and sales teams during the year ended December 31, 2024, a reversal in 2023 of the 2022 accrued discretionary bonuses and a reduction in headcount during the year ended December 31, 2023, partially offset by an increase in shared service costs charged out and a decrease in stock-based compensation costs due to the prior years’ retention awards fully vesting during the year ended December 31, 2024; 
•
a $0.4 million increase in equipment, depreciation, and facility costs that was primarily due to increases in software purchases, facility expenses and common area maintenance costs, partially offset by decreases in depreciation and amortization expenses and lease expenses; and 
•
a $6.5 million decrease in other research and development costs, primarily attributable to lower material supply costs due to decreased production activities, a reclass of overhead costs to capitalized inventory and lower research agreement expenses, partially offset by an increase from no costs allocated to a joint venture and an increase in drug costs.
We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development activities related to developing our product candidates and conduct our ongoing and planned clinical trials.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense
Selling, general and administrative expense increased $39.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The rise in expenses was primarily due to a $19.8 million increase in legal expenses driven by higher defense and settlement costs and increased general legal services, a $14.6 million increase in consulting fees 
primarily associated with commercial readiness activities, an 
$8.3 million
 increase in salary and benefits 
primarily from the reversal in 2023 of the 2022 accrued discretionary bonuses, and a reduction in headcount during the year ended December 31, 2023, a $2.2 million increase in other operating costs due to post commercialization marketing activities, a $1.3 million increase in license fees, a $1.1 million increase in audit and tax fees, a $0.9 million increase in recruiting and training costs and a $0.4 million increase in travel expenses, partially offset by a $9.4 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense. 
Impairment of Intangible Assets
Impairment of intangible assets decreased $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The $0.9 million impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2023 was related to indefinite-lived intangible assets associated with the Tarmogen platform as the research and development program was limited. There was no impairment of intangible assets incurred during the year ended December 31, 2024. 
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net decreased $152.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The reduction in other income (expense), net was primarily due to a change of $79.7 million in fair value of convertible notes driven by the revaluation gain of $43.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the $36.2 million loss during the year ended December 31, 2023, a change of $67.6 million due to the reduction of fair value of warrant liabilities, a decrease of $14.3 million in i
nterest expense (including amounts with related parties), 
a change of $13.5 million in the fair value of derivative liabilities, 
a decrease of 
$7.5 million
 due to loss on equity method investments recorded during 
the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $6.8 million in interest and investment income, net and a decrease of $2.2 million in other income (expense), net (including amounts with related parties), partially offset by an increase of $39.4 million in interest expense related to the revenue interest liability.

“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations”

of our Annual Report filed with the SEC on March 19, 2024 for a discussion of the company’s results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Liquidity
From inception through December 31, 2024, we have funded our operations primarily through proceeds from the issuance of related-party promissory notes, sales of common stock under our shelf registration statements and through RDOs, and a RIPA financing. 
Cash and Marketable Securities on Hand
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $149.8 million compared to $267.4 million as of December 31, 2023. We have typically invested our cash in a variety of financial instruments and classified these investments as available-for-sale. However, after our entry into the RIPA we can no longer invest our excess funds in corporate or European bonds. Certain of our investments are subject to credit, liquidity, market, and interest-rate risks. The general condition of the financial markets and the economy may increase those risks and may affect the value and liquidity of investments and restrict our ability to access the capital markets. 
140
Table of Conten

s
Shelf Registration Statements
During 2023, we filed a $750.0 million shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 for the offering and sale of equity and equity-linked securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depositary shares, warrants to purchase common stock, preferred stock or debt securities, subscription rights, purchase contracts, and units. As of December 31, 2024, we had $565.6 million available for use under this shelf. 
In April 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3ASR pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell an indeterminate amount of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depositary shares, warrants, subscription rights, purchase contracts, or units, and an associated prospectus related to the ATM.
Exercise of Warrants
Pursuant to warrant agreements issued in connection with our RDOs, we issued warrants to institutional holders. During the year ended December 31, 2024, institutional holders exercised a total of 22,242,740 warrants pursuant to the warrant agreements at an exercise price of $3.2946 per share resulting in the issuance of 22,242,740 shares of the company’s common stock for proceeds totaling $73.3 million. As of December 31, 2024, a total of 6,399,171 warrants remain outstanding with an exercise price of $3.2946 per share and an expiration date of July 24, 2026.
Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement
On December 29, 2023, we entered into the RIPA with Infinity and Oberland. Pursuant to the RIPA, Oberland had the option to purchase additional Revenue Interests from us in exchange for a $100.0 million Second Payment upon satisfaction of certain conditions in the RIPA, including receipt of approval from the FDA of our BLA for ANKTIVA on or before June 30, 2024. On April 22, 2024, the FDA approved our product ANKTIVA and as a result, on May 13, 2024 Oberland purchased additional Revenue Interests from us for a gross purchase price of $100.0 million, less certain issuance costs. 
As consideration for the aforementioned payments, Oberland has the right to receive quarterly Revenue Interest Payments from us based on, among other things, a certain percentage of our net sales during such quarter, which are tiered payments ranging from 4.5% to 10.0% (before funding of the Second Payment, 3.0% to 7.0%) of the company’s worldwide net sales, excluding those in China. See 
Note 11

Conversion of Related-Party Promissory Notes
On December 10, 2024 in connection with an equity offering, the company received written notices from Nant Capital, the holder of the $30.0 million promissory note due December 31, 2025 and the $200.0 million promissory note due September 11, 2026, of its election to convert the entire outstanding principal and accrued interest due under the existing notes into shares of the company’s common stock. As of such date, the total outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest due under the existing notes of approximately $30.7 million was converted into 13,475,172 shares of the company’s common stock at a price of $2.28 per share (for the $30.0 million note) and approximately $200.7 million was converted into 103,710,088 shares of the company’s common stock at a price of $1.9350 per share (for the $200.0 million note) in accordance with the terms of the existing promissory notes.

Stock Purchase and Option Agreement
On December 29, 2023 and in connection with the RIPA, we entered into an SPOA with Oberland. Under this agreement, Oberland had an option to purchase up to $10.0 million of our common stock, at a price per share to be determined by reference to the 30-day trailing volume weighted-average price of our common stock, calculated from the date of exercise. The option is exercisable by Oberland at any time until the earliest of (i) December 29, 2028, (ii) a change of control of the company, or (iii) a sale of substantially all of the company’s assets. Among other limitations, the option may only be exercised to the extent that the common stock issuable pursuant to such exercise would not exceed 19.9% of the common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise.

s
Pursuant to the SPOA, in April 2024 Oberland exercised its option to purchase 858,990 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $5.8208 per share generating net proceeds of approximately $4.9 million. In relation to this transaction, we recorded $7.6 million in 
additional paid-in capital,
 on the statement of stockholders’ deficit during the year ended December 31, 2024. Following such exercise, approximately $5.0 million remains available for future exercise under the SPOA as of December 31, 2024. 
Uses of Liquidity
In addition to the cash used to fund our operating activities discussed in “
—Future Funding Requirements
” below, we will require cash to settle the following obligations:
•
As of December 31, 2024, our indebtedness payable at maturity is $505.0 million. This convertible promissory note is held by Nant Capital, an entity affiliated with Dr. Soon-Shiong. In connection with the RIPA, our related-party promissory note is a general unsecured obligation of the company that is subordinated in right of payment to indebtedness, obligations, and other liabilities under the RIPA, the Revenue Interests issued pursuant to such agreement, and refinancing of the foregoing. 
There can be no assurance that the company can refinance this promissory note or what terms will be available in the market at the time of refinancing. Furthermore, if prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to the refinanced indebtedness would increase. These risks could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.
•
On 
December 29, 2023
, we entered into the RIPA with Infinity and Oberland. Oberland has the right to receive quarterly Revenue Interest Payments from us based on, among other things, our worldwide net sales, excluding those in China, which will be tiered payments initially ranging from 
4.5% to 10.0% (before funding of the Second Payment, 3.0% to 7.0%)
, subject to increase or decrease, following 
December 31, 2029
 (the Test Date) 
depending on 
whether our aggregate payments made to Oberland as of the Test Date have met or exceeded the Cumulative Purchaser Payments. In addition, if our aggregate payments made as of the Test Date to Oberland do not equal or exceed the amount of the Cumulative Purchaser Payments as of such date, then we are obligated to make a one-time True-Up Payment to Oberland in an amount equal to 100% of the Cumulative Purchaser Payments as of the Test Date, less the aggregate amount of our previous payments to Oberland as of the Test Date.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in operating activities of $366.8 million consisted of a net loss of $583.9 million, partially offset by $213.1 million in adjustments for non-cash items and $4.0 million of cash provided by net working capital. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $49.2 million in stock-based compensation expense, $47.6 million in change in fair value of warrant liabilities, $42.4 million in amortization of debt issuance costs and accretion of discounts, $36.2 million in change in fair value of convertible notes, $18.5 million in depreciation and amortization expense, $8.9 million in non-cash interest primarily related to related-party promissory notes, $6.1 million in non-cash lease expense related to operating lease right‑of‑use assets, $2.0 million of transaction costs allocable to warrant liabilities, $1.6 million in unrealized losses on equity securities driven by a decrease in the value of our investments, $0.9 million in loss on impairment of intangible assets, and $0.3 million of non-cash interest expense related to the revenue interest liability, partially offset by $0.5 million in other items and a decrease of $0.1 million in amortization of premiums, net of discounts on marketable debt securities. The changes in net working capital consisted primarily of an increase of $6.7 million in accrued expenses, a decrease of $6.0 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a decrease of $1.9 million in other assets, partially offset by a decrease of $6.5 million in accounts payable, a decrease of $3.0 million in operating lease liabilities, and a decrease of $1.1 million in due to related parties.
We have historically experienced negative cash flows from operating activities, with such negative cash flows likely to continue for the foreseeable future.

Investing Activities
During the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was $12.2 million, which included cash outflows of $140.2 million for purchases of marketable debt securities, $6.9 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment, $1.0 million used for the acquisition of a business, net of transaction costs, and $0.7 million cash paid for other investments, partially offset by proceeds of $136.6 million from maturities and sales of marketable debt and equity securities. 
During the year ended December 31, 2023, net cash used in investing activities was $30.5 million, which included cash outflows of $30.6 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment (including construction in progress and the completion of a warehouse facility), and $10.4 million in purchases of marketable debt securities, partially offset by cash inflows of $10.5 million from maturities and sales of marketable debt and equity securities. 
Our investments in property, plant and equipment are primarily related to acquisitions of equipment that will be used for the manufacturing of our approved product and product candidates and expenditures related to the buildout of our manufacturing facilities. We expect to accelerate our capital spending as we scale our GMP manufacturing capabilities, which will require significant capital for the foreseeable future.

Future Funding Requirements
Prior to the approval of ANKTIVA for commercial sale, we primarily generated revenues from non-exclusive license agreements related to our cell lines, the sale of our bioreactors and related consumables, and grant programs. The company expects to continue to generate revenue from these programs. 
Until April 2024, we had no clinical products approved for commercial sale and thus had not generated any revenue from therapeutic and vaccine product candidates that are or were under development. Now that we have received FDA approval for ANKTIVA, we have begun to generate revenue although we expect it to take some time to generate significant revenue from our approved product and we can provide no assurance when, or if, this will occur. We began commercial distribution of our approved product in May 2024; however, we can provide no assurance with respect to our future revenues, market acceptance, reimbursement from third-party payors, or the profitability of our approved product or any other product candidate for which we may obtain approval. We do not expect additional revenue from our other product candidates unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize any of our other product candidates, and we do not know when, or if, this will occur. In addition, we expect our operating expenses to significantly increase in connection with our ongoing development activities, 
144
Table of Conten
t
s
particularly as we continue the research, development and clinical trials of, and seek regulatory approval for, our other product candidates. We have also incurred and expect that we will continue to incur in the future additional costs associated with operating as a public company as well as costs related to future fundraising efforts. In addition, subject to obtaining regulatory approval of our other product candidates, we expect to incur significant incremental commercialization expenses for product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We anticipate that we will need substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. 
We expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially if and as we:
•
commercialize our approved product;
•
continue research and development, including preclinical and clinical development of our other existing product candidates;
•
seek regulatory approval of our approved product in incremental markets and indications and potentially seek regulatory approval for our other product candidates;
•
seek to discover and develop additional product candidates;
•
establish a commercialization infrastructure and scale up our manufacturing and distribution capabilities to commercialize any of our other product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval;
•
seek to comply with regulatory standards and laws;
•
maintain, leverage and expand our intellectual property portfolio;
•
hire clinical, manufacturing, scientific and other personnel to support our product candidates’ development and future commercialization efforts;
•
add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel; and
•
incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company.
As a result of continuing anticipated operating cash outflows as we commercialize our approved product and accelerate our development efforts, we believe that substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to continue as a going concern without additional funding or financial support. However, we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, and investments in marketable securities; sales of our approved product; capital to be raised through equity offerings, including but not limited to, the offering, issuance and sale by us of our common stock under the February 2023 shelf registration statement, of which we had $565.6 million available for future offerings as of December 31, 2024; and our potential ability to borrow from affiliated entities will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next 12 months following the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements based primarily upon our Founder, Executive Chairman and Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer’s intent and ability to support our operations with additional funds, including loans from affiliated entities, as required, which we believe alleviates such doubt. In addition to funds from the future sales of our approved product, which we expect to take time to establish, we may also seek to sell additional equity, through one or more follow-on public offerings, or in separate financings, or obtain a credit facility, issue other debt in compliance with the terms of the RIPA, or engage in strategic partnership transactions. However, we may not be able to secure such external financing in a timely manner or on favorable terms, if at all. Without additional funds, we may choose to delay or reduce our operating or investment expenditures. Further, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we may need additional funds to meet our needs sooner than planned.
We will need to obtain additional financing to fund our future operations, including completing the commercialization of our approved product and the development and commercialization of our other product candidates. Changing circumstances may cause us to increase our spending significantly faster than we currently anticipate and we may need to raise additional funds sooner than we presently anticipate. Moreover, research and development and our operating costs and fixed expenses such as rent and other contractual commitments, including those for our research collaborations, are substantial and are expected to increase in the future.
145
Table of Conten
t
s
Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:
•
our ability and the time required to successfully commercialize our approved product;
•
progress, timing, number, scope and costs of researching and developing our product candidates and our ongoing, planned and potential clinical trials;
•
time and cost of regulatory approvals;
•
our ability to successfully commercialize any of our other product candidates, if approved and the costs of such commercialization activities; 
•
revenue from product candidates that we may commercialize, if any, including the selling prices for such potential products and the availability of adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement for patients;
•
interest and principal payments on our related-party promissory note, and repayment of Revenue Interests and Test Date payments due under the RIPA;
•
cost of building, staffing and validating our own manufacturing facilities in the U.S., including having a product candidate successfully manufactured consistent with FDA and EMA regulations;
•
terms, timing and costs of our current and any potential future collaborations, business or product acquisitions, CVRs, milestones, royalties, licensing or other arrangements that we have established or may establish;
•
time and cost necessary to respond to technological, regulatory, political and market developments; and 
•
costs of filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights.
Unless and until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenues, we may finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, license agreements, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing or distribution arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms, or at all.
To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or equity-linked securities (including warrants), convertible debt or through our shelf registration statements, or other offerings, or if any of our current debt is converted into equity or if our existing warrants are exercised, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. The incurrence of additional indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could involve certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms unfavorable to us and our revenue interest liability may come due. We have no committed source of additional capital and if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to delay or reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts. Our current license and collaboration agreements may also be terminated if we are unable to meet the payment obligations under those agreements. As a result, we may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time.
Contractual Obligations
We have material cash requirements to pay related-party affiliates and third parties under various contractual obligations discussed below:
•
We are obligated to make payments to several related-party affiliates under written agreements and other informal arrangements. We are also obligated to pay interest and to repay principal under our related-party promissory note. See

We are obligated to make payments to Oberland associated with our revenue interest liability, which do not have a fixed repayment schedule. Oberland’s right to receive payments under the RIPA shall terminate when Oberland has received maximum payments (including any True-Up Payment) equal to 195.0% of the then Cumulative Purchaser Payments unless the RIPA is terminated prior to such date. 
Under the terms of the agreement, prior to the Test Date, every $100.0 million of worldwide net sales, excluding those in China, of less than or equal to $600.0 million in a calendar year will result in a tiered Revenue Interest Payment of approximately $10.0 million or 10.0% (after funding of the Second Payment). Worldwide net sales, excluding those in China, for a calendar year exceeding $600.0 million will result in a tiered Revenue Interest Payment of approximately $4.5 million or 4.5% (after funding of the Second Payment) for every $100.0 million of worldwide net sales, excluding those in China, above the threshold. 
In the future, cumulative worldwide net sales, excluding those in China, levels up to the Test Date will determine whether or not we are required to make a True-Up Payment and implement modified payment rates. The amount of the obligation and timing of payment is likely to change

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Those estimates can be complex and actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information. 
While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements that appear in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report, we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements:
Revenue Recognition
Product Revenue, Net 
After FDA approval in April 2024, the company began recognizing revenue from the sale of ANKTIVA in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (ASC 606). The provisions of ASC 606 require the following steps to determine revenue recognition: (i) identification of contract with the customers; (ii) identification of performance obligations; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations based on estimated selling prices; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract, determine whether each promised good or service is distinct and identify those that are performance obligations. We recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. 
The company entered into a third-party logistics agreement to engage a 3PL Agent to distribute the company’s products to its customers. The 3PL Agent provides services to the company that include storage, shipping and distribution, processing product returns, as well as customer service, order to cash, and logistics support. The company’s customers are currently limited to pharmaceutical specialty distributors and specialty pharmacy. The company primarily sells ANKTIVA to specialty distributors through a drop-ship arrangement under which orders from various healthcare institutions such as hospitals, medical facilities, physician practices, pharmacies and government agencies are processed through and controlled by specialty distributors. Under the drop-ship arrangement, the 3PL Agent ships the product to various health care institutions without the specialty distributor ever taking physical possession of the product. The company recognizes product revenue when ANKTIVA is delivered to the destination as instructed and controlled by specialty distributors. 
The company also sells ANKTIVA directly to a specialty pharmacy who then subsequently distributes ANKTIVA to physicians, clinics, and certain medical centers, hospitals or other healthcare institutions. The company recognizes product revenue when ANKTIVA is delivered to the specialty pharmacy location.
Product revenue is recorded with each sale at wholesale acquisition cost, net of: (a) consideration payable to customers; and (b) variable considerations. The company pays fees to the specialty distributors for certain administrative services associated with the distribution of the product wherein the terms of which are also detailed in its contracts. Such fees are not for a distinct good or service and, accordingly, are recorded as a reduction of revenue, as well as a reduction of accounts receivable (trade discounts) or as a component of accrued expenses (distributor fees). The variable consideration components include, but are not limited to, prompt payment discounts, product returns, chargebacks, rebates, and co-payment assistance, which are collectively referred to as “Gross-to-Net Adjustments.” In accordance with ASC 606, the company must make significant judgments to determine the estimates for certain variable considerations. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The company utilizes the expected value method when estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price with respect to each of the foregoing variable consideration components. Where appropriate, these estimates are based on factors such as industry and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns, our experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, and specific known market events and trends. 
148
Table of Conten
t
s
Variable considerations are reassessed each reporting period, and adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which affects product revenue and net income in the period of adjustment. The actual amounts of variable consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in future periods vary from our estimates, we adjust these estimates accordingly. As we gain more experience, estimates will be more heavily based on the expected utilization from historical data we have accumulated since the ANKTIVA product launch. The consideration payable to customers and contingent considerations reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contracts.
Other Revenues
Prior to the approval of ANKTIVA for commercial sale, we primarily generated revenues from non-exclusive license agreements related to our cell lines, the sale of our bioreactors and related consumables, and grant programs. The company expects to continue to generate revenue from these programs.
We sell our proprietary GMP-in-a-Box bioreactors and related consumables to affiliated companies and third parties. The arrangements typically include delivery of bioreactors, consumables, and providing installation service and perpetual software licenses for using the equipment. We recognize revenue when customers obtain control and can benefit from the promised goods or services, generally upon installation of the bioreactors, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Upfront payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and recognized as revenue when we satisfy our performance obligations under these arrangements.
Grant revenue is typically paid for reimbursable costs incurred over the duration of the associated research project or clinical trial and is recognized either when expenses reimbursable under the grants have been incurred and payments under the grants become contractually due or when cash is received, depending on the certainty of payment and other factors specific to each grant. 
License Agreements with Third Parties
The company has nonexclusive license agreements with a limited number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that grant them the right to use our cell lines and intellectual property for non-clinical use. These agreements generally include upfront fees and annual research license fees for such use, as well as commercial license fees for sales of the licensee products developed or manufactured using our intellectual property and cell lines. 
Under our license agreements with customers, we typically promise to provide a license to use certain cell lines and related patents, the related know-how, and future research and development data that affect the license. We have concluded that these promises represent a single performance obligation due to the highly interrelated nature of the promises. We provide the cell lines and know-how immediately upon entering into the contracts. Research and development data are provided throughout the term of the contract when and if available. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. 
Our license agreements may include non-refundable upfront payments, event-based milestone payments, sales-based royalty payments, or some combination of these. The event-based milestone payments represent variable consideration, and we use the most likely amount method to estimate this variable consideration. Given the high degree of uncertainty around the achievement of these milestones, we do not recognize revenue from these milestone payments until the uncertainty associated with these payments is resolved. We currently estimate variable consideration related to milestone payments to be zero and, as such, no revenue has been recognized for milestone payments. We recognize revenue from sales-based royalty payments when or as sales occur. On a quarterly basis, we re-evaluate our estimate of milestone variable consideration to determine whether any amount should be included in the transaction price and recorded in revenue prospectively.
Inventories
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and consists of raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods. Cost is determined using a standard cost method, which approximates actual cost, and assumes a FIFO flow of goods. Inventory that is used for clinical development purposes is expensed in 
research and development expense
, on the consolidated statement of operations when consumed.
149
Table of Conten
t
s
Cost of sales consists primarily of third-party manufacturing costs, distribution, and overhead costs related to sales of approved product subsequent to receiving regulatory approval. Cost of sales may also include costs related to excess or obsolete inventory adjustment charges, abnormal costs, unabsorbed manufacturing and overhead costs, and manufacturing variances. All costs associated with the production of ANKTIVA prior to receiving regulatory approval were expensed in 
research and development expense
, on the consolidated statement of operations in the period incurred and therefore are not reflected in cost of sales. 
The work-in-progress materials consists of bulk drug substance and drug product, which have a multi-year shelf life. When the bulk drug substance is manufactured into ANKTIVA drug product, those goods have a shelf life of two years from the date of manufacture. During September 2024, the shelf life of ANKTIVA drug product was extended to three years. The work-in-progress drug product gets converted to finished goods at the time of labeling. Our expectation is to sell finished goods at least twelve months prior to expiration. Due to our long manufacturing lead time, it was necessary to build up inventory in support of ANKTIVA forecasted sales. As a result of being in the early stages of the ANKTIVA product launch, the company is continuing to evaluate the length of its operating cycle.
On a quarterly basis, the company analyzes its inventory levels for excess quantities and obsolescence (expiration), taking into account factors such as historical and anticipated future sales compared to quantities on hand and the remaining shelf life. As of December 31, 2024, we determined that a reserve related to ANKTIVA inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence was not required. In addition, since the FDA approval of ANKTIVA the company has not recorded any inventory write downs.
Revenue Interest Liability
On December 29, 2023, we entered into the RIPA with Infinity and Oberland. Pursuant to the RIPA, Oberland acquired certain Revenue Interests from us for a gross purchase price of $200.0 million paid on closing. In addition, Oberland may purchase additional Revenue Interests from us in exchange for the $100.0 million Second Payment upon satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the RIPA. Under the RIPA, Oberland has the right to receive quarterly payments from us based on, among other things, a certain percentage of our worldwide net sales, excluding those in China, during such quarter. The RIPA is considered a sale of future revenues and is accounted for as a liability net of a debt discount comprised of deferred issuance costs, the fair value of a freestanding option agreement related to the SPOA, and the fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation on the consolidated balance sheet. The company imputes interest expense associated with this liability using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is calculated based on the rate that would enable the debt to be repaid in full over the anticipated life of the arrangement. Interest expense is recognized over the estimated term on the consolidated statement of operations. The interest rate on this liability may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors, including the level of actual and forecasted net sales. The company evaluates the interest rate quarterly based on actual and forecasted net sales utilizing the prospective method. A significant increase or decrease in actual or forecasted net sales will materially impact the revenue interest liability, interest expense, and the time period for repayment.
Derivative Liabilities
Embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from the underlying debt instrument that do not meet the derivative scope exception and equity classification criteria are accounted for and valued as separate financial instruments. The terms of an embedded derivative related to a contingent exercisable prepayment feature of a convertible note have been evaluated and deemed to require bifurcation. This embedded derivative was initially measured at fair value and is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the derivative is settled. On December 10, 2024, the company and Nant Capital entered into a second amended and restated promissory note (the $505.0 million December 2024 Promissory Note) for which the FVO method of accounting was elected. As such, the bifurcation of the embedded derivative is not required. The embedded derivative is now included within the fair value of the second amended and restated promissory note recorded in 
related-party convertible note payable at fair value
, on the consolidated balance sheet. 
In addition, the RIPA contains certain features that meet the definition of being an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation as a separate compound financial instrument apart from the RIPA. The derivative liability is initially measured at fair value upon issuance and is subject to remeasurement at each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in 
other income (expense), net
, on the consolidated statement of operations.

Research and Development Costs
Major components of research and development costs include cash compensation and other personnel-related expenses, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense on research and development property and equipment and intangible assets, costs of preclinical studies, clinical trials costs, including CROs and related clinical manufacturing, including third-party CMOs, costs of drug development, costs of materials and supplies, facilities cost, overhead costs, regulatory and compliance costs, and fees paid to consultants and other entities that conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf. Costs incurred in research and development are expensed as incurred.
The company classifies its research and development expenses as either external or internal. The company’s external research and development expenses support its various preclinical and clinical programs. The company’s internal research and development expenses include payroll and benefits expenses, facilities and equipment expense, and other indirect research and development expenses incurred in support of its research and development activities. The company’s external and internal resources are not directly tied to any one research or drug discovery program and are typically deployed across multiple programs and are not allocated to specific product candidates or development programs.
Included in research and development costs are clinical trial and research expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions and clinical research organizations and other vendors that conduct clinical trials and research on our behalf. We record accruals for estimated costs under these contracts. When evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities, we analyze the progress of the preclinical studies or clinical trials, including the phase or completion of events, invoices received, contracted costs and purchase orders. Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period based on the facts and circumstances known at that time. Although we do not expect the estimates to be materially different from the amounts actually incurred, if the estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. Actual results could differ from our estimates. We adjust the accruals in the period when actual costs become known.

We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue for the best estimate of a loss within a range; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount in the range. If we determine that a material loss is reasonably possible, we disclose the possible loss or range of loss, or that the amount of loss cannot be estimated at this time. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause a change in the potential amount of the liability recorded or the range of potential losses disclosed. Moreover, we record gain contingencies only when they are realizable and the amount is known. Additionally, we record our rights to insurance recoveries, limited to the extent of incurred or probable losses, as a receivable when such recoveries have been agreed to with our third-party insurers and when receipt is deemed probable. This includes instances when our third-party insurers have agreed to pay, on our behalf, certain legal defense costs and settlement amounts directly to applicable law firms and a settlement fund.
Warrants
The company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in FASB ASC Topic 480, 
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity 
(ASC 480), and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the company’s own stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.
For warrants that meet all criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of 
additional paid-in capital, 
on the consolidated statement of stockholders’ deficit at the time of issuance. For warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and on each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss in 
other income (expense), net
, on the consolidated statement of operations. The fair value of the warrants was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

Fair Value Option Election
The company elected to apply the FVO method of accounting in line with ASC 825 and account for certain of its notes and embedded derivatives at fair value as a single instrument in accordance with ASC 815. The notes for which the FVO is elected are recorded at fair value upon the date of issuance and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of the notes accounted for at fair value are recorded as a component of 
other income (expense), net, 
on the consolidated statement of operations. Any changes in fair value caused by instrument-specific credit risk are recorded separately in 
other comprehensive income (loss), 
on the consolidated statement of comprehensive loss. The cumulative amount previously recorded in 
other comprehensive income (loss)
 resulting from changes in the instrument-specific credit risk for extinguished notes are reclassified and reported in current earnings on the consolidated statement of operations. All costs associated with the issuance of the convertible promissory note accounted for using the FVO were expensed upon issuance.
The company has applied the FVO on the $505.0 million December 2024 Promissory Note and $30.0 million March 2023 Promissory Note prior to its extinguishment on December 29, 2023. See 
Note

12

“Related-Party Debt”
 for more information. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the company recorded $1.2 million changes in fair value related to instrument-specific credit risk.

Debt Modification and Extinguishment
The company evaluates amendments to its debt instruments in accordance with ASC 470-50. This evaluation includes comparing (1) if applicable, the net present value of future cash flows of the amended debt to that of the original debt and (2) the change in fair value of an embedded conversion feature to that of the carrying amount of the debt immediately prior to amendment to determine, in each case, if a change greater than 10% occurred. In instances where the net present value of future cash flows or the fair value of an embedded conversion feature, if any, changed more than 10%, the company applies extinguishment accounting. In instances where the net present value of future cash flows and the fair value of an embedded conversion feature, if any, changed less than 10%, the company accounts for the amendment to the debt as a debt modification. Gains and losses on debt amendments that are considered extinguishments are recognized in current earnings or in additional paid-in capital if the transactions are with entities under common control. Debt amendments that are considered debt modifications are accounted for prospectively through yield adjustments, based on the revised terms. The increase in fair value of the embedded conversion feature from the debt modification was accounted for as an increase in debt discount with a corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital. Legal fees and other costs incurred with third parties that are directly related to debt modifications are expensed as incurred. Amounts paid by the company to the lenders, are reflected as additional debt discount and amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over remaining term of modified debt using the effective interest rate method.
Provision for Income Taxes
Our provision for income taxes is computed under the asset and liability method. Significant estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes. Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts (temporary differences) at enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets, including net operating losses and tax credits, will not be realized. We periodically re-assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based on various factors including our historical earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction, and forecasts of future operating results and utilization of net operating losses and tax credits prior to their expiration. Significant judgment is required in making this assessment and, to the extent that a reversal of any portion of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is deemed appropriate, a tax benefit will be recognized against our provision for income taxes in the period of such reversal.

Stock-Based Compensation
We account for stock-based compensation under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718, 
Compensation—Stock Compensation
 (ASC 718). We estimate fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions, including, but not limited to, expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and the expected term of the stock options. We measure the fair value of an equity-classified award at the grant date and recognize the stock-based compensation expense over the period of vesting on the straight-line basis for our outstanding share awards that do not contain a performance condition. For awards subject to performance-based vesting conditions, we assess the probability of the individual milestones under the award being achieved and stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the service period using the graded vesting method once management believes the performance criteria is probable of being met. For awards with service or performance conditions, we recognize the effect of forfeitures in compensation cost in the period that the award was forfeited.

Other Company Information
Transition from Smaller Reporting Company Status
On December 31, 2024, we ceased to be a “smaller reporting company” because the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of June 28, 2024. However, we are complying with certain scaled disclosure requirements available to smaller reporting companies in this Annual Report (including as incorporated by reference to the information contained in our Proxy Statement), which we are permitted to do under SEC rules because we were a smaller reporting company in 2024. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than what you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned on our cash equivalents, investments and variable interest rate debt. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations. A secondary objective is to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk. Our investment policy provides for investments in low-risk, investment-grade debt instruments. As of December 31, 2024, we had $143.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.4 million in our investment portfolio. Our cash equivalents are short-term investments with maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. We maintain cash deposits in FDIC insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. However, we believe that we are not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which those deposits are held. As of December 31, 2024, our investment portfolio was comprised of available-for-sale securities, and we did not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. 
Interest Rate Risk – Cash
With the cash discussed above, our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S interest rates. However, we do not believe a sudden change in the interest rates would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations due to the short-term maturities of our cash equivalents. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Interest Rate Risk – Cash Equivalents and Investment Portfolio
We invest a portion of our cash in a number of diversified fixed-and floating-rate securities, consisting of marketable debt securities and debt funds that are subject to interest rate risk. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect the fair value of our investment portfolio. If interest rates in the general economy were to rise, our holdings could lose value. At December 31, 2024, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across the entire yield curve on our holdings would not have resulted in a material impact on the fair value of our portfolio.
Interest Rate Risk – Variable-Rate Debt
Our use of variable-rate debt exposes us to interest rate risk as changes in interest rates would affect interest expense. As of 
December 31, 2024
, we have a $505.0 million variable-rate loan outstanding, which matures on December 31, 2027 and bears interest at Term SOFR plus 8.0% per annum.
As of 
December 31, 2024
, the weighted-average interest rate on this loan was 12.34%. A 
hy
pothetical 100-basis point increase in the Term SOFR rate as of December 31, 2024 would increase our future interest payments by $15.2 million. Similarly, a hypothetical 100-basis point decrease in the Term SOFR rate as of December 31, 2024 would decrease our future interest payments by $15.2 million.
Interest Rate Risk – RIPA
We have entered into a revenue interest purchase agreement. Our primary exposure to market risk is that the interest rate on the revenue interest liability may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors, including the level of forecasted net sales. A significant increase or decrease in actual or forecasted net sales will materially impact the revenue interest liability, interest expense, and the time period for repayment. See 
Note 11

“Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement”
 that appears in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report for more information regarding the terms of the RIPA.
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in conducting business globally in numerous currencies. We contract with clinical research organizations, investigational sites and suppliers in foreign countries. 
We are, therefore, subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates in connection with these agreements. We have not entered into any material foreign currency hedging contracts although we may do so in the future. From inception through the date of this Annual Report, we have not incurred any material effects from foreign currency changes on these contracts. The effect of a 
10% adverse change in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated cash and payables as of December 31, 2024 
would not have been material
. However, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future.
154
Table of Conten
t
s
We are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations related to the operations of our subsidiary in Italy whose financial statements are denominated in the Euro. We translate all assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate as of the end of the reporting period, while the operating results are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates for the reporting periods. Gains and losses resulting from translating the financial statements from our subsidiary’s functional currency to U.S. dollars are recognized as a component of 
other comprehensive (loss) income
, on the consolidated statement of comprehensive loss. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations affect our reported net loss and can make comparisons from period to period more difficult. Our foreign operations are not material to our operations as a whole. As such, we currently do not enter into currency forward exchange or option contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures.
Market Risk
As of December 31, 2024, 
6,399,171
 warrants from our RDOs remained outstanding at a fair value of 
$8.6 million
. The fair value of the warrant liabilities is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is therefore sensitive to changes in the market price and volatility of our common stock among other factors. In the event of a hypothetical 10% increase in the market price of our common stock (
$2.82 
based on the 
$2.56 
market price of our stock at December 31, 2024) on which the December 31, 2024 valuation was based, the fair value of the warrant liabilities would have increased by 
$1.3 million
. Similarly, based on the fair value of the warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2024, a hypo
thetical 10% decrease in the market price of our common stock would have decreased the fair value of the warrant liabilities by $1.2 million. S
uch increase or decrease would have been reflected as a change in fair value of warrant liabilities in 
other income (expense), net
, on the consolidated statement of operations.
Inflation Risk
Inflation may affect us by increasing our cost of labor, clinical trial, and other costs. We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations for any period presented herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of ImmunityBio, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ImmunityBio, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

Related party transactions and disclosures
Description of the 
Matter
As described in Notes 12 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s Founder, Executive Chairman and Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong has a controlling interest in certain entities with which the Company has entered into material transactions including related-party debt transactions with Nant Capital, LLC. Affiliates of such entities are also affiliates of the Company due to the common control of the Company’s Founder, Executive Chairman and Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer.
Assessing the sufficiency of procedures performed to identify related parties and significant related-party transactions and determining the identified significant related-party transactions were properly recorded, presented and disclosed was challenging due to the nature, volume and the significance of related-party transactions.
How We Addressed 
the Matter in Our 
Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Company’s related-party process. This included testing controls over management’s identification, review, recognition and disclosure of significant related-party transactions.
The audit procedures we performed included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the listing of related parties identified and significant related-party transactions provided by management, and testing the manner in which significant related party transactions were recorded, presented and disclosed. We performed journal entry searches of identified related parties to verify completeness and accuracy of the Company’s significant related-party transactions. We inquired of management, members of the Company’s audit committee, and the Company’s related-party transaction committee chair regarding the completeness of the significant related-party transactions identified. We also inspected questionnaires received from the Company’s directors and officers, read minutes of the meetings of Board of Directors and its various Committees, read employment and compensation contracts, proxy statements and other relevant filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that relate to the Company’s financial relationships and transactions with the Company’s executive officers and with other entities controlled by the Company’s Founder, Executive Chairman and Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer. We confirmed the significant transactions and/or balances, as applicable, with the related parties. We also obtained the underlying agreements for significant related-party transactions and assessed the associated accounting and recognition. We involved valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies and reasonableness of the assumptions used in the valuation of the related-party debt including underlying conversion features, as described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1.    
Description of Business
In these notes to the consolidated financial statements, the terms “ImmunityBio,” “the company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to ImmunityBio and subsidiaries.
Our Business
ImmunityBio is a vertically-integrated commercial stage biotechnology company developing next-generation therapies that bolster the natural immune system to defeat cancers and infectious diseases. The company’s range of immunotherapy platforms, alone and together, act to drive an immune response with the goal of creating durable immune memory generating safe protection against disease. We are applying our science and platforms to treating cancers, including the development of potential cancer vaccines, as well as developing immunotherapies and cell therapies that we believe sharply reduce or eliminate the need for standard high-dose chemotherapy. These platforms and their associated product candidates are designed to be more effective, accessible, and easily administered than current standards of care in oncology and infectious diseases.
Our platforms and their associated product and product candidates are designed to attack cancer and infectious pathogens by activating both the innate immune system, including NK cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages, as well as the adaptive immune system comprising B and T cells, in an orchestrated manner. The goal of this potentially best-in-class approach is to generate immunogenic cell death thereby eliminating rogue cells from the body whether they are cancerous or virally-infected. Our ultimate goal is to overcome the limitations of current treatments, such as CPIs, by turning immunologically cold, MHC-deficient tumors hot and/or reducing the need for standard high-dose chemotherapy in cancer by employing a coordinated approach to establish “immunological memory” that confers long-term benefit for the patient.
Our proprietary platforms for the development of biologic products and product candidates include: (i) cytokine fusion proteins, (ii) vaccine vectors, and (iii) cell therapies. Specifically, our core clinical focus is on bladder and lung cancers with additional clinical efforts in prostate and colorectal cancers, hematologic malignancies and GBM, which are among the most frequent and lethal cancer types, and where there are high failure rates for existing standards of care or no available effective treatment.
Our lead biologic product ANKTIVA is a novel first-in-class IL-15 receptor superagonist antibody-cytokine fusion protein. On April 22, 2024, the FDA approved our product, ANKTIVA with BCG for the treatment of adult patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with CIS with or without papillary tumors. ANKTIVA was approved with a label indicating an immunological mechanism of action which proliferates and activates NK, CD8+ and memory T cells without the proliferation of immunosuppressive T-reg cells. We began commercial distribution of our approved product in May 2024.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain items in prior years consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations. The consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations.

Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and a VIE for which the company is the primary beneficiary. Any material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. For consolidated entities in which we have less than 100% ownership, we record 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax,
 on the consolidated statement of operations equal to the percentage of the ownership interest retained in such entities by the respective noncontrolling parties. 
168
Table of Conten
t
s
We assess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE at the inception of the arrangement and at each reporting date. This assessment is based on our power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and our obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.
If the entity is within the scope of the variable interest model and meets the definition of a VIE, we consider whether we must consolidate the VIE or provide additional disclosures regarding our involvement with the VIE. If we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, we will consolidate the VIE. This analysis is performed at the initial investment in the entity or upon any reconsideration event.
For entities we hold as an equity investment that are not consolidated under the VIE model, we consider whether our investment constitutes a controlling financial interest in the entity and therefore should be considered for consolidation under the voting interest model.

Liquidity
As of December 31, 2024, the company had an accumulated deficit of $
3.4
 billion. We also had negative cash flows from operations of $
391.2
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. The company will need to obtain additional financing to fund our future operations, including the commercialization of our approved product and the development and commercialization of our other product candidates.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business, and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of the uncertainty of our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result of continuing anticipated operating cash outflows as we commercialize our approved product and accelerate our development efforts, we believe that substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to continue as a going concern without additional funding or financial support. However, we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, and investments in marketable securities; sales of our approved product; capital to be raised through equity offerings; and our potential ability to borrow from affiliated entities will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next 12 months following the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements based primarily upon our Founder, Executive Chairman and Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer’s intent and ability to support our operations with additional funds, including loans from affiliated entities, as required, which we believe alleviates such doubt. 
In addition to funds from the future sales of our approved product, which we expect to take time to establish, we may also seek to sell additional equity, through one or more follow-on offerings, or in separate financings, or obtain incremental subordinated debt in compliance with our existing revenue interest liability. However, we may not be able to secure such external financing in a timely manner or on favorable terms. Without significant sales of our approved product or additional funds, we may choose to delay or reduce our operating or investment expenditures. Further, because of the risk and uncertainties associated with the commercialization of our approved product and our other product candidates, we may need additional funds to meet our needs sooner than planned.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and the assessment of our ability to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific and relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Estimates are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information and anticipated future events, and accordingly, actual results may ultimately differ materially from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition
Product Revenue, Net
After FDA approval in April 2024, the company began recognizing revenue from the sale of ANKTIVA in accordance with ASC 606. The provisions of ASC 606 require the following steps to determine revenue recognition: (i) identification of contract with the customers; (ii) identification of performance obligations; (iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration; (iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations based on estimated selling prices; and (v) recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy each performance obligation. At contract inception, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract, determine whether each promised good or service is distinct and identify those that are performance obligations. We recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. 
The company entered into a third-party logistics agreement to engage a 3PL Agent to distribute the company’s products to its customers. The 3PL Agent provides services to the company that include storage, shipping and distribution, processing product returns, as well as customer service, order to cash, and logistics support. The company’s customers are currently limited to pharmaceutical specialty distributors and specialty pharmacy. The company primarily sells ANKTIVA to specialty distributors through a drop-ship arrangement under which orders from various healthcare institutions such as hospitals, medical facilities, physician practices, pharmacies and government agencies are processed through and controlled by specialty distributors. Under the drop-ship arrangement, the 3PL Agent ships the product to various health care institutions without the specialty distributor ever taking physical possession of the product. The company recognizes product revenue when ANKTIVA is delivered to the end user as instructed and controlled by specialty distributors. 
The company also sells ANKTIVA directly to a specialty pharmacy who then subsequently distributes ANKTIVA to physicians, clinics, and certain medical centers, hospitals or other healthcare institutions. The company recognizes product revenue when ANKTIVA is delivered to the specialty pharmacy location.
Product revenue is recorded with each sale at wholesale acquisition cost, net of: (a) consideration payable to customers; and (b) variable considerations. The company pays fees to the specialty distributors for certain administrative services associated with the distribution of the product wherein the terms of which are also detailed in its contracts. Such fees are not for a distinct good or service and, accordingly, are recorded as a reduction of revenue, as well as a reduction of accounts receivable (trade discounts) or as a component of accrued expenses (distributor fees). The variable consideration components include, but are not limited to, prompt payment discounts, product returns, chargebacks, rebates, and co-payment assistance, which are collectively referred to as “Gross-to-Net Adjustments.” In accordance with ASC 606, the company must make significant judgments to determine the estimates for certain variable considerations. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The company utilizes the expected value method when estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price with respect to each of the foregoing variable consideration components. Where appropriate, these estimates are based on factors such as industry and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns, our experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, and specific known market events and trends. 
Variable considerations are reassessed each reporting period, and adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which affects product revenue and net income in the period of adjustment. The actual amounts of variable consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in future periods vary from our estimates, we adjust these estimates accordingly. As we gain more experience, estimates will be more heavily based on the expected utilization from historical data we have accumulated since the ANKTIVA product launch. The consideration payable to customers and contingent considerations reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contracts.
Other Revenues
Prior to the approval of ANKTIVA for commercial sale, we primarily generated revenues from non-exclusive license agreements related to our cell lines, the sale of our bioreactors and related consumables, and grant programs. The company expects to continue to generate revenue from these programs.
170
Table of Conten
t
s
We sell our proprietary GMP-in-a-Box bioreactors and related consumables to affiliated companies and third parties. The arrangements typically include delivery of bioreactors, consumables, and providing installation service and perpetual software licenses for using the equipment. We recognize revenue when customers obtain control and can benefit from the promised goods or services, generally upon installation of the bioreactors, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Upfront payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt and recognized as revenue when we satisfy our performance obligations under these arrangements.
Grant revenue is typically paid for reimbursable costs incurred over the duration of the associated research project or clinical trial and is recognized either when expenses reimbursable under the grants have been incurred and payments under the grants become contractually due or when cash is received, depending on the certainty of payment and other factors specific to each grant. 
License Agreements with Third Parties
The company has nonexclusive license agreements with a limited number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that grant them the right to use our cell lines and intellectual property for non-clinical use. These agreements generally include upfront fees and annual research license fees for such use, as well as commercial license fees for sales of the licensee products developed or manufactured using our intellectual property and cell lines. 
Under our license agreements with customers, we typically promise to provide a license to use certain cell lines and related patents, the related know-how, and future research and development data that affect the license. We have concluded that these promises represent a single performance obligation due to the highly interrelated nature of the promises. We provide the cell lines and know-how immediately upon entering into the contracts. Research and development data are provided throughout the term of the contract when and if available. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. 
Our license agreements may include non-refundable upfront payments, event-based milestone payments, sales-based royalty payments, or some combination of these. The event-based milestone payments represent variable consideration, and we use the most likely amount method to estimate this variable consideration. Given the high degree of uncertainty around the achievement of these milestones, we do not recognize revenue from these milestone payments until the uncertainty associated with these payments is resolved. We currently estimate variable consideration related to milestone payments to be zero and, as such, no revenue has been recognized for milestone payments. We recognize revenue from sales-based royalty payments when or as sales occur. On a quarterly basis, we re-evaluate our estimate of milestone variable consideration to determine whether any amount should be included in the transaction price and recorded in revenue prospectively.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales consists primarily of third-party manufacturing costs, distribution, and overhead costs related to sales of approved product subsequent to receiving regulatory approval. Cost of sales may also include costs related to excess or obsolete inventory adjustment charges, abnormal costs, unabsorbed manufacturing and overhead costs, and manufacturing variances. All costs associated with the production of ANKTIVA prior to receiving regulatory approval were expensed in 
research and development expense
, on the consolidated statement of operations in the period incurred and therefore are not reflected in cost of sales.

Accounts Receivable, Net
Accounts receivable is recorded net of allowances for prompt payment discounts, product returns, chargebacks, and credit losses. The company estimates an allowance for credit losses by considering factors such as credit quality, the age of the accounts receivable balances, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. As of December 31, 2024, the credit profile for the company’s counterparty was deemed to be in good standing, and as such an allowance for credit losses was not recorded.

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost, which includes amounts related to materials, labor and overhead, is determined in a manner that approximates the first-in, first-out method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. See 
Note 4
 “
Inventories”
 for more information.
Contingencies
We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We accrue for the best estimate of a loss within a range; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount in the range. If we determine that a material loss is reasonably possible, we disclose the possible loss or range of loss, or that the amount of loss cannot be estimated at this time. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause a change in the potential amount of the liability recorded or the range of potential losses disclosed. Moreover, we record gain contingencies only when they are realizable, and the amount is known. Additionally, we record our rights to insurance recoveries, limited to the extent of incurred or probable losses, as a receivable when such recoveries have been agreed to with our third-party insurers and when receipt is deemed probable. This includes instances when our third-party insurers have agreed to pay, on our behalf, certain legal defense costs and settlement amounts directly to applicable law firms and a settlement fund.
Concentration of Major Customers
The company relies heavily on the limited number of customers to market and distribute ANKTIVA to various healthcare institutions or end users through the drop-ship arrangement. For the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 
92
% of our total gross revenue was from our top three customers. The largest customer accounted for 
38
% of our total revenue, while the second and third largest accounted for 
29
% and 
25
%, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, our accounts receivable, net are mainly from sales of ANKTIVA, and the majority are from specialty distributors.
Our dependency on a few key customers exposes us to several risks, including the potential for disruptions in our distribution network, changes in customers’ business strategies, or financial difficulties faced by these customers. Any significant disruption or change in our relationship with these customers could materially and adversely affect our ability to effectively reach other potential end users and maintain our market position. Additionally, we maintain regular communication and strong relationships with our existing customers to ensure alignment with our business objectives. 
While we believe our relationships with these customers are strong and mutually beneficial, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain these relationships or that we will be able to replace them with new specialty distributors if necessary.
Concentration of Credit Risk and Other Risks and Uncertainties
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentration of risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable and a convertible note receivable. 
We attempt to minimize credit risk associated with our cash and cash equivalents by periodically evaluating the credit quality of our primary financial institutions. Our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy. While we maintain cash deposits in FDIC insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits, we do not believe that we are exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which those deposits are held. We have not experienced any losses on such accounts. 
We also monitor the creditworthiness of the borrower of the convertible note receivable. We believe that any concentration of credit risk in its convertible note receivable was mitigated in part by our ability to convert, if necessary, at the qualifying financing event or upon a payment default into shares of the senior class of equity securities of the borrower.
Product candidates developed by us will require approvals or clearances from the FDA or international regulatory agencies prior to commercial sales. There can be no assurance that any of our product candidates will receive any of the required approvals or clearances. If we were to be denied approval or clearance or any such approval or clearance was to be delayed, it would have a material adverse impact on us.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash
Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase.
Restricted cash includes a certificate of deposit held as a substitute letter of credit for one of our leased properties. This certificate of deposit is included in 
other assets,
 on the consolidated balance sheet as the landlord is the beneficiary of the account and we are not able to access the funds during the term of the lease.
A reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash is included on the consolidated statements of cash flows as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Marketable Securities and Other Investments
Marketable Debt Securities
We have typically invested our cash in a variety of financial instruments, including investment-grade short- to intermediate-term corporate debt securities, government-sponsored securities and European bonds; however, after our entry into the RIPA, we can no longer invest our excess funds in corporate or European bonds. Certain of our investments are subject to credit, liquidity, market, and interest-rate risks. The general condition of the financial markets and the economy may increase those risks and may affect the value and liquidity of investments and restrict our ability to access the capital markets. Marketable debt securities with remaining maturities of 12 months or less are classified as short-term and marketable securities with remaining maturities greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. All marketable debt securities are reported at fair value and any unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of 
accumulated other comprehensive income,
 on the consolidated statement of stockholders’ deficit, with the exception of unrealized losses believed to be other-than-temporary, which are recorded in 
interest and investment income (loss), net
, on the consolidated statement of operations. Realized gains and losses from sales of securities and the amounts, net of tax, reclassified out of 
accumulated other comprehensive income
, if any, are determined on a specific identification basis.
Marketable Equity Securities
Investments in mutual funds and equity securities, other than equity method investments, are recorded at fair market value, if fair value is readily determinable and any unrealized gains and losses are included in 
other income (expense), net,
 on the consolidated statement of operations. Realized gains and losses from the sale of the securities are determined on a specific identification basis and the amounts are included in 
other income (expense), net,
 on the consolidated statement of operations.
Evaluating Investments for Other-than-Temporary Impairments
We periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments below their book value are other-than-temporary. This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss, as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Additionally, we assess whether we have plans to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Factors considered include quoted market prices, recent financial results and operating trends, implied values from any recent transactions or offers of investee securities, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, other publicly available information that may affect the value of our investments, duration and severity of the decline in value, and our strategy and intentions for holding the investment. There were no other-than-temporary impairments recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Equity Method of Accounting
In circumstances where we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of a company in which we have an investment, we utilize the equity method of accounting for recording investment activity. In assessing whether we exercise significant influence, we consider the nature and magnitude of our investment, the voting and protective rights we hold, any participation in the governance of the other company and other relevant factors such as the presence of a collaborative or other business relationship. Under the equity method of accounting, we record our share of the income or loss of the other company as 
loss on equity method investment
, on the consolidated statement of operations.

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Historical cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. All repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expenses during the financial period in which they are incurred. 
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:
Buildings
39
 years
Software
3
 years
Laboratory equipment
5
 to 
7
 years
Furniture & fixtures

IT equipment

Leasehold improvements
The lesser of the lease term or life of the asset
Upon disposal of property, plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated financial statements and the net amount, less any proceeds, is included in 
other income (expense), net
, on the consolidated statement of operations.
We review impairment of property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the future net cash flows that the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flows arising from the assets using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent to our current business model.
Asset Acquisitions and Business Combinations
We make certain judgments to determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of assets or as business combinations. If it is determined that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets acquired in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the transaction is treated as an acquisition of assets. We evaluate the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities and assets. If the assets in a transaction include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs, the transaction is treated as an acquisition of a business.
In transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions, the cost of an asset acquisition, including transaction costs, are allocated to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on a relative fair value basis. Goodwill is not recognized in an asset acquisition. Any difference between the cost of an asset acquisition and the fair value of the net assets acquired is allocated to the non-monetary identifiable assets based on their relative fair values. In an asset acquisition, upfront payments allocated to in-process research and development projects at the acquisition date are expensed unless there is an alternative future use. In addition, product development milestones are expensed upon achievement. Any contingent consideration, such as payments upon achievement of various developmental, regulatory, and commercial milestones, generally is not recognized at the acquisition date.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed generally be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Estimating fair value requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions. We perform impairment testing of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. Acquisition costs related to a business combination are expensed as incurred.
174
Table of Conten
t
s
Contingent consideration incurred in connection with a business combination are recorded at their fair values on the acquisition date and re-measured at their fair values each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved. The resulting changes in fair value are recorded as research and development expense, on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Changes in fair value reflect changes to our assumptions regarding probabilities of successful achievement of related milestones, the timing in which the milestones are expected to be achieved, and the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the obligation.
Common Control Transactions
Transactions between us and entities where Dr. Soon-Shiong and his affiliates are the controlling stockholders are accounted for as common control transactions whereby the net assets acquired or transferred are accounted at their carrying value. Any difference between the carrying value and consideration recognized is treated as a capital transaction. Cash consideration up to the carrying value of the net assets acquired or transferred is presented as an investing activity on the consolidated statement of cash flows. Cash consideration in excess of the carrying value of the net assets acquired or transferred is presented as a financing activity on the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Intangible Assets, Net
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination or an asset acquisition are initially recognized at their fair value on the acquisition date. Acquired indefinite-lived assets, such as IPR&D acquired in a business combination, are not amortized until they become definite-lived assets, upon the successful completion of the associated research and development effort. At that time, we evaluate whether the recorded amounts are impaired and make any necessary adjustments and then determine the useful life of the asset and begin amortization. If the associated research and development effort is abandoned, the related IPR&D assets is written-off and an impairment charge recorded. IPR&D acquired in an asset acquisition is expensed immediately.
Acquired definite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives. The amortization of these intangible assets is included in 
selling, general and administrative expense,
 on the consolidated statement of operations. Intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist.

Patents
Patent costs, including related legal costs, are expensed as incurred and recorded in 
selling, general and administrative expense,
 on the consolidated statement of operations.
Cloud Computing Arrangement
The company capitalizes implementation costs under a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract in line with its policy for internal-use software. Costs incurred during the application development stage related to the implementation of the hosting arrangement are capitalized and included in 
prepaid expenses and other current assets
 and 
other assets, 
on the consolidated balance sheet. Amortization of capitalized implementation costs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the terms of the underlying hosting arrangement when it is ready for its intended use. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred.
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as an exit price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. We use a three-tier fair value hierarchy to classify and disclose all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, in periods subsequent to their initial measurement. The hierarchy requires us to use observable inputs when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs, when determining fair value.
The three tiers are defined as follows:
•
Level 1—Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, the valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment. Our Level 1 assets consist of bank deposits, money market funds, and marketable equity securities.
175
Table of Conten
t
s
•
Level 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly in the marketplace for identical or similar assets and liabilities. Our Level 2 assets consist of corporate debt securities including commercial paper, government-sponsored securities, and corporate bonds, as well as foreign municipal securities.
•
Level 3—Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
We utilize a third-party pricing service to assist in obtaining fair value pricing for our investments in marketable debt securities. Inputs are documented in accordance with the fair value disclosure hierarchy. The fair values of financial instruments other than marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents are determined through a combination of management estimates and third-party valuations.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, no transfers were made into or out of the Level 1, 2 or 3 categories. We will continue to review the fair value inputs on a quarterly basis.
Collaboration Arrangements
We analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of FASB ASC Topic 808, 
Collaborative Arrangements 
(ASC 808). A collaborative arrangement is a contractual arrangement that involves joint operating activity. These arrangements involve two or more parties who are active participants in the activity and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activity. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. To the extent the collaboration agreement is within the scope of ASC 808, we also assess whether the arrangement contains multiple elements that are within the scope of other accounting literature. If we conclude that some or all aspects of the agreement are distinct and represent a transaction with a customer, we account for those aspects of the arrangement within the scope of ASC 606. Amounts that are owed by collaboration partners within the scope of ASC 808 are recognized as an offset to research and development expense as such amounts are incurred by the collaboration partner. The amounts owed to a collaboration partner are classified as research and development expense.
Our collaboration arrangements require us to acquire certain equipment for exclusive use in the joint operating activities. These equipment purchases do not have an alternative use and are therefore expensed as incurred within research and development expense.
Our collaboration arrangements are further discussed in 
Note 8

“Collaboration and License Agreements and Acquisition.”
Preclinical and Clinical Trial Accruals
As part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate expenses resulting from obligations under contracts with vendors, clinical research organizations and consultants. The financial terms of these contracts vary and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided under such contracts.
We estimate clinical trial and research agreement-related expenses based on the services performed, pursuant to contracts with research institutions and clinical research organizations and other vendors that conduct clinical trials and research on our behalf. In accruing clinical and research-related fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and activity expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. Payments made under these arrangements in advance of the receipt of the related services are recorded as prepaid expenses until the services are rendered.
Transactions with Related Parties
As outlined in 
Note 12

“Related-Party Debt”
 and 
Note 13

“Related-Party Agreements,”
 we have various agreements with related parties. These arrangements can be billed and settled in cash monthly, billed quarterly and settled in cash the following month, or estimated in advance and collected or paid upfront based on expected utilization. Monthly accruals are made for all quarterly billing arrangements.

Lease Obligations
For all leases other than short-term leases, at the lease commencement date, a right-of-use asset and a lease liability are recognized. The right-of-use asset represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. At the commencement date, lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are determined based on the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases. 
As the rate implicit in lease contracts are not readily determinable, we utilize its incremental borrowing rate as a discount rate for purposes of determining the present value of lease payments, which is based on the estimated interest rate at which we could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment. Prospectively, we will remeasure the lease liability at the net present value of the remaining lease payments using the same incremental borrowing rate that was in effect as of the lease commencement or transition date. 
Operating lease right-of-use assets also include any rent paid prior to the commencement date, less any lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We determine the lease term by assuming the exercise of renewal options that are reasonably assured. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. 
We combine our lease components (e.g., fixed payments including rent, real estate taxes and insurance costs) with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance costs and equipment maintenance costs) and as such, we account for lease and non-lease components as a single component. Lease expense also includes amounts relating to variable lease payments. Variable lease payments include amounts relating to common area maintenance and real estate taxes.
We do not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for qualifying short-term leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less at lease inception. Such leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The lease term includes the non-cancellable period of the lease and any additional periods covered by either options to renew or not to terminate when the company is reasonably certain to exercise.
The depreciable life of operating right-of-use-assets and leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term.
Warrants
The company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant’s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the company’s own stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement” in a circumstance outside of the company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.
For warrants that meet all criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of 
additional paid-in capital,
 on the consolidated statement of stockholders’ deficit at the time of issuance. For warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and on each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recorded as a non-cash gain or loss in 
other income (expense), net
, on the consolidated statement of operations. The fair value of the warrants was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

Fair Value Option Election
The company elected to apply the FVO method of accounting in accordance with ASC 825 and accounts for certain of its notes and embedded derivatives at fair value as a single instrument in accordance with ASC 815. The notes for which the FVO is elected are recorded at fair value upon the date of issuance and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of the notes accounted for at fair value are recorded as a component of 
other income (expense), net, 
on the consolidated statement of operations. Any changes in fair value caused by instrument-specific credit risk are recorded separately in 
other comprehensive income (loss), 
on the consolidated statement of comprehensive loss. The cumulative amount previously recorded in 
other comprehensive income (loss)
 resulting from changes in the instrument-specific credit risk for extinguished notes are reclassified and reported in current earnings on the consolidated statement of operations. All costs associated with the issuance of the convertible promissory note accounted for using the FVO were expensed upon issuance.
The company has applied the FVO on the $
505.0
 million December 2024 Promissory Note and $
30.0
 million March 2023 Promissory Note prior to its extinguishment on December 29, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the company recorded $

Debt Modification and Extinguishment
The company evaluates amendments to its debt instruments in accordance with ASC 470-50. This evaluation includes comparing (1) if applicable, the net present value of future cash flows of the amended debt to that of the original debt and (2) the change in fair value of an embedded conversion feature to that of the carrying amount of the debt immediately prior to amendment to determine, in each case, if a change greater than 10% occurred. In instances where the net present value of future cash flows or the fair value of an embedded conversion feature, if any, changed more than 10%, the company applies extinguishment accounting. In instances where the net present value of future cash flows and the fair value of an embedded conversion feature, if any, changed less than 10%, the company accounts for the amendment to the debt as a debt modification. Gains and losses on debt amendments that are considered extinguishments are recognized in current earnings or in 
additional paid-in capital
 if the transactions are with entities under common control. Debt amendments that are considered debt modifications are accounted for prospectively through yield adjustments, based on the revised terms. Legal fees and other costs incurred with third parties that are directly related to debt modifications are expensed as incurred. Amounts paid by the company to the lenders, are reflected as additional debt discount and amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over remaining term of modified debt using the effective interest rate method.
Income Taxes
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized.
We recognize uncertain tax positions when the position will more likely than not be upheld on examination by the taxing authorities based solely upon the technical merits of the positions. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized income tax uncertainties in 
income tax benefit (expense),
 on the consolidated statement of operations. We did not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Stock Repurchases
In 2015, the Board of Directors approved the 2015 Share Repurchase Program. As it is our intent for the repurchased shares to be retired, we have elected to account for the shares repurchased using the constructive retirement method. For shares repurchased in excess of par, we record the purchase price in excess of par value in 
accumulated deficit
, on the consolidated balance sheet.
Revenue Interest Liability
On December 29, 2023, we entered into the RIPA with Infinity and Oberland. Pursuant to the RIPA, Oberland acquired certain Revenue Interests (as defined in the RIPA) from us for a gross purchase price of $
200.0
 million paid on closing and acquired additional Revenue Interests from us for a gross purchase price of $
100.0
 million paid on May 13, 2024. Under the 
178
Table of Conten
t
s
RIPA, Oberland has the right to receive quarterly payments from us based on, among other things, a certain percentage of our worldwide net sales, excluding those in China, during such quarter. The RIPA is considered a sale of future revenues and is accounted for as a liability net of a debt discount comprised of deferred issuance costs, the fair value of a freestanding option agreement related to the SPOA, and the fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation on the consolidated balance sheet. The company imputes interest expense associated with this liability using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is calculated based on the rate that would enable the debt to be repaid in full over the anticipated life of the arrangement. Interest expense is recognized over the estimated term on the consolidated statement of operations. The interest rate on this liability may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors, including the level of actual and forecasted net sales. The company evaluates the interest rate quarterly based on actual and forecasted net sales utilizing the prospective method. A significant increase or decrease in actual or forecasted net sales will materially impact the revenue interest liability, interest expense, and the time period for repayment.
Derivative Liabilities
Embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from the underlying debt instrument that do not meet the derivative scope exception and equity classification criteria are accounted for and valued as separate financial instruments. The terms of an embedded derivative related to a contingent exercisable prepayment feature of a convertible note have been evaluated and deemed to require bifurcation. This embedded derivative was initially measured at fair value and is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the derivative is settled. On December 10, 2024, the company and Nant Capital entered into a second amended and restated promissory note (the $
505.0
 million December 2024 Promissory Note) for which the FVO method of accounting was elected. As such, the bifurcation of the embedded derivative is not required. The embedded derivative is now included within the fair value of the second amended and restated promissory note recorded within 
related-party convertible note payable at fair value
, on the consolidated balance sheet. 
In addition, the RIPA contains certain features that meet the definition of being an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation as a separate compound financial instrument apart from the RIPA. The derivative liability is initially measured at fair value upon issuance and is subject to remeasurement at each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in 
other income (expense), net
, on the consolidated statement of operations.
Research and Development Costs
Major components of research and development costs include cash compensation and other personnel-related expenses, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense on research and development property and equipment and intangible assets, costs of preclinical studies, clinical trials costs, including CROs and related clinical manufacturing, including third-party CMOs, costs of drug development, costs of materials and supplies, facilities cost, overhead costs, regulatory and compliance costs, and fees paid to consultants and other entities that conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf. Costs incurred in research and development are expensed as incurred.
The company classifies its research and development expenses as either external or internal. The company’s external research and development expenses support its various preclinical and clinical programs. The company’s internal research and development expenses include payroll and benefits expenses, facilities and equipment expense, and other indirect research and development expenses incurred in support of its research and development activities. The company’s external and internal resources are not directly tied to any one research or drug discovery program and are typically deployed across multiple programs and are not allocated to specific product candidates or development programs.
Included in research and development costs are clinical trial and research expenses based on the services performed pursuant to contracts with research institutions and clinical research organizations and other vendors that conduct clinical trials and research on our behalf. We record accruals for estimated costs under these contracts. When evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liabilities, we analyze the progress of the preclinical studies or clinical trials, including the phase or completion of events, invoices received, contracted costs and purchase orders. Significant judgments and estimates are made in determining the accrued balances at the end of any reporting period based on the facts and circumstances known at that time. Although we do not expect the estimates to be materially different from the amounts actually incurred, if the estimates of the status and timing of services performed differ from the actual status and timing of services performed, we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. Actual results could differ from our estimates. We adjust the accruals in the period when actual costs become known.

Stock-Based Compensation
We account for stock-based compensation under the provisions of ASC 718. We estimate fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions, including, but not limited to, expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and the expected term of the stock options. We measure the fair value of an equity-classified award at the grant date and recognize the stock-based compensation expense over the period of vesting on the straight-line basis for our outstanding share awards that do not contain a performance condition. For awards subject to performance-based vesting conditions, we assess the probability of the individual milestones under the award being achieved and stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the service period using the graded vesting method once management believes the performance criteria is probable of being met. For awards with service or performance conditions, we recognize the effect of forfeitures in compensation cost in the period that the award was forfeited. See

Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Comprehensive income or loss is composed of net (loss) income and other comprehensive (loss) income. Our other comprehensive income or loss consists of net unrealized gains (losses) on marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale, the change in fair value of convertible note resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk, net of income taxes and foreign currency translation adjustments.
Noncontrolling Interests
Noncontrolling interests are recorded for the entities that we consolidate but are not wholly-owned by the company. Noncontrolling interests are classified as a separate component of equity on the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of stockholders’ deficit. Additionally, net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests is reflected separately from consolidated net loss on the consolidated statement of operations and the consolidated statement of stockholders’ deficit. We record the noncontrolling interests’ share of loss based on the percentage of ownership interest retained by the respective noncontrolling interest holders.
 Noncontrolling interests recorded on the consolidated financial statements result from the company’s share of GlobeImmune, of which we controlled 
69.1
% as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and NANTibody, of which we controlled 
100.0
% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and 
60.0
% as of December 31, 2022, respectively. Noncontrolling interest stockholders are common stockholders.
GlobeImmune was determined to be a VIE as it does not have sufficient equity investment at risk to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support and we are deemed the primary beneficiary of GlobeImmune and, accordingly, consolidate GlobeImmune into the company’s consolidated financial statements under the VIE model. The company also supports GlobeImmune through a promissory note agreement, in which the company provides advances to GlobeImmune from time to time up to $
6.0
 million with a per annum interest rate of five percent (
5
%). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no outstanding advances due from GlobeImmune under the promissory note agreement.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, GlobeImmune recognized 
no
 revenue and recognized operating expenses of $
0.3
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and $
0.5
 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the consolidated balance sheets included approximately $
1.4
 million of total assets that can only be used to settle obligations of GlobeImmune, and 
immaterial
 liabilities, respectively, related to GlobeImmune. The creditors of GlobeImmune do not have recourse to the general credit of the primary beneficiary.
Foreign Currencies
We have operations and hold assets in Italy and South Korea. The functional currency of the subsidiary in Italy is the Euro, based on the nature of the transactions occurring within this entity, and accordingly, assets and liabilities of this subsidiary are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing as of the balance sheet dates, while the operating results are translated into U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates for the period correlating with those operating results. Adjustments resulting from translating the financial statements of the foreign subsidiary into U.S. dollars are recorded as a component of 
other comprehensive (loss) income
, on the consolidated statement of comprehensive loss. Transaction gains and losses are recorded in 
other income (expense), net,
 on the consolidated statement of operations.

Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share of Common Stock
Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss attributable to ImmunityBio common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to ImmunityBio common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares, including the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Application of New or Revised Accounting Standards – Adopted
In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03
, Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions
, which clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. This ASU also clarifies that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction and introduces certain disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to such restrictions. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2024 on a prospective basis with no impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-01, 
Leases – Common Control Arrangements (Topic 842).
 This ASU provides updated guidance for accounting for leasehold improvements associated with common control leases. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2024 on a prospective basis with no impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, which requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 on a retrospective basis. We adopted this ASU on December 31, 2024 on a retrospective basis. See 
Note 19
 “Segment and Geographic Information”
 for more information. 
Application of New or Revised Accounting Standards – Not Yet Adopted
In August 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-05, 
Business Combinations-Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement
, which requires a joint venture to initially measure all contributions received upon its formation at fair value. This ASU is applicable to joint venture entities with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025 on a prospective basis. We will apply this guidance prospectively in future reporting periods after the guidance is effective to any future arrangements meeting the definition of a joint venture.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
, to improve its income tax disclosure requirements. Under this ASU, entities must annually (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold, and (3) disclose more detailed information about income taxes paid, including by jurisdiction; pretax income (or loss) from continuing operations; and income tax expense (or benefit). This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
, which requires that public business entities disclose additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to financial statements at interim and annual reporting periods. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. This ASU may be applied either on a prospective or retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-04, 
Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20): Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments
, which clarifies the requirements for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments should be accounted for as an induced conversion. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025 and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our disclosures.
Other recent authoritative guidance issued by the FASB (including technical corrections to the ASC) and the SEC during the year ended December 31, 2024 did not, or are not expected to, have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

We began capitalizing inventory costs associated with ANKTIVA after receiving FDA approval in April 2024 when it was determined that the inventory had a probable future economic benefit.
Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and consists of raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods. Cost is determined using a standard cost method, which approximates actual cost, and assumes a FIFO flow of goods. Inventory that is used for clinical development purposes is expensed in 
research and development expense
, on the consolidated statement of operations when consumed.
Cost of sales consists primarily of third-party manufacturing costs, distribution, and overhead costs related to sales of approved product subsequent to receiving regulatory approval. Cost of sales may also include costs related to excess or obsolete inventory adjustment charges, abnormal costs, unabsorbed manufacturing and overhead costs, and manufacturing variances. All costs associated with the production of ANKTIVA prior to receiving regulatory approval were expensed in 
research and development expense
, on the consolidated statement of operations in the period incurred and therefore are not reflected in cost of sales.

Table of Conten

s
The work-in-progress materials consists of bulk drug substance and drug product, which have a multi-year shelf life. When the bulk drug substance is manufactured into ANKTIVA drug product, those goods have a shelf life of two years from the date of manufacture. During September 2024, the shelf life of ANKTIVA drug product was extended to three years. The work-in-progress drug product gets converted to finished goods at the time of labeling. Our expectation is to sell finished goods at least twelve months prior to expiration. Due to our long manufacturing lead time, it was necessary to build up inventory in support of ANKTIVA forecasted sales. As a result of being in the early stages of the ANKTIVA product launch, the company is continuing to evaluate the length of its operating cycle.
On a quarterly basis, the company analyzes its inventory levels for excess quantities and obsolescence (expiration), taking into account factors such as historical and anticipated future sales compared to quantities on hand and the remaining shelf life. As of December 31, 2024, we determined that a reserve related to ANKTIVA inventory for excess quantities and obsolescence was not required. In addition, since the FDA approval of ANKTIVA the company has not recorded any inventory write downs.

Convertible Note Receivable
In 2016, we executed a convertible promissory note pursuant to which we advanced Riptide a principal amount of $
5.0
 million. The note bears interest at a per annum rate of five percent (
5
%). Concurrent with the transaction, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Riptide to obtain worldwide exclusive rights, with the right to sublicense, certain know-how related to RP-182, RP-233 and RP-183. We are required to pay a single-digit royalty on net sales of the licensed products on a country-by-country basis. Pursuant to the license agreement, we are also required to make cash milestone payments upon successful completion of certain clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones up to an aggregate amount of $
47.0
 million for the first three indications of the licensed product with a maximum payment amount of $
100.0
 million.
In 2019, we entered into a first amendment to the convertible promissory note with Riptide. Under the agreement, we extended the maturity of the promissory note to the earlier of (a) the later of (i) the completion of non-clinical IND enabling studies by the company, or (ii) December 31, 2020; and (b) when we accelerate the maturity of the note upon the occurrence of an event of default. No other terms and conditions of the promissory note were modified. Concurrently, we also entered into a first amendment to the exclusive license agreement with Riptide and extended the achievement dates for certain clinical trial milestones related to the licensed products. This option for receiving a 
25
% discount was determined to have an immaterial value at inception and life-to-date of the note, as the probability of a future qualifying event is remote. The convertible note receivable balance was $
7.1
 million and $
6.9
 million, which included accrued interest of $
2.1
 million and $
1.9
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we evaluated our securities for other-than-temporary impairment and did

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we held investments in marketable equity securities with readily determinable fair values of $
0.3

Investment in Other Equity Security
In August 2024, the company entered into a SAFE with an unrelated party in exchange for the right to acquire certain shares of the investee. Upon the closing of equity financing by the investee prior to the termination of the SAFE, the SAFE will convert into preferred shares. We elected to apply the measurement alternative under FASB ASC Topic 321, 
Investments—Equity Securities
 (ASC 321), pursuant to which we measure our investment in the SAFE at cost, less impairment. As of December 31, 2024, we recorded an investment in the SAFE of $
0.7
 million in 
other assets
, on the consolidated balance sheet. We evaluate this investment for any indications of impairment in value on a quarterly basis. No factors indicative of impairment were identified during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Contingent consideration is recorded at estimated fair value and revalued each reporting period until the related contingency is resolved. The fair value measurement is based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement (i.e., a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy) and are reviewed periodically by management.

Non-financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value subsequent to initial recognition when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Except for the impairments discussed in 
Note 5

“Financial Statement Details—Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net”
 there were no other material non-financial assets or liabilities deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired and measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
We measured the fair value of the promissory notes and the embedded conversion features as of December 10, 2024, December 29, 2023 and September 11, 2023, respectively, upon debt amendments to determine the accounting treatment, using a “with and without” method. We used binomial lattice models for the “with” scenario and discounted cash flow analyses for the “without” scenario. Since certain of the factors analyzed are considered to be unobservable inputs, both the lattice model and the discounted cash flow model are considered to be a Level 3 valuation. See

Collaboration and License Agreements and Acquisition
Collaboration Agreements
National Cancer Institute 
The company and its subsidiaries began their relationship with HHS, as represented by the NCI of the NIH in 2015. Pursuant to the CRADAs, the NCI provides scientific staff and other support necessary to conduct research and related activities as described in the CRADAs. During the term of the initial and amended CRADAs, we collaborated with the NCI on the preclinical and clinical development of our proprietary adenovirus technology expressing TAAs for cancer immunotherapy. 
In 2021, the CRADA was amended and the research plan was modified to include the preclinical and clinical development of ImmunityBio’s proprietary adenovirus platform expressing TAAs, proprietary agent ANKTIVA and derivatives, an antibody-based cytokine fusion protein and derivatives and/or TxM product candidates, proprietary recombinant NK cells and mAbs, proprietary adjuvants, and other proprietary agents owned or controlled by ImmunityBio for cancer immunotherapy. The term of the CRADA was extended through May 2026. Under this agreement, we agreed to pay NCI funding totaling $
1.3
 million per year, payable in semi-annual installments each year through 2025. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 we recorded $
1.3
 million, and $
1.2
 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 in 
research and development expense,
 on the consolidated statements of operations.

Pursuant to the updated CRADA research plan, NCI and ImmunityBio will collaborate on the preclinical and clinical development of ImmunityBio’s proprietary adenovirus platform expressing TAAs, ANKTIVA and derivatives, an antibody-based cytokine fusion protein and derivatives and/or TxM product candidates, proprietary recombinant NK cells and mAbs, and other proprietary agents owned or controlled by ImmunityBio as contemplated in the research plan for cancer immunotherapy. Under the CRADA, any party may unilaterally terminate the agreement by providing timely advance written notice to the other party before the desired termination date. Pursuant to the terms of the CRADA, we have an option to elect to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive commercialization license to any inventions discovered in the performance of the CRADA. The parties jointly own any inventions and materials that are jointly produced by employees of both parties in the course of performing activities under the CRADA.
Amyris Joint Venture
In 2021, ImmunityBio and Amyris entered into a 50:50 joint venture arrangement and formed a new limited liability company to conduct the business of the joint venture. The purpose of the joint venture is to accelerate commercialization of a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine utilizing an RNA vaccine-platform. As part of the limited liability agreement, Amyris contributed $
1.0
 million in cash and rights to its license agreement with AAHI for an RNA platform for the field of COVID-19. ImmunityBio contributed $
1.0
 million in cash and priority access to its manufacturing capacity for the joint venture product. Both parties agreed to enter into a separate manufacturing and supply agreement and a sublicense agreement following the execution of the joint venture agreement. 
The joint venture agreement stipulates the initial terms for equal representation in the management of the newly-formed joint venture. The joint venture is managed by a board of directors consisting of four directors: two appointed by the company and two appointed by Amyris. Both parties agreed to make additional capital contributions in cash, in proportion to their respective interests, as determined by the board of directors of the joint venture.
We considered the joint venture entity as a VIE and determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of the VIE. We account for our investment in the joint venture using the equity method of accounting. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded our 
50
% share of net losses from the joint venture totaling $
7.5
 million and $
12.1
 million, respectively, in 
other income (expense), net
, on the consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, such losses incurred included $
7.5
 million and $
11.9
 million, respectively, attributable to expenses incurred by us on behalf of the joint venture. We are not obligated to fund the joint venture’s potential future losses. In August 2023, Amyris announced that it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The Amyris bankruptcy case remains ongoing, and there can be no assurance that we will receive any recovery on account of our claims against Amyris, including for Amyris’ portion of expenses incurred by the joint venture. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying amount of our equity investment in the joint venture was 
zero

License Agreements
3M IPC and AAHI License Agreement

We have licensed rights to 3M-052, a synthetic TLR7/8 agonist, 3M-052 formulations and related technology from 3M IPC and its affiliates and AAHI. In 2021 we obtained nonexclusive rights in the field of SARS-CoV-2 and in June 2022 we modified those rights and expanded the scope of the license to include (1) SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious diseases including malaria, HIV, tuberculosis, hookworm and varicella zoster on an exclusive basis in countries other than LMIC, and (2) oncology applications, when used in combination with our proprietary technology and/or IL-15 receptor superagonist. In consideration for the license, we agreed to make certain periodic license payments, including $
2.25
 million each year through June 2025. We have also agreed to make payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestone events and tiered royalties ranging from the low to high single-digits as a percentage of net sales. Beginning in April 2026, the annual minimum licensing payment is $
1.0
 million, which can be credited against any royalty payments due under this agreement. 
We made annual license maintenance fee payments of $
2.25
 million in 2024 and 2023, and $
1.75
 million in 2022. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded $

AAHI Agreements 
In 2021, ImmunityBio and AAHI entered into several agreements, including an RNA vaccine platform license agreement, an adjuvant formulation license agreement, and a sponsored research agreement (collectively, the “AAHI Agreements”). ImmunityBio is no longer pursuing development of the AAHI RNA platform and related technology it had licensed from AAHI in 2021. During the second half of 2024, the parties reached an agreement whereby ImmunityBio would owe no future payments to AAHI under the AAHI Agreements, ImmunityBio would return the licenses to AAHI, the AAHI Agreements were terminated, and each party mutually released and had no continuing obligations to the other. 
With respect to the license agreements, we recorded $
2.3

4.5

1.8
 million, respectively, in 
research and development expense
, on the consolidated statements of operations during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
With respect to the sponsored research agreement, we recorded

Acquisition
Dunkirk Facility Leasehold Interest
On February 14, 2022, we completed the acquisition of the Dunkirk Facility (approximately 
409,000
 rentable square feet) from Athenex, which we believe has the potential to provide us with a state-of-the-art biotech production center that will substantially expand and diversify our existing manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and the ability to scale production associated with certain of our product candidates. The company accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition because the Dunkirk Facility’s integrated set of assets and activities does not meet the definition of a business.
The total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $
40.5
 million, including a cash payment of $
40.0
 million, and transaction costs of approximately $
0.5
 million. 
The following table summarizes the fair value of assets acquired as of the acquisition date (in thousands):

Definite-lived intangible assets consist of favorable leasehold rights totaling $

Upon the closing of the Dunkirk transaction, the company became the tenant of the Dunkirk Facility under the Fort Schuyler Management Corporation Lease, dated October 1, 2021 and as amended as of the February 14, 2022 closing date (as amended, the Dunkirk Lease), with the FSMC as landlord. The Dunkirk Facility, as well as certain equipment, is owned by the FSMC and is leased to us under the Dunkirk Lease. Our annual lease payment will be $
2.00
 per year for an initial 
10-year
 term, with 
one
 option to renew the lease under substantially the same terms and conditions for an additional 
10-year
 term. As part of the transaction, we assumed certain of Athenex’s obligations under various third-party agreements (the Facility Agreements), subject to the terms and conditions of the purchase agreement by and between the company and Athenex dated as of January 7, 2022, and committed to spend an aggregate of $
1.52
 billion on operational expenses during the initial term, and an additional $
1.50
 billion on operational expenses if we elect to renew the lease for 
one
 additional 
10-year
 term. We also committed to hiring 
450
 employees at the Dunkirk Facility within the first five years following the Commencement Date, with 
300
 such employees to be hired within the first 2.5 years following the Commencement Date. We are eligible for certain sales-tax exemption savings during the development of the Dunkirk Facility, and certain property tax savings over the next 20 years, subject to certain terms and conditions, including performance of certain of the obligations described above. Failure to satisfy the obligations over the lease term may give rise to certain rights and remedies of governmental authorities including, for example, termination of the 
192
Table of Conten
t
s
Dunkirk Lease and other Facility Agreements and potential recoupment of a percentage of the grant funding received by Athenex for construction of the facility and other benefits received, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements. In addition, and related to the delayed completion of the facility as described above, in November 2024 we received written notice from our landlord alleging non-compliance with the initial employee headcount requirement of our lease for the Dunkirk Facility. While we are seeking to resolve this matter expeditiously, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in doing so, and we may lose access to the Dunkirk Facility. 
Although we believe that governmental funding will assist in funding a portion of the further buildout of the Dunkirk Facility, which we estimate to be approximately $
8.0
 million to $
10.0
 million of governmental funding remaining available as of December 31, 2024, there can be no assurance as to the final acceptance and timing of the requests for governmental funding that we submit, and we will need to plan and fund most of the additional buildout of, and purchase additional equipment for, the Dunkirk Facility in connection with our planned full operations. In addition, any future governmental funding will be subject to the eligibility of submitted expenses, as well as our compliance with the obligations that we are subject to pursuant to the agreements with parties regarding the Dunkirk Facility as described above. Further, on May 14, 2023, Athenex, together with certain of its subsidiaries, filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the Athenex Proceedings). We do not know what, if any, impact the Athenex Proceedings will have on any portion of the potential governmental funding remaining for the Dunkirk Facility.
Dunkirk Facility Workforce Reduction
In 2022, the company initiated a workforce reduction at the Dunkirk Facility and recorded severance and retention benefits for the terminated employees totaling $
1.0
 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 in 
selling, general and administrative expense
, 
on the consolidated statement of operations.

Commitments and Contingencies
Contingent Consideration Related to Business Combinations
VivaBioCell, S.p.A.
In April 2015, NantWorks, a related party, acquired a 
100
% interest in VivaBioCell through its wholly-owned subsidiary, VBC Holdings for $
0.7
 million, less working capital adjustments. In June 2015, NantWorks contributed its equity interest in VBC Holdings to the company, in exchange for cash consideration equal to its cost basis in the investment. VivaBioCell develops bioreactors and products based on cell culture and tissue engineering in Italy. 
In connection with our acquisition of VBC, we are obligated to pay the former owners contingent consideration upon the achievement of certain milestones related to the GMP-in-a-Box technology. If a government agency unconditionally approves the GMP-in-a-Box technology for commercial sale (the regulatory milestone) in the future, we will be obligated to pay an additional approximately $
2.1
 million to the former owners.
Altor BioScience, LLC
In connection with our 2017 acquisition of Altor, we issued CVRs under which we agreed to pay the prior stockholders of Altor approximately $
304.0
 million of contingent consideration upon calendar-year worldwide net sales of ANKTIVA exceeding $
1.0
 billion prior to December 31, 2026, with amounts payable in cash or shares of our common stock or a combination thereof. As the transaction was recorded as an asset acquisition, future CVR payments will be recorded when the corresponding events are probable of achievement, or the consideration becomes payable. As of December 31, 2024, Dr. Soon-Shiong, our Founder, Executive Chairman and Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer, and his related party hold approximately $
139.8
 million of net sales CVRs, and they have both irrevocably agreed to receive shares of the company’s common stock in satisfaction of their CVRs. We may be required to pay the other prior Altor stockholders up to $
164.2
 million for their net sales CVRs should they choose to have their CVRs paid in cash instead of common stock. 
Litigation
From time to time, we may be involved in various claims and legal proceedings relating to claims arising out of our operations. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. If we are served with any such complaints, we will assess at that time any contingencies for which we may need to reserve. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.

Altor BioScience, LLC Litigation
In 2017, NantCell announced it had entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Altor. An action captioned 
Gray v. Soon-Shiong, et al.
 was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by plaintiffs Clayland Boyden Gray (Gray) and Adam R. Waldman. The plaintiffs, two minority stockholders, asserted claims against the company and other defendants for (1) breach of fiduciary duty and (2) aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty and filed a motion to enjoin the merger. The court denied the motion and permitted the merger to close. 
Subsequent to the close of the merger, in 2017 the plaintiffs (joined by two additional minority stockholders, Barbara Sturm Waldman and Douglas E. Henderson (Henderson)) filed a second amended complaint, including appraisal claims, and which the defendants subsequently moved to dismiss. In a second action, Dyad Pharmaceutical Corporation (Dyad) filed a petition in the Delaware Court of Chancery for appraisal in connection with the merger. The defendants moved to dismiss the appraisal petition in 2018. The court issued an oral ruling in 2019 that dismissed certain claims and dismissed Altor from the action. The following claims remained: (a) the appraisal claims by all plaintiffs and Dyad (against Altor BioScience, LLC), and (b) Henderson’s claims for breach of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty. 
In 2019, the court issued a written order implementing its ruling on the defendants’ motions (the Implementing Order). In the Implementing Order, the court confirmed that all fiduciary duty claims brought by Gray, both individually and as trustee of the Gordon Gray Trust f/b/o C. Boyden Gray, were dismissed. The plaintiffs then moved for leave to file a third amended complaint to add two former Altor stockholders as plaintiffs and a fiduciary duty claim on behalf of a purported class of former Altor stockholders, which the defendants opposed. 
In 2020, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion, and the plaintiffs filed the third amended complaint. In 2020, the defendants answered the third amended complaint and asserted counterclaims against the plaintiffs. The defendants sought damages for attorneys’ fees and costs incurred as a result of the breaches of “standstill” agreements and of stockholder releases. The plaintiffs filed an answer denying the counterclaims and asserting defenses. 
The shares of the former Altor stockholders seeking appraisal met the definition of dissenting shares under the merger agreement and were not entitled to receive any portion of the merger consideration at the closing date, given that those shares were the subject of the above-described appraisal claims. 
In late March 2022, the company agreed to the terms of a settlement with the appraisal petitioners, without any admission of liability or fault. The settlement provided that in exchange for complete releases, the appraisal petitioners, who as a group held 
3,167,565
 dissenting Altor shares, collectively would receive an aggregate of 
2,229,296
 shares of the company’s common stock issued in a private placement, plus an aggregate of $
21.13
 in cash in lieu of fractional shares. The company’s Board of Directors approved the settlement and stock issuance in April 2022, and the court approved the settlement and dismissed the appraisal petitioners’ claims on July 9, 2022. On July 9, 2022, the company issued 
2,229,296
 shares of its common stock with an aggregate market value of $
10.7
 million, based on the closing price of its common stock on the Nasdaq as of July 8, 2022, to the appraisal petitioners pursuant to the court-approved settlement agreement. 
In late April 2022, the company also agreed to the terms of a settlement with the putative class plaintiffs without any admission of liability or fault. In exchange for class-wide releases, the company committed to make a settlement payment of $
5.0
 million in cash by December 31, 2022. On December 8, 2022, the Delaware Court of Chancery entered a final judgment approving the settlement, and the company timely made the $
5.0
 million settlement payment.
Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. Litigation
Sorrento, derivatively on behalf of NANTibody, filed an action in the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles County (the Superior Court) against the company’s subsidiary NantCell, Dr. Soon-Shiong, and Charles Kim. The action alleged that the defendants improperly caused NANTibody to acquire IgDraSol from NantPharma and sought to have the transaction undone and the purchase amount returned to NANTibody. In 2019, we filed a demurrer to several causes of action alleged in the Superior Court action, and Sorrento filed an amended complaint, eliminating Mr. Kim as a defendant and dropping the causes of action we had challenged in our demurrer. Trial had been set to commence in Sorrento’s Superior Court action on August 7, 2023, but on July 24, 2023 the Superior Court vacated the August 7, 2023 trial date at the parties’ request in light of the pending settlement discussed below.

s
Also in 2019, the company and Dr. Soon-Shiong filed cross-claims in the Superior Court action against Sorrento and its Chief Executive Officer Henry Ji, asserting claims for fraud, breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, tortious interference with contract, unjust enrichment, and declaratory relief. Our claims alleged that Dr. Ji and Sorrento breached the terms of an exclusive license agreement between the company and Sorrento related to Sorrento’s antibody library and that Sorrento did not perform its obligations under the exclusive license agreement. The Superior Court ruled that the company’s claims should be pursued in arbitration and that Dr. Soon-Shiong’s claims could be pursued in Superior Court.
In 2019, the company, along with NANTibody, filed an arbitration against Sorrento and Dr. Ji asserting our claims relating to the exclusive license agreement. Sorrento filed counterclaims against the company and NANTibody in the arbitration. The hearings in the NANTibody arbitration commenced in April 2021 and concluded in early August 2021. After post-hearing briefing was concluded, the parties were notified on November 30, 2021 that the arbitrator in the NANTibody arbitration had passed away. A substitute arbitrator was appointed on February 25, 2022, and the parties worked with the substitute arbitrator to conclude the proceedings. Additional hearing sessions were held in May and July 2022, and summations took place on August 2, 2022. 
On December 2, 2022, the arbitrator issued a final award finding that Sorrento had breached the two exclusive license agreements with NantCell and NANTibody. The arbitrator awarded NantCell approximately $
156.8
 million and NANTibody approximately $
16.7
 million, plus post-award interest accruing at a daily rate. On December 21, 2022, NantCell and NANTibody filed petitions in the Superior Court to confirm the arbitration award; on January 16, 2023, Sorrento filed a response to the petitions and moved to vacate the award. On February 7, 2023, after a hearing, the Superior Court entered orders confirming the arbitration award and denying Sorrento’s motion to vacate. The Superior Court entered judgments against Sorrento in the aggregate amount of approximately $
176.4
 million plus 
10
% post-judgment interest, of which approximately $
159.4
 million was payable to NantCell, and the remainder of which was payable to NANTibody. On February 13, 2023, Sorrento informed counsel to the company that it had filed a Chapter 11 proceeding in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, 
In re: Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc., et al.,
 Case No. 23-90085 (DRJ), Docket Entry 810. 
On June 6, 2023, Sorrento filed a motion in its Chapter 11 proceeding for entry of an order approving and implementing a mediation settlement reached with the company and other entities. The settlement involved two possible scenarios: Either, if Sorrento were to raise an amount needed to pay its debtor in possession lender and its unsecured creditors by August 31, 2023, Sorrento would pay those obligations, including the judgments held by NantCell and NANTibody, by 2:00 p.m. ET on August 31, 2023 and be free to proceed with pending litigation; or, failing that, the judgments would be released, the litigation claims would be released, including, without limitation, the Superior Court action discussed above, Sorrento would relinquish its interests in NANTibody and certain other entities, Sorrento would forfeit its rights to any payments from NantCell arising out of its antibody exclusive license agreement with NantCell (rights to PD-L1), and certain other provisions not impacting the company would be implemented as described in the motion. On August 14, 2023, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas issued an order approving the settlement described above, such that the settlement became binding on the parties. As of 2:00 p.m. ET on August 31, 2023, Sorrento had not paid the judgments held by NantCell and NANTibody. Accordingly, in relevant part to the company and NantCell, a mutual release of claims became effective such that the aforementioned judgments were released, the litigation claims were released including, without limitation, the derivative litigation against NantCell described above, Sorrento relinquished its interests in NANTibody, and Sorrento forfeited its rights to any payments from NantCell arising out of its antibody exclusive license agreement with NantCell, including any royalties associated with the company’s engineered NK cell therapy in Phase 2 clinical trials, PD-L1 t-haNK. As a result of the settlement, the parties filed dismissals of the litigation matters discussed above. After the settlement, the company’s ownership in NANTibody increased from 
60
% to 
100
%, and, as a result, the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest of $
4.2
 million was adjusted and recognized in 
additional paid-in capital
 attributable to the company, on the consolidated statement of stockholders’ deficit. 
Shenzhen Beike Biotechnology Co. Ltd. Arbitration
In 2020, we received a Request for Arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce, International Court of Arbitration. The arbitration relates to a license, development, and commercialization agreement that Altor entered into with Beike in 2014, which agreement was amended and restated in 2017, pursuant to which Altor granted to Beike an exclusive license to use, research, develop and commercialize products based on ANKTIVA in China for human therapeutic uses. In the arbitration, Beike is asserting a claim for breach of contract under the license agreement. Among other things, Beike alleges that we failed to 
195
Table of Conten
t
s
use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Beike materials and data related to ANKTIVA. Beike is seeking specific performance and declaratory relief for the alleged breaches. On September 25, 2020, the parties entered into a standstill and tolling agreement (standstill agreement) under which, among other things, the parties affirmed they will perform certain of their obligations under the license agreement by specified dates and agreed that all deadlines in the arbitration are indefinitely extended. The standstill agreement could be terminated by any party on ten calendar days’ notice, and upon termination, the parties had the right to pursue claims arising from the license agreement in any appropriate tribunal. On March 20, 2023, we terminated the standstill agreement, and on April 11, 2023, Beike served an amended Request for Arbitration. We served an Answer and Counterclaims on May 19, 2023. Beike served a Reply to our counterclaims on June 21, 2023. Beike served its Statement of Claim on March 22, 2024, and the company served its Statement of Defense and Counterclaim on June 21, 2024, and Beike served its Statement of Defense to the Counterclaim on August 2, 2024. After the parties completed discovery, Beike served its Reply and Defense to Counterclaim on January 17, 2025. The hearing in the arbitration is scheduled to begin on June 9, 2025. Given that the proceeding is in the pre-hearing stages, it remains too early to evaluate the likely outcome of the case or to estimate any range of potential loss. We believe the claims asserted against the company lack merit and intend to defend the case, and to pursue our counterclaims, vigorously.
Securities Class Action
On June 30, 2023, a putative securities class action complaint, captioned 
Salzman v. ImmunityBio, Inc. et al.
, No. 3:23-cv-01216-GPC-VET, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against the company and three of its officers and/or directors, asserting violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Stemming from the company’s disclosure on May 11, 2023 that it had received an FDA CRL stating, among other things, that it could not approve the company’s BLA for its then product candidate, ANKTIVA with BCG for the treatment of adult patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with CIS with or without papillary tumors, in its present form due to deficiencies related to its pre-license inspection of the company’s third-party CMOs, the complaint alleges that the defendants had previously made materially false and misleading statements and/or omitted material adverse facts regarding its third-party CMOs and the prospects for regulatory approval of the BLA. The complaint did not specify the amount of damages being sought. On September 27, 2023, the court appointed a lead plaintiff, approved their selection of lead counsel, and re-captioned the case 
In re ImmunityBio, Inc. Securities Litigation,
 No. 3:23-cv-01216. On November 17, 2023, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which named the same defendants and asserted the same claims as the previous complaint. On January 8, 2024, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On June 20, 2024, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the motion to dismiss. On July 16, 2024, the lead plaintiff notified the court that he would proceed with his current pleading, and the defendants answered the complaint on August 29, 2024. On January 25, 2025, following a mediation and the parties’ agreement in principle to settle the securities class action for $
10.5
 million, the lead plaintiff filed an unopposed motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement. The settlement is subject to preliminary and final approval by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. A preliminary approval hearing is scheduled for March 7, 2025.
As a result of the foregoing, the company recorded legal settlement expense of $
10.5
 million in 
selling, general and administrative expense,
 on the consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2024 and a corresponding amount in 
accrued expenses and other liabilities
, on the consolidated balance sheet. The company believes that approximately $
6.0
 million of this amount will be paid by the company’s insurers, which will be recorded upon receipt. 
To the extent the court does not grant final approval of the settlement described above, the company is unable to estimate a range of loss, if any, that could result were there to be an adverse final decision in this action. In this event and if an unfavorable outcome were to occur, it is possible that the impact could be material to the company’s results of operations in the period(s) in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable.
Van Luven, Barbieri and Shin Derivative Actions
On October 29, 2024, a shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against the members of our Board of Directors and certain officers, captioned 
Van Luven v. Soon-Shiong et al.
, Case No. 3:24-cv-02014-GPC-VET. The plaintiff purports to bring the action derivatively on behalf of ImmunityBio, and ImmunityBio is a nominal defendant to the action. Stemming from the company’s May 11, 2023 disclosure that it had received an FDA CRL stating, among other things, that it could not approve the company’s BLA for its then product candidate, ANKTIVA with BCG for the treatment of adult patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with CIS with or without papillary tumors, in its present form due to deficiencies related to its pre-license inspection of the company’s third-party CMOs, the derivative complaint

Table of Conten
t

alleges that the individual defendants authorized or permitted materially false and misleading statements and/or omitted material adverse facts regarding ImmunityBio’s third-party CMOs and the prospects for regulatory approval of the ANKTIVA BLA. The derivative complaint asserts claims for violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act as well as claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets. The derivative complaint seeks unspecified damages on behalf of the company, disgorgement or restitution, declaratory relief, and an award of costs and expenses to the derivative plaintiff, including attorneys’ fees. The court entered an order extending the defendants’ deadline to respond to the complaint to April 18, 2025.
On February 25, 2025, a second shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against certain members of our Board of Directors and certain officers, captioned 
Barbieri v. Soon-Shiong, et al
., Case No. 3:25-cv-00416-AGS-JLB. The plaintiff purports to bring the action derivatively on behalf of ImmunityBio, and ImmunityBio is a nominal defendant in the action. This lawsuit asserts substantially similar claims and allegations as 
Van Luven
. 
On February 26, 2025, a third shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California against certain current and former members of our Board of Directors and certain officers, captioned 
Shin v. Soon-Shiong, et al.
, Case No. 3:25-cv-00423-JAH-DDL. The plaintiff purports to bring the action derivatively on behalf of ImmunityBio, and ImmunityBio is a nominal defendant in the action. This lawsuit asserts substantially similar claims and allegations as Van

Carlson Derivative Action
On November 20, 2024, a shareholder derivative action was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the company’s Founder, Executive Chairman, Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer and principal stockholder, Dr. Soon-Shiong, certain affiliates of Dr. Soon-Shiong, certain other members of management, and members of the company’s Board of Directors who serve on the Board of Directors’ Related Party Transaction Committee, captioned 
Carlson v. Soon-Shiong, et al.,
 Case No. 2024-1195-VCL. The plaintiff purports to bring the action derivatively on behalf of ImmunityBio, and ImmunityBio is a nominal defendant to the action. The plaintiff alleges that the previously disclosed September 2023 financing transactions between the company and Dr. Soon-Shiong and his affiliates were not fair to the company. In particular, the plaintiff alleges that the transactions were timed to benefit Dr. Soon-Shiong and his affiliates during a temporary decline in the company’s stock price, resulting in an artificially low conversion price for certain convertible promissory notes that were among the transactions, when defendants knew the company’s stock price would increase following the company’s imminent resubmission of a BLA for, and the subsequent FDA approval of, ANKTIVA with BCG for the treatment of adult patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with CIS with or without papillary tumors. The complaint alleges that defendants breached their fiduciary duties by entering into these transactions at that time and on those terms, thereby unjustly enriching Dr. Soon-Shiong and his affiliates. The derivative complaint seeks unspecified damages on behalf of the company, corporate governance changes with respect to related-party transactions, and an award of costs and expenses to the derivative plaintiff, including attorneys’ fees. On February 17, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.

The purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future but represent only those items for which we are contractually obligated. The majority of our goods and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. For this reason, these amounts do not provide an indication of our expected future cash outflows related to purchases.

Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement
Revenue Interest Liability
On December 29, 2023, we entered into the RIPA with Infinity and Oberland. Pursuant to the RIPA, Oberland acquired certain initial Revenue Interests from us for a gross purchase price of $
200.0
 million paid on closing, less $
7.5
 million of issuance costs. Oberland had the option to purchase additional Revenue Interests from us in exchange for a $
100.0
 million Second Payment upon satisfaction of certain conditions in the RIPA, including receipt of approval from the FDA of our BLA for ANKTIVA on or before June 30, 2024. 
199
Table of Conten
t
s
On April 22, 2024, the FDA approved our product ANKTIVA and as a result, on May 13, 2024 Oberland purchased additional Revenue Interests from us for a gross purchase price of $
100.0
 million, less $
3.1
 million of issuance costs. The issuance costs incurred are being amortized to interest expense over the estimated term of the debt.
As consideration for the aforementioned payments, Oberland has the right to receive quarterly Revenue Interest Payments from us based on, among other things, a certain percentage of our net sales during such quarter, which are tiered payments ranging from 
4.5
% to 
10.0
% (before funding of the Second Payment, 
3.0
% to 
7.0
%) of the company’s worldwide net sales, excluding those in China. 
If the aggregate Revenue Interest Payments made to Oberland as of December 31, 2029 (Test Date) equal or exceed the Cumulative Purchaser Payments ($
300.0
 million) as of that date, the initially tiered revenue interest rate will be decreased to a single rate of 
2.25
% (before the funding of the Second Payment, 
1.50
%) of the company’s worldwide net sales, excluding those in China. If the aggregate Revenue Interest Payments made to Oberland as of the Test Date are less than the aggregate amount of Cumulative Purchaser Payments as of the Test Date, then following the Test Date the initially tiered revenue interest rate will increase to a rate that, had such increased rate applied during the period from December 29, 2023 through December 31, 2029, it would have resulted in Oberland receiving aggregate Revenue Interest Payments (excluding certain payments detailed in the RIPA) equal to the Cumulative Purchaser Payments as of the Test Date. In addition, if aggregate Revenue Interest Payments made to Oberland as of the Test Date are less than the aggregate amount of Cumulative Purchaser Payments as of the Test Date, then the company must make the True-Up Payment.
Oberland’s rights to receive Revenue Interest Payments under the RIPA shall terminate when Oberland has received payments (including any True-Up Payment) equal to 
195.0
% of the then Cumulative Purchaser Payments unless the RIPA is terminated prior to such date (subject to certain Call/Put Option scenarios as described below). If Oberland has not received total payments (including any True-Up Payment) equal to 
195.0
% of the then Cumulative Purchaser Payments on or before the twelfth anniversary of the RIPA, then the company shall be obligated to pay to Oberland an amount equal to 
195.0
% of the then Cumulative Purchaser Payments less the aggregate payments (including any True-Up Payments) made as of such date.
The company’s obligations under the RIPA are guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries meeting materiality thresholds set forth in the RIPA. To secure the company’s obligations under the RIPA and the subsidiary guarantors’ obligations under the guarantees, each of the company and the subsidiary guarantors has granted a security interest in substantially all its assets, subject to certain exceptions and limitations. 
The RIPA contains affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, including covenants and restrictions that, among other things, restrict our ability to incur additional liens, incur additional indebtedness, make loans and investments, enter into transactions with affiliates, engage in mergers and acquisitions, engage in asset sales and exclusive licensing arrangements, and declare dividends to our stockholders, in each case, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the RIPA. As of December 31, 2024, the company was in compliance with all covenants. 
The RIPA is considered a sale of future revenues and is accounted for as long-term debt recorded at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The company imputes interest expense associated with this liability using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is calculated based on the rate that would enable the debt to be repaid in full over the anticipated life of the arrangement. The interest rate on this liability may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors, including the level of forecasted net sales. The company evaluates the interest rate quarterly based on its current net sales forecasts utilizing the prospective method. A significant increase or decrease in actual or forecasted net sales may materially impact the revenue interest liability, interest expense, other income, and the time period for repayment. 
On December 10, 2024, the company entered into an amendment to the RIPA to add additional conditions to the payment of certain existing indebtedness. Such amendment did not have an impact on the valuation of the revenue interest liability or the embedded derivative liabilities related to the RIPA.
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded $
39.7
 million and $
0.3
 million of interest expense, respectively, related to this arrangement.

Embedded Derivative Liabilities
Under the RIPA, the company has a Call Option to terminate the RIPA and repurchase the Revenue Interests at any time upon advance written notice, subject to certain limitations set forth in the RIPA. Additionally, Oberland has a Put Option enabling them to terminate the RIPA and to require the company to repurchase the Revenue Interests upon enumerated events, such as a bankruptcy event, failure to make a payment, an uncured material breach, default in certain third-party agreements, a breach or default under any subordination agreements with respect to indebtedness to existing stockholders, or subordinated notes during certain time periods, judgments in excess of certain amounts against the company, a material adverse effect, the loss of regulatory approval of our product candidates or a change of control. 
The required purchase price with respect to the Call Option and/or Put Option, as applicable, shall be (a) 
120.0
% of the Cumulative Purchaser Payments as of such date, if Oberland exercises the Put Option (other than in connection with a change of control) on or prior to the first anniversary the Closing Date, (b) 
135.0
% of the Cumulative Purchaser Payments as of such date, if the Put Option or the Call Option is exercised in connection with a change of control on or prior to the date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, and (c) in all other cases, (i) 
175.0
% of the Cumulative Purchaser Payments as of such date, if the Put Option or the Call Option is exercised no later than the date that is thirty six (36) months after the Closing Date, and (ii) 
195.0
% of the Cumulative Purchaser Payments as of such date, if the Put Option or the Call Option is exercised later than the date that is thirty six (36) months after the Closing Date, minus, in each case, the total payments made to Oberland on or prior to such date. 
The aforementioned Call and Put Options are considered embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation as a single compound derivative instrument. The company estimated the fair value of the derivative liability using a “with-and-without” method. The “with-and-without” methodology involves valuing the whole instrument on an as-is basis and then valuing the instrument without the individual embedded derivative. The difference between the entire instrument with the embedded derivative compared to the instrument without the embedded derivative is the fair value of the derivative liability. 
The company recorded $
34.5
 million for the initial fair value of the derivative liability upon the closing of the initial $
200.0
 million Revenue Interests acquired by Oberland. The company recorded an incremental $
6.2
 million for the fair value of the derivative liability upon the closing of the additional $
100.0
 million Revenue Interests acquired by Oberland in May 2024. The initial and incremental fair value allocated to the derivative liability is recorded against the RIPA as a debt discount, which is being amortized in 
interest expense,
 on the consolidated statement of operations over the expected term of the debt using the effective interest method. The embedded derivative is subsequently remeasured at fair value each reporting period, with the change in fair value being recorded in

, on the consolidated statement of operations.

The estimated probability and timing of underlying events triggering the exercisability of the Put Option contained in the RIPA, forecasted cash flows and the discount rate are significant unobservable inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of the entire instrument with the embedded derivative. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the discount rate used for valuation of the derivative liability was

Stock Purchase and Option Agreement
In connection with the RIPA, we entered into an SPOA with Oberland pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of approximately $
10.0
 million of our common stock at $
4.1103
 per share in a private placement. Oberland also had an option to purchase up to an additional $
10.0
 million of our common stock, at a price per share to be determined by reference to the 30-day trailing volume weighted-average price of our common stock calculated from the date of exercise. 
This stock purchase option was classified as a liability estimated at fair value at issuance. The initial $
200.0
 million received pursuant to the RIPA and $
10.0
 million received pursuant to the SPOA were allocated among the resulting financial instruments on a relative fair value basis, with $
197.1
 million allocated to the debt under the RIPA, $
12.0
 million allocated to the common stock issued under the SPOA, and $
0.8
 million allocated to the stock purchase option as of December 31, 2023. 
In April 2024, Oberland exercised part of their option and purchased 
858,990
 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $
5.8208
 per share generating net proceeds of approximately $
4.9
 million. In relation to this transaction, we recorded $
7.6
 million in 
additional paid-in capital,
 on the statement of stockholders’ deficit during the year ended December 31, 2024. Following such exercise, approximately $
5.0
 million remains available for future exercise under the SPOA as of December 31, 2024. 
This stock purchase option is classified in
 accrued expenses and other liabilities
, on the consolidated balance sheet at its fair value and is subsequently remeasured at fair value each reporting period, with the change in fair value being recorded in
 change in fair value of derivative liabilities
, on the consolidated statement of operations.

Mandatory Prepayment Feature
The embedded derivative related to a contingently exercisable prepayment feature, which allows the noteholder to request up to a $
50.0
 million prepayment and accrued interest upon occurrence of a specified transaction (defined in the promissory note) was recorded as a derivative liability on the consolidated balance sheet and measured at fair value prior to the second amended and restated promissory note. The fair value of the derivative liability was determined at each period end using the with-and-without method, which assessed the likelihood and timing of a specified transaction that if triggered could have resulted in a repayment. Changes in the fair value of the derivative liability were reported in 
change in fair value of derivative liabilities
, on the consolidated statement of operations. 
Since the company elected the fair value option to account for the $
505.0
 million December 2024 Promissory Note, the embedded derivative is no longer required to be recorded separately but is considered when estimating the fair value of the $
505.0

Debt Modification and Debt Extinguishments
(1)
August 2022 Debt Extinguishment
On August 31, 2022, the company amended and restated the above fixed-rate notes payables held by Nant Capital, NantWorks, NantMobile and NCSC, which are entities affiliated with Dr. Soon-Shiong. Prior to the amendments and restatements, these notes bore and thereafter continued to bear interest at a per annum rate ranging from 
3.0
% to 
6.0
%, provided that the outstanding principal was and thereafter continued to be due and payable on September 30, 2025, and accrued and unpaid interest was or continued to be payable either upon maturity or, with respect to one of the notes, on a quarterly basis. Prior to the amendments and restatements, the company could and thereafter continued to be able to prepay the outstanding principal (together with accrued and unpaid interest), either in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty and without the prior consent of the noteholder, subject to an advance notice period of at least five business days during which the noteholder could convert the amount requested to be prepaid by the company into shares of the company’s common stock, as part of the amendment and restatement.
The terms of these fixed-rate promissory notes were amended and restated to include a conversion feature that gave each noteholder, at its sole option, at any time (other than when the noteholder is in receipt of a written notice of prepayment from the borrower), the right to convert the entire outstanding principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest due under each note at the time of conversion into shares of the company’s common stock at a price of $
5.67
 per share.

Since all of the above promissory notes were entered into or amended at the same time and with entities under common control, the company determined that the promissory notes were required to be evaluated collectively to accurately capture the economics of the transactions entered in contemplation of each other and contemporaneously. ASC 470-50 provides that a modification or an exchange that adds or eliminates a substantive conversion option as of the conversion date would always be considered substantial and require extinguishment accounting. Accordingly, as a result of the addition of the conversion feature to the fixed-rate promissory notes, the fixed-rate promissory notes and the variable-rate promissory notes were determined to be extinguished given the contemporaneous nature of the amendments. The company performed a valuation of the fixed-rate promissory notes and variable-rate promissory notes before and after amendments. Under this model, the company calculated a gain on extinguishment of $
82.9
 million, representing the difference between the fair value of the new and amended promissory notes and the carrying value of the extinguished debt, net of any unamortized related-party notes discounts plus the cash proceeds from the new promissory note. Since the debt was obtained from entities under common control, such gain was recorded in 
additional paid-in capital
, on the consolidated statement of stockholders’ deficit during the year ended December 31, 2022. Also, the difference between the face values of the new and amended promissory notes (and accrued interest on the date of the amendment) and the fair values of the new and restated promissory notes was recorded as a debt discount to be amortized to interest expense over the remaining term (or until conversion in the case of fixed-rate promissory notes) of the respective promissory notes. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded amortization of related-party notes discounts totaling $
42.4
 million and $
16.3
 million, respectively, in 
interest expense
, on the consolidated statement of operations.
The fair values of the promissory notes without a holder conversion option were estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on market rates available to the company for similar debt at issuance after consideration of default and credit risk and the level of subordination. The fair values of the fixed-rate promissory notes, which were each modified to include a holder conversion option, were determined based on a binomial lattice convertible note model. The analysis involved the construction of various intermediate lattices: stock price tree, conversion value tree, conversion probability tree, and discount rate tree. Since certain of the factors analyzed are considered to be unobservable inputs, both the discounted cash flow model and the lattice model are considered to be Level 3 valuations. Significant unobservable inputs used for the discounted cash flow analysis included market yields from 
18.0
% to 
24.8
% and a risk-free rate of 
4.1
%, and the significant unobservable inputs used for the binomial lattice model included a volatility of 
84.9
%, a market yield of 
17.4
% and a risk-free rate of 
3.5
%.
On December 12, 2022, the company received written notice from NantWorks, the holder of an existing convertible promissory note of NantCell, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company, of its election to convert the NantCell promissory note into shares of the company’s common stock. As of such date, the holder of the NantCell note converted the entire $
56.6
 million of outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest due under the note into 
9,986,920
 shares of the company’s common stock at a price of $
5.67

September 11, 2023 Debt Modification
On September 11, 2023, the company entered into a stock purchase agreement with Nant Capital, NantMobile and NCSC pursuant to which the holders exchanged promissory notes totaling approximately $

Since all of the above promissory notes were entered into or amended at the same time on September 11, 2023 and with entities under common control, the company determined that the promissory notes were required to be evaluated collectively to accurately capture the economics of the transactions entered in contemplation of each other and contemporaneously. Pursuant to ASC 470-50, as the terms of the amendment were not substantially different than the terms of the promissory notes prior to the amendment, the amendment was accounted for as a debt modification. The unamortized debt discounts from the promissory notes are being amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the remaining term of modified promissory notes that are not recorded at fair value using the effective interest rate method. Also, a $
29.6
 million increase in fair value of the embedded conversion feature from the debt modification was accounted for as a debt discount to the $
200.0
 million convertible note that is not recorded at fair value, and a $
1.6
 million increase in fair value of the embedded conversion feature related to the promissory note recorded at fair value was accounted for as interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2023. Such increase in fair values of the embedded conversion features totaling $
31.2
 million has been recorded with a corresponding increase in 
additional paid-in capital
,

on the consolidated statement of stockholders’ deficit.

December 29, 2023 Debt Extinguishment
On December 29, 2023 in connection with the RIPA, the company and Nant Capital entered into an amended and restated promissory note and a letter amendment for the following outstanding promissory notes. Pursuant to the terms of the amended and restated promissory note, the amended $
505.0
 million December 2023 promissory note became comprised of a Tranche 1 with principal amount of $
125.0
 million which was previously the $
125.0
 million August 2022 promissory note before amendment, and a Tranche 2 with principal amount of $
380.0
 million, which was made up of the previous $
300.0
 million December 2021 promissory note, $
50.0
 million December 2022 promissory note and $
30.0
 million June 2023 promissory note. In addition, the amendment allowed Nant Capital, in its sole discretion, to convert all the Tranche 2 principal amount of $
380.0
 million of the amended promissory note into shares of common stock. The conversion price was subsequently determined at $
8.2690
 per share based on the agreement. The maturity date of the amended promissory note was December 31, 2025. Pursuant to the terms of the letter amendment, the maturity date of the $
30.0
 million March 2023 promissory note was extended from December 31, 2024 to December 31, 2025. Also, in connection with the RIPA transaction, all outstanding related-party promissory notes became subordinated to the RIPA payment obligations.

Since all of the above outstanding promissory notes were amended at the same time, with entities under common control, the company determined that the promissory notes were required to be evaluated collectively to accurately capture the economics of the transactions entered in contemplation of each other and contemporaneously. Also, in accordance with ASC 470-50 the company used the debt terms that existed before the September 11, 2023 modification to determine whether the modification was substantially different, as the September 11, 2023 modification was within a year of the transaction, and the promissory notes, at that time, had been modified without being deemed to be substantially different. As the modifications (September 11, 2023 and December 29, 2023 on a cumulative basis) added a substantive conversion feature to the promissory notes, these promissory notes were determined to be extinguished given the contemporaneous nature of the amendments. The company performed a valuation of all the promissory notes before and after amendments. Under this model, the company calculated a loss on extinguishment of $
318.8
 million, representing the difference between the fair value of the amended promissory notes and the carrying value of the extinguished debt, net of any unamortized related-party notes discounts. Since the debt was obtained from entities under common control, such loss was recorded in 
additional paid-in capital.
 In addition, a debt premium totaling $
354.9
 million, calculated as the difference between the fair values of certain promissory notes after modifications and their respective face values, was also recorded in 
additional paid-in capital. 
Collectively, a net gain on debt extinguishment of $
36.1
 million was recorded in 
additional paid-in capital, 
on the consolidated statement of stockholders’ deficit for the year ended December 31, 2023. Also, the difference between face values of certain new and amended promissory notes and their respective fair values of $
53.1
 million was recorded as a debt discount to be amortized as interest expense over the remaining term. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded amortization of related-party notes discounts totaling $
0.5
 million in 
interest expense, 
on the consolidated statement of operations related to the new and amended promissory notes.

In regard to the Tranche 2 principal amount of the $
505.0
 million December 2023 promissory note, the company identified an embedded derivative related to a contingent exercisable prepayment feature of the promissory note, which allowed the noteholder to request up to a $
50.0
 million prepayment of the promissory note and accrued interest upon the occurrence of a specified transaction. After the debt extinguishment, the company concluded that this promissory note was issued at a substantial discount, so the embedded derivative that was contingently exercisable was required to be bifurcated and accounted separately from the debt host instrument. The fair value of the embedded derivative was estimated at $
0.8
 million as of December 31, 2023, using a “with and without” method, which assesses the likelihood and timing of the specified transaction to be triggered and result in a repayment. 
The estimated fair value was computed with the following unobservable assumptions:

The fair value of Tranche 1 principal amount of the amended $
505.0
 million December 2023 promissory note, which had no noteholder conversion option, was estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on market rates available to the company for similar debt at issuance after consideration of default and credit risk and the level of subordination. The fair value of Tranche 2 of the amended promissory note, which was modified to include a noteholder conversion option, was determined based on a binomial lattice convertible note model. The analysis involved the construction of various intermediate lattices: stock price tree, conversion value tree, conversion probability tree, and discount rate tree. Since certain of the factors analyzed were considered to be unobservable inputs, both the discounted cash flow model and the lattice model are considered to be Level 3 valuations. The effective unamortized debt discount rate of the amended Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 principal amount of the $

Debt Extinguishment
On December 10, 2024 in connection with an equity offering, the company and Nant Capital entered into a second amended and restated promissory note. Pursuant to the terms of the second amended and restated promissory note, Tranche 1 of the December 2023 Promissory Note with a principal amount of $
125.0
 million and Tranche 2 of the December 2023 Promissory Note with a principal amount of $
380.0
 million were combined into one convertible promissory note with a principal amount of $
505.0
 million with a maturity date of December 31, 2027. The $
505.0
 million December 2024 Promissory Note bears an interest rate of Term SOFR plus 
8.0
% per annum, payable on a quarterly basis. Pursuant to the terms of the second amended and restated promissory note, the noteholder, in its sole discretion, may convert all of the outstanding principal amount into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $
5.4270
 per share. In addition, the noteholder can request up to $
50.0
 million of the outstanding principal amount and accrued interest to be repaid upon consummation of a specified transaction. Also, on the same date, the company received a written notice from Nant Capital, the holder of the $
30.0
 million March 2023 Promissory Note due on December 31, 2025 and the $
200.0
 million September 2023 Promissory Note due on September 11, 2026 of its election to convert the entire outstanding principal and accrued interests of the such promissory notes into shares of the company’s common stock (the “Converted Promissory Notes”). As of such date, the total outstanding principal amount and accrued and unpaid interests due under the Converted Promissory Notes were converted into shares of the company’s common stock.
Since the $
505.0
 million December 2024 Promissory Note, together with the Converted Promissory Notes, were executed contemporaneously and in contemplation with one another with entities under common control, the company evaluated these transactions collectively as a single unit of account to accurately capture the economics of the transactions. The company determined the fair value of the conversion feature before and after the above transactions to assess whether there is a substantial change in fair value. The company used binomial lattice models for the “with” scenario and discounted cash flow model for the “without” scenario. The company determined that the fair value of the conversion feature before modification is substantially different than the fair value after modification, and as such, these transactions were accounted for as debt extinguishment in accordance with ASC 470-50. Under this model, the company calculated a gain on debt extinguishment of $
10.4
 million, which represents the difference between the: (a) fair value of the December 2024 Promissory Note and the reacquisition price of the Converted Promissory Notes on the date of conversion; and (b) carrying value of the extinguished debt, net of any unamortized related party notes discounts plus, the debt premium previously recognized in 
additional paid-in capital
, on the consolidated statement of stockholders’ deficit as a result of the December 29, 2023 Debt Extinguishment. Since the debt was obtained from entities under common control, such gain on extinguishment was recorded in 
additional paid-in capital
, on the consolidated statement of stockholders’ deficit.

Brink is a related party as our Founder, Executive Chairman and Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer, and our Chief Corporate Affairs Officer and member of our Board of Directors, collectively own more than 50% of Brink’s outstanding shares. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we recognized revenue of an immaterial amount related to this license.
NantBio, Inc. 
In August 2018, we entered into a supply agreement with NCSC, a 100% owned subsidiary of NantBio. Under this agreement, we agreed to supply VivaBioCell’s proprietary GMP-in-a-Box bioreactors and related consumables, made according to specifications mutually agreed to with both companies. The agreement had an initial term of

Stock-Based Compensation
2015 Equity Incentive Plan
In 2015, the Board of Directors adopted, and our stockholders approved, the 2015 Plan. The 2015 Plan, as amended, permits the grant of incentive stock options to the company’s employees, and the grant of non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares to the company’s employees, directors, and consultants. In addition, the number of shares reserved for future grant under the 2015 Plan include shares subject to stock options granted under the 2014 Plan that expire or terminate without having been exercised in full and shares issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2014 Plan that are forfeited to or repurchased by us (provided that the maximum number of shares that may be added to the 2015 Plan pursuant to this provision is approximately 
110,020
 shares as of December 31, 2024). 
As of December 31, 2024, the 2015 Plan is the only equity plan available for grant of equity awards to employees, directors, and consultants of the company. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 
25.4

The expected term was estimated using the average of the contractual term and the weighted-average vesting term of the options. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury’s rates for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with maturities similar to those of the expected term of the award being valued. The expected volatility was estimated based on the historical volatility of our common stock. The assumed dividend yield was based on our expectation of not paying dividends for the foreseeable future.

 years. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the total fair value of RSUs vested was $
14.6
 million, $

Effective as of August 25, 2023, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors granted 
5,727,159
 RSUs to eligible employees of the company, with the intention of retaining such employees (the “retention award”). The retention award vests according to the following schedule: ½ (one-half) was to vest and vested on September 1, 2023 and ½ (one-half) on January 31, 2024, subject to the recipients continuing to be a “service provider” (as defined in the 2015 Plan) through each applicable vesting date. With respect to RSUs granted, compensation cost was measured using the grant date fair value of $
1.65
 per share, the closing price of the company’s common stock on August 25, 2023. 
RSUs awarded to employees and consultants of affiliated companies are accounted for as stock-based compensation in accordance with ASU 2018-07, 
Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718)
, as the compensation was in exchange for continued support or services expected to be provided to the company over the vesting periods under the NantWorks shared services agreement discussed in 
Note 13

“Related-Party Agreements.”
 We have evaluated the associated benefit of these awards to the affiliated companies under common control and determined that the benefit is limited to the retention of their employees. We estimated such benefit at the grant date fair value of $
4.0
 million. During the year ended December 31, 2024, We recorded deemed dividends of $
0.2
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 and $
0.4

Related-Party Warrants
A total of

Income Taxes 
We are subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as income tax in Italy, South Korea, California, and other states. From inception through December 31, 2024, we have not been required to pay U.S. federal and state income taxes because of current and accumulated NOLs. Our federal returns for tax years 2021 through 2023 remain open to examination, and our state returns remain subject to examination for tax years 2020 through 2023. The Italian and South Korean returns for tax years 2019 through 2023 remain open to examination. Carryforward attributes that were generated in years where the statute of limitations is closed may still be adjusted upon examination by the IRS or other respective tax authorities. No income tax returns are currently under examination by taxing authorities. There are no cumulative earnings in our Italian and South Korean subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024 that would be subject to U.S. income tax or foreign withholding tax. We plan to indefinitely reinvest any future earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.

As of December 31, 2024, we have federal NOLs of $

2.1
 billion, and foreign NOLs of $
16.3
 million. Of the $
1.8
 billion in federal NOLs, $
1.4
 billion do not expire and will be able to be used to offset 80% of taxable income in future years. Of the $
2.1
 billion in state NOLs, $
64.3
 million do not expire and will be able to be used to offset 80% of taxable income in future years. The remaining federal NOL carryforwards expire beginning in 2025, the remaining state NOL carryforwards expire beginning in 2025, the South Korean NOL carryforwards expire beginning in 2025, and the Italian NOLs do not expire. 
In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical operating results and the uncertainty of economic conditions, we recorded a valuation allowance of $
777.1
 million and $
648.4
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the valuation allowance increased by $
128.7
 million and $
156.6
 million, respectively, which was mainly driven by losses from which we cannot benefit. The portion of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which subsequently recognized tax benefits will be credited directly to contributed capital is $

Pursuant to Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, annual use of our net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards may be limited in the event a cumulative change in ownership of more than 50% occurs within a three-year period. We have not recognized the deferred tax assets for federal and state NOLs and credits of $
266.5
 million from our deferred tax asset schedules as of December 31, 2024 due to Section 382/383 limitations. There is no impact to tax expense for the derecognition of net operating losses, and federal and state research and development credits due to the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets. 
As of December 31, 2024, we also had federal research tax credit carryforwards of $
55.6
 million and state research tax credits of $
35.7
 million. The federal research tax credit carryforwards expire beginning in 2032 and certain state research tax credit carryforwards expire beginning in 2030. Our California research tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. As of December 31, 2024, we also had federal other tax credits carryforwards of $
1.3
 million and the tax credit carryforwards expire beginning in 2036. 
Net operating losses and tax credits also are limited when there is a SRLY. These rules generally limit the use of the acquired or departing members’ net operating loss and tax credit carryovers to the amount of taxable income such entity contributes to consolidated taxable income. The 80% limitation also applies to SRLY NOL carryovers and tax credits. Therefore, any SRLY NOLs and tax credits will be subject to this limitation, as well as Section 382 and 383 limitations.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we have $
287.5
 million and $
164.6
 million of interest, respectively, that is temporarily disallowed pursuant to Section 163(j) of the Code. This interest can be carried forward indefinitely and will be deductible when the company generates sufficient adjusted taxable income.

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024 is $
16.4
 million that, if recognized, would not impact our income tax benefit or effective tax rate as long as the deferred tax asset remains subject to a full valuation allowance. We do not expect that the unrecognized tax benefits will change within 12 months of December 31, 2024. Due to the existence of the valuation allowance, future changes in our unrecognized tax benefits will not impact our effective tax rate. We have not incurred any material interest or penalties as of the current reporting date with respect to income tax matters.
Inflation Reduction Act of 2022
The IRA, which incorporates a corporate alternative minimum tax, was signed on August 16, 2022. The changes are effective for the tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The new tax will require companies to compute two separate calculations for federal income tax purposes and pay the greater of the new minimum tax or their regular tax liability. The company is not an applicable corporation for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Employee Benefits
Defined Contribution Plan
In December 2015, we adopted a 401(k) Plan covering all employees. The 401(k) Plan allows employees to make pre- and post-tax contributions up to the maximum allowable amount set by the IRS. The company, at its discretion, may make certain contributions to the 401(k) Plan. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we made contributions totaling $
3.0
 million, $
2.8
 million, and $
2.7
 million, respectively, to the 401(k) Plan.
Compensated Absences
Under our vacation policy, salaried employees are provided unlimited vacation leave. Therefore, we do not record an accrual for paid leave related to these employees since we are unable to reasonably estimate the compensated absences that these employees will take.
19.    
Segment Information
We operate in 
one
 business segment, and therefore have 
one
 reportable segment, focused on developing next-generation therapies that bolster the natural immune system while addressing serious unmet needs within urologic and other cancers as well as infectious diseases. Our CEO is the chief operating decision-maker of the company and manages and allocates resources to our operations on a company-wide basis. Consistent with this decision-making process, our CEO uses consolidated, single-segment financial information for purposes of evaluating performance, forecasting future-period financial results, allocating resources, and setting incentive targets. The measure of segment performance is net income (loss) as reflected in the consolidated statement of operations. The CODM uses net income (loss) to allocate resources on a consolidated basis, which enables the CODM to assess both the overall level of resources available and optimize distribution of resources across functions, therapeutic areas, regions and research and development programs in line with our long-term corporate-wide strategic goals. As the company manages its assets on a consolidated basis, the measure of segment assets is total assets, as reflected in the consolidated balance sheet.

ITEM 9.     CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.
None.
ITEM 9A.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives of ensuring that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. There is no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will operate effectively under all circumstances.
Management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. The term “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; and (ii) provide reasonable assurance (a) that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, (b) that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (c) regarding the prevention or timely detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
As of December 31, 2024, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. 
Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm
The effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its attestation report appearing on page 
232
 of this Annual Report under the heading “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm,” which expresses an unqualified opinion concerning the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Management recognizes that a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of ImmunityBio, Inc. and Subsidiaries
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited ImmunityBio, Inc. and Subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, ImmunityBio, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 
(1) pertain to 
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
 (2) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
 (3) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements
.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate
