Item 1A. Risk Factors — Financial Risks — We are subject to a number of restrictive covenants, which may restrict our business and financing activities.”

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we borrowed $305.0 million on the Revolving Facility and repaid $15.0 million of the balance outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we borrowed $40.0 million on the Revolving Facility and repaid $35.0 million of the balance outstanding. We had $226.5 million of availability under the Revolving Facility and had standby letters of credit outstanding of $3.5 million related to security for the payment of claims required by our workers’ compensation insurance program at December 31, 2024.

As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are nearing completion of a syndication and closing process being led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPM”) for the replacement of the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan Facility with a new $1.0 billion, five-year senior secured revolving credit facility and a new $650 million, five-year senior secured term loan with JPM, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders (the “Replacement Credit Facility”). JPM has provided us with a commitment for its allocated amount under the Replacement Credit Facility, and has received commitments from other lenders for the portion of the Replacement Credit Facility that will not be provided by JPM. While we currently expect to close the Replacement Credit Facility promptly after the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such transaction in that timeframe or at all.

Senior Notes

5.500% Senior Notes due 2028

On June 24, 2020, we issued $450.0 million of 5.500% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “5.500% Senior Notes”). The 5.500% Senior Notes mature on July 1, 2028 and bear interest at a rate of 5.500% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year, commencing on January 1, 2021.

5.000% Senior Notes due 2029

On October 14, 2020, we issued $475.0 million of 5.000% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “5.000% Senior Notes”). The 5.000% Senior Notes mature on April 15, 2029 and bear interest at a rate of 5.000% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on April 15, 2021.

The indentures governing the 5.500% Senior Notes and the 5.000% Senior Notes (together, the “Senior Notes”) contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: (i) pay dividends, redeem stock or

The Senior Notes issued by us are guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that guaranteed our obligations under the Credit Facility. The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several.

We may redeem the Senior Notes at our option, in whole or part, at the dates and amounts set forth in the indentures.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

At December 31, 2024, we had standby letters of credit outstanding of $3.5 million related to security for the payment of claims as required by our workers’ compensation insurance program.

Market Risk

Our interest expense is sensitive to changes in market interest rates. Our long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2024 was composed of $917.6 million of fixed-rate debt and $962.5 million of variable-rate debt with interest based on Adjusted Term SOFR plus an applicable margin. Based on our borrowing level at December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would decrease our pretax income on an annual basis by approximately $9.6 million.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In preparing our financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses included in the financial statements. Estimates are based on historical experience and other available information, the results of which form the basis of such estimates. While management believes our estimation processes are reasonable, actual results could differ from our estimates. The following accounting policies are considered critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating performance and involve highly subjective and complex assumptions and assessments:

Revenue and Accounts Receivable

Our revenue is primarily derived from services rendered to patients for inpatient psychiatric and substance abuse care, outpatient psychiatric care and adolescent residential treatment. We receive payments from the following sources for services rendered in our facilities: (i) state governments under their respective Medicaid and other programs; (ii) commercial insurers; (iii) the federal government under the Medicare program administered by CMS and other programs; and (iv) individual patients and clients. We determine the transaction price based on established billing rates reduced by contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors, discounts provided to uninsured patients and implicit price concessions. Contractual adjustments and discounts are based on contractual agreements, discount policies and historical experience. Implicit price concessions are based on historical collection experience.

We derive a significant portion of our revenue from Medicare, Medicaid and other payors that receive discounts from established billing rates. The Medicare and Medicaid regulations and various managed care contracts under which these discounts must be calculated are complex, subject to interpretation and adjustment, and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services provided in our inpatient facilities and cost settlement provisions. Management estimates the transaction price on a payor-specific basis given its interpretation of the applicable regulations or contract terms. The services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates. Additionally, updated regulations and contract renegotiations occur frequently, necessitating regular review and assessment of the estimation process by management.

Settlements under cost reimbursement agreements with third-party payors are estimated and recorded in the period in which the related services are rendered and are adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined. Final determination of amounts earned under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often occurs in subsequent years because of audits by such programs, rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical provisions. In the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for any adjustments and final settlements. However, there can be no assurance that any such adjustments and final settlements will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Our cost report payables were $0.8 million and $9.3 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The net adjustments to estimated cost report settlements resulted in an increase to revenue of $0.2 million, $1.8 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Insurance

We are subject to medical malpractice and other lawsuits due to the nature of the services we provide. A portion of our professional liability risks are insured through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary providing coverage for up to $7.0 million per claim and $10.0 million for certain other claims through August 31, 2024 and $10.0 million per claim, $15.0 million per claim for certain other claims and $25.0 million for certain batched claims thereafter. We have obtained reinsurance coverage from a third-party to cover claims in excess of those limits. The reinsurance policy has a coverage limit of $78.0 million or $75.0 million in the aggregate for certain other claims through August 31, 2024 and $80.0 million or $75.0 million in the aggregate for certain other claims thereafter. Our reinsurance receivables are recognized consistent with the related liabilities and include known claims and any incurred but not reported claims that are covered by current insurance policies in place. The reserve for professional and general liability risks was estimated based on historical claims, prior settlements and judgments, industry trends, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accrual for professional and general liabilities could be significantly affected should current and future occurrences differ from historical claim trends and expectations. While claims are monitored closely when estimating professional and general liability accruals, the complexity of the claims and wide range of potential outcomes often hampers timely adjustments to the assumptions used in these estimates. We recorded unfavorable adjustments of $10.1 million and $5.3 million to our estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, relating to the settlement or expected settlement of certain prior year claims. The professional and general liability reserve was $87.5 million at December 31, 2024, of which $12.5 million was included in other accrued liabilities and $75.0 million was included in other long-term liabilities. The professional and general liability reserve was $109.4 million at December 31, 2023, of which $12.5 million was included in other accrued liabilities and $96.9 million was included in other long-term liabilities. We estimate receivables for the portion of professional and general liability reserves that are recoverable under our insurance policies. Such receivable was $9.3 million at December 31, 2024, of which $0.5 million was included in other current assets and $8.8 million was included in other assets, and such receivable was $62.3 million at December 31, 2023, of which $33.6 million was included in other current assets and $28.7 million was included in other assets.

46

Our statutory workers’ compensation program is fully insured with a $0.5 million deductible per accident. The workers’ compensation liability was $30.7 million at December 31, 2024, of which $12.0 million was included in accrued salaries and benefits and $18.7 million was included in other long-term liabilities, and such liability was $26.8 million at December 31, 2023, of which $12.0 million was included in accrued salaries and benefits and $14.8 million was included in other long-term liabilities. The reserve for workers compensation claims was based upon independent actuarial estimates of future amounts that will be paid to claimants. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for workers’ compensation and professional and general liability risk exposures.

Property and Equipment and Other Long-Lived Assets

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which typically range from 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements, three to seven years for equipment and the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements. When assets are sold or retired, the corresponding cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the related accounts and any gain or loss is recorded in the period of sale or retirement. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation expense was $149.6 million, $132.3 million and $117.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The carrying values of long-lived assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events, circumstances or operating results indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If this review indicates that the asset will not be recoverable, as determined based upon the undiscounted cash flows of the operating asset over the remaining useful life, the carrying value of the asset will be reduced to its estimated fair value. Fair value estimates are based on independent appraisals, market values of comparable assets or internal evaluations of future net cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded non-cash property impairment charges of $12.4 million related to the closure of certain facilities, which is included in loss on impairment in the consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded non-cash property impairment charges of $2.0 million related to the closure of certain facilities, which is included in loss on impairment in the consolidated statements of operations.

We performed an impairment review of long-lived assets in the fourth quarter of 2024, 2023 and 2022 and recorded no impairment.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of licenses and accreditations, trade names and certificates of need intangible assets that are not amortized, are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable.

As of our annual impairment test on October 1, 2024, we had one reporting unit, behavioral healthcare services. The fair value of our behavioral healthcare services reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore no impairment was recorded.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded non-cash indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $3.5 million related to the closure of certain facilities, which is included in loss on impairment in the consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded non-cash indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $5.4 million related to the closure of certain facilities, which is included in loss on impairment in the consolidated statements of operations.

Income Taxes

We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of deferred taxes on these temporary differences is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, as applicable, based on tax rates and laws in the respective tax jurisdiction enacted as of the balance sheet date.

We review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, applicable tax strategies, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

We have accruals for taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities. We accrue for tax contingencies when it is more likely than not that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated. Although management believes that the positions taken on previously

47

filed tax returns are reasonable, we nevertheless have established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken by us resulting in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. These amounts are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect our potential liability for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax audits, additional exposure based on current calculations, identification of new issues, release of administrative guidance, or rendering of a court decision affecting a particular tax issue.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL 
CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at December 31, 2024 based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (COSO). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2024.

Our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been audited by the independent registered public accounting firm of Ernst & Young LLP. Reports of the independent registered public accounting firm, including the independent registered public accounting firm’s report on our internal control over financial reporting, are included in this report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST
ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of

Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST
ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Revenue Recognition

Description of the Matter

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $3.2 billion of revenue from continuing operations. As discussed in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company determines the transaction price for services to patients based on established billing rates reduced by contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors, discounts provided to uninsured patients and implicit price concessions. Contractual adjustments and discounts are based on contractual agreements, discount policies and historical experience. Implicit price concessions are based primarily on historical collection experience.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

Auditing the Company’s revenue recognition and its estimates of contractual adjustments, discounts and implicit price concessions was complex and judgmental due to the significant data inputs and subjective assumptions utilized in estimating the related amounts. Various reimbursement programs under which these amounts must be estimated are complex and subject to interpretation and adjustment. Additionally, updated regulations and contract renegotiations occur frequently, necessitating regular review and assessment of the estimation process by management.

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s revenue recognition, including controls over key data inputs to the contractual adjustment, discount and implicit price concession estimates and management’s review and consideration of retrospective analyses of historical expected cash collections compared to subsequent actual collections.

F-
4

To test the revenue recognized, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing the validity of a sample of revenue transactions and the completeness and accuracy of data inputs to the estimates of contractual adjustments, discounts and implicit price concessions, including payor contractual terms and historical collection experience. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates based on subsequent collection experience and used the assessment as a source of potential corroborative or contrary evidence supporting management’s assumptions of future collections of existing accounts receivable.

Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated 
Financial Statements

December 31, 2024

1. Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
Description of Business
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to “Acadia,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” mean Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. is a holding company whose direct and indirect subsidiaries own and operate acute inpatient psychiatric facilities, specialty treatment facilities, comprehensive treatment centers (“CTCs”), residential treatment centers and facilities providing outpatient behavioral healthcare services to serve the behavioral healthcare and recovery needs of communities throughout the United States (the “U.S.”) and Puerto Rico. At December 31, 2024, these subsidiaries operated 
262
 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 
11,850
 beds in 
39
 states and Puerto Rico. The terms “facilities,” “centers,” “clinics,” and “hospitals” refer to entities owned, operated, or managed by subsidiaries of Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. References herein to “employees” refer to employees of subsidiaries of Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc.
Basis of Presentation
The business of the Company is conducted through limited liability companies, partnerships and C-corporations. The Company’s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries controlled by the Company through its direct or indirect ownership of majority interests and exclusive rights granted to the Company as the controlling member of an entity. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The majority of the Company’s expenses are “cost of revenue” items. Costs that could be classified as general and administrative expenses include the Company’s corporate office costs, which were $
156.8
 million, $
153.3
 million and $
124.3
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years to conform to the current year presentation.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. At times, cash and cash equivalent balances may exceed federally insured limits. Management believes that the Company mitigates any risks by depositing cash and investing in cash equivalents with major financial institutions.
Insurance
The Company is subject to medical malpractice and other lawsuits due to the nature of the services the Company provides. A portion of the Company’s professional liability risks are insured through a wholly-owned insurance subsidiary providing coverage for up to $
7.0
 million per claim and $
10.0
 million for certain other claims through August 31, 2024 and $
10.0
 million per claim, $
15.0
 million per claim for certain other claims and $
25.0
 million for certain batched claims thereafter. The Company has obtained reinsurance coverage from a third-party to cover claims in excess of those limits. The reinsurance policy has a coverage limit of $
78.0
 million or $
75.0
 million in the aggregate for certain other claims through August 31, 2024 and $
80.0
 million or $
75.0
 million in the aggregate for certain other claims thereafter. The Company’s reinsurance receivables are recognized consistent with the related liabilities and include known claims and any incurred but not reported claims that are covered by current insurance policies in place. The reserve for professional and general liability risks was estimated based on historical claims, prior settlements and judgments, industry trends, severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accrual for professional and general liabilities could be significantly affected should current and future occurrences differ from historical claim trends and expectations. While claims are monitored closely when estimating professional and general liability accruals, the complexity of the claims and wide range of potential outcomes often hampers timely adjustments to the assumptions used in these estimates. The Company recorded unfavorable adjustments of $
10.1
 million and $
5.3
 million to its estimated liability for self-insured professional and general liability claims during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, relating to the settlement or expected settlement of certain prior year claims. The professional and general liability reserve was $
87.5
 million at December 31, 2024, of which $
12.5
 million was included in other accrued liabilities and $
75.0
 million was included in other long-term liabilities. The professional and general liability reserve was $
109.4
 million at December 31, 2023, of which $
12.5
 million was included in other

F-
10

accrued liabilities and $
96.9
 million was included in other long-term liabilities. The Company estimates receivables for the portion of professional and general liability reserves that are recoverable under the Company’s insurance policies. Such receivable was $
9.3
 million at December 31, 2024, of which $
0.5
 million was included in other current assets and $
8.8
 million was included in other assets, and such receivable was $
62.3
 million at December 31, 2023, of which $
33.6
 million was included in other current assets and $
28.7
 million was included in other assets.
The Company’s statutory workers’ compensation program is fully insured with a $
0.5
 million deductible per accident. The workers’ compensation liability was $
30.7
 million at December 31, 2024, of which $
12.0
 million was included in accrued salaries and benefits and $
18.7
 million was included in other long-term liabilities, and such liability was $
26.8
 million at December 31, 2023, of which $
12.0
 million was included in accrued salaries and benefits and $
14.8
 million was included in other long-term liabilities. The reserve for workers compensation claims was based upon independent actuarial estimates of future amounts that will be paid to claimants. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for workers’ compensation and professional and general liability risk exposures.
Property and Equipment and Other Long-Lived Assets
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which typically range from 
10
 to 
50 years
 for buildings and improvements, 
three
 to 
seven years
 for equipment and the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements. When assets are sold or retired, the corresponding cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the related accounts and any gain or loss is recorded in the period of sale or retirement. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation expense was $
149.6
 million, $
132.3
 million and $
117.8
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
The carrying values of long-lived assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events, circumstances or operating results indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If this review indicates that the asset will not be recoverable, as determined based upon the undiscounted cash flows of the operating asset over the remaining useful life, the carrying value of the asset will be reduced to its estimated fair value. Fair value estimates are based on independent appraisals, market values of comparable assets or internal evaluations of future net cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2024
, the Company recorded non-cash property impairment charges of $
12.4
 million related to the closure of certain facilities, which is included in loss on impairment in the consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended 
December 31, 2023
, the Company recorded non-cash property impairment charges of $
2.0
 million related to the closure of certain facilities, which is included in loss on impairment in the consolidated statements of operations.
The Company performed an impairment review of long-lived assets in the fourth quarter of 2024, 2023 and 2022
 and recorded no impairment.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

The Company’s goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consist of licenses and accreditations, trade names and certificates of need intangible assets that are not amortized, are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit may not be recoverable.

As of the Company’s annual impairment test on October 1, 2024
, the Company had 
one
 reporting unit, behavioral healthcare services. The fair value of the Company’s behavioral healthcare services reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore 
no

impairment
 was recorded.

During the year ended December 31, 2024
, the Company recorded non-cash indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $
3.5
 million related to the closure of certain facilities, which is included in 
loss on impairment
 in the consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended 
December 31, 2023
, the Company recorded non-cash indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $
5.4
 million related to the closure of certain facilities, which is included in 
loss on impairment
 in the consolidated statements of operations.

Stock Compensation
The Company measures and recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718, “ 
Compensation — Stock Compensation
.” The Company uses the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine grant-date fair value for stock options and recognizes straight-line amortization of share-based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the respective awards. The fair values of performance stock units are determined based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the trading date immediately prior to the grant date for units subject to performance conditions.

F-
11

Earnings Per Share
Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated in accordance with FASB ASC 260, “
Earnings Per Share
,” based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding in each period and dilutive stock options and non-vested shares, to the extent such securities have a dilutive effect on earnings per share.
Income Taxes
The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of deferred taxes on these temporary differences is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, as applicable, based on tax rates and laws in the respective tax jurisdiction enacted as of the balance sheet date.
The Company reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, applicable tax strategies, and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
The Company has accruals for taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities. The Company accrues for tax contingencies when it is more likely than not that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated. Although management believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable, the Company nevertheless has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken by the Company resulting in additional liabilities for taxes and interest. These amounts are reviewed as circumstances warrant and adjusted as events occur that affect the Company’
s potential liability for additional taxes, such as lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, conclusion of tax audits, additional exposure based on current calculations, identification of new issues, release of administrative guidance, or rendering of a court decision affecting a particular tax issue.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280) 
(“ASU 2023-07”)
 “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.”
 ASU 2023-07 is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and the interim periods within the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted and applied retrospectively. The Company 
adopted

ASU 2023-07
 for the year ended 
December 31, 2024
. See Note 22 
—
 Segments for additional information on the Company’s accounting for segment reporting. There is 
no significant impact
 on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 “

(“ASU 2023-09”)
 “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures Topic 740.
” ASU 2023-09 is intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

“Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40) 
(“ASU 2024-03”)
.”
 ASU 2024-03 requires disaggregated disclosure of certain income statement expenses. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted and must be applied prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

3. Revenue
Revenue is primarily derived from services rendered to patients for inpatient psychiatric and substance abuse care, outpatient psychiatric care and residential treatment. The services provided by the Company have no fixed duration and can be terminated by the patient or the facility at any time, and therefore, each treatment is its own stand-alone contract.
Services ordered by a healthcare provider in an episode of care are not separately identifiable and therefore have been combined into a single performance obligation for each contract. The Company recognizes revenue as its performance obligations are completed. The performance obligation is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of

the healthcare services provided. For inpatient services, the Company recognizes revenue equally over the patient stay on a daily basis. For outpatient services, the Company recognizes revenue equally over the number of treatments provided in a single episode of care. Typically, patients and third-party payors are billed within several days of the service being performed or the patient being discharged, and payments are due based on contract terms.
As the Company’s performance obligations relate to contracts with a duration of one year or less, the Company elected the optional exemption in ASC 606-10-50-14(a). Therefore, the Company is not required to disclose the transaction price for the remaining performance obligations at the end of the reporting period or when the Company expects to recognize the revenue. The Company has minimal unsatisfied performance obligations at the end of the reporting period as the Company’s patients typically are under no obligation to remain admitted in the Company’s facilities.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, estimated implicit price concessions of
 $
75.5
 million and $
68.3
 million, respectively, had been recorded as reductions to the Company’s accounts receivable balances to enable the Company to record its revenues and accounts receivable at the estimated amounts the Company expected to collect.

The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by service type and by payor.
The Company’s facilities and services provided by the facilities can generally be classified into the following categories: acute inpatient psychiatric facilities; specialty treatment facilities; CTCs; and residential treatment centers.
Acute inpatient psychiatric facilities.
 Acute inpatient psychiatric facilities provide a high level of care in order to stabilize patients that are either a threat to themselves or to others. The acute setting provides 24-hour observation, daily intervention and monitoring by psychiatrists.
Specialty treatment facilities
. Specialty treatment facilities include residential recovery facilities and eating disorder facilities. The Company provides a comprehensive continuum of care for adults with addictive disorders and co-occurring mental disorders. Inpatient, including detoxification and rehabilitation, partial hospitalization and outpatient treatment programs give patients access to the least restrictive level of care.
Comprehensive treatment centers. 
CTCs specialize in providing medication-assisted treatment in an outpatient setting to individuals addicted to opioids such as opioid analgesics (prescription pain medications).
Residential treatment centers
. Residential treatment centers treat patients with behavioral disorders in a non-hospital setting. The facilities balance therapy activities with social, academic and other activities.
The table below presents total revenue attributed to each category (in thousands):

The Company receives payments from the following sources for services rendered in its facilities: (i) state governments under their respective Medicaid and other programs; (ii) commercial insurers; (iii) the federal government under the Medicare program administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and other programs; and (iv) individual patients and clients.

The Company determines the transaction price based on established billing rates reduced by contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors, discounts provided to uninsured patients and implicit price concessions. Contractual adjustments and discounts are based on contractual agreements, discount policies and historical experience. Implicit price concessions are based on historical collection experience. Most of the Company’s facilities have contracts containing variable consideration. However, it is unlikely a significant reversal of revenue will occur when the uncertainty is resolved, and therefore, the Company has included the variable

F-
13

consideration in the estimated transaction price. Subsequent changes resulting from a patient’s ability to pay are recorded as bad debt expense, which is included as a component of other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Bad debt expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was not significant.
The Company derives a significant portion of its revenue from Medicare, Medicaid and other payors that receive discounts from established billing rates. The Medicare and Medicaid regulations and various managed care contracts under which these discounts must be estimated are complex, subject to interpretation and adjustment, and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms for different types of services provided in the Company’s facilities and cost settlement provisions. Management estimates the transaction price on a payor-specific basis given its interpretation of the applicable regulations or contract terms. The services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are often subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from the Company’s estimates. Additionally, updated regulations and contract renegotiations occur frequently, necessitating regular review and assessment of the estimation process by management.
Settlements under cost reimbursement agreements with third-party payors are estimated and recorded in the period in which the related services are rendered and are adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined. Final determination of amounts earned under the Medicare and Medicaid programs often occurs in subsequent years because of audits by such programs, rights of appeal and the application of numerous technical provisions. In the opinion of management, adequate provision has been made for any adjustments and final settlements. However, there can be no assurance that any such adjustments and final settlements will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. The Company’s cost report payables were $
0.8
 million and $
9.3
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The net adjustments to estimated cost report settlements resulted in an increase to revenue of $
0.2
 million, $
1.8
 million and $
0.1
 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
The Company provides care without charge to patients who are financially unable to pay for the healthcare services they receive based on Company policies and federal and state poverty thresholds. Such amounts determined to qualify as charity care are not reported as revenue. The cost of providing charity care services were $
9.2
 million, $
8.2
 million and $
6.4
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The estimated cost of charity care services was determined using a ratio of cost to gross charges determined from the Company’s most recently filed Medicare cost reports and applying that ratio to the gross charges associated with providing charity care for the period.
The following table presents revenue by payor type and as a percentage of revenue for the

 million shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the 
years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, respectively, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. 
For the year ended 
December 31, 2023, approximately 
0.9
 million outstanding shares of restricted stock and shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock option awards have been excluded in the calculation of weighted-average shares outstanding-diluted. These shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share in the consolidated statement of operations because the net loss for December 31, 2023
 causes such securities to be anti-dilutive.

5. Acquisitions

The Company’s acquisition strategy is to acquire and develop behavioral healthcare facilities and improve operating results within its facilities and its other behavioral healthcare operations.

On February 22, 2024, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Turning Point Centers (“Turning Point”), a 76-bed specialty provider of substance use disorder and primary mental health treatment services that supports the Salt Lake City, Utah, metropolitan market. Turning Point provides a full continuum of treatment services, including residential, partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient services.
On November 7, 2022, the Company acquired four CTCs located in Georgia from Brand New Start Treatment Centers.

9. Leases
The Company’s lease portfolio primarily consists of finance and operating real estate leases integral for facility operations. The original terms of the leases typically range from 
five
 to 
thirty years
 with optional renewal periods. A minimal portion of the Company’s lease portfolio consists of non-real estate leases, including copiers and equipment, which generally have lease terms of 
one
 to 
three years
 and have insignificant lease obligations.
The Company elected the accounting policy practical expedients by class of underlying asset in ASC 842 “Leases” to: (i) combine associated lease and non-lease components into a single lease component; and (ii) exclude recording short-term leases as right-of-use assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Non-lease components, which are not significant overall, are combined with lease components.
Operating lease liabilities are recorded at the present value of remaining lease payments not yet paid for the lease term discounted using the incremental borrowing rate associated with each lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets represent operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepayments, accrued lease payments, lease incentives and initial direct costs. Certain of the Company’s leases include renewal or termination options. Calculation of operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities include the initial lease term unless it is reasonably certain a renewal or termination option will be exercised. Variable components of lease payments fluctuating with a future index or rate, as well as those related to common area maintenance costs, are not included in determining lease liabilities and are expensed as incurred. Most of the Company’s leases do not contain implicit borrowing rates, and therefore, incremental borrowing rates were calculated based on information available at the lease commencement date. The Company reviews service agreements for embedded leases and records right-of-use assets and liabilities as necessary.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded non-cash operating lease right-of-use asset impairment charges of $
1.4
 million related to the closure of certain facilities, which is included in loss on impairment in the consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded non-cash operating lease right-of-use asset impairment charges of $
2.4
 million related to the closure of certain facilities, which is included in loss on impairment in the consolidated statements of operations.

10. The CARES Act

As part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), the U.S. government announced it would offer $
100
 billion of relief to eligible healthcare providers. The Company accounts for government grants by analogizing to the grant model in accordance with International Accounting Standard 20, 
Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance
, and as such, has recognized income from grants in line with the recognition of expenses or the loss of revenues for which the grants are intended to compensate. The Company recognizes grants once both of the following conditions are met: (i) the Company is able to comply with the relevant terms and conditions of the grant and (ii) the grant will be received.

The Company has participated in certain relief programs offered through the CARES Act, including receipt of funds relating to the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (“PHSSE Fund”), also known as the Provider Relief Fund, and the American Rescue Plan (“ARP”) Rural Payments for Hospitals. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded $
21.5
 million of income from provider relief fund related to ARP funds received. During the year ended 
December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $
6.4
 million of income from provider relief fund related to ARP funds received and repaid the remaining balance of ARP funds to eliminate the liability.

Healthcare providers were required to sign an attestation confirming receipt of the PHSSE Fund amounts and agree to the terms and conditions of payment. Under the terms and conditions for receipt of the payment, the Company was allowed to use the funds to cover lost revenues and healthcare costs related to the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19 (“COVID-19”), and the Company was required to properly and fully document the use of these funds to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The reporting of these funds is subject to future audit for compliance with the terms and conditions. The Company recognized PHSSE Fund amounts to the extent it had qualifying COVID-19 expenses or lost revenues as permitted under the terms and conditions.  

11. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company is, from time to time, subject to various claims, lawsuits, governmental investigations and regulatory actions, including claims for damages for personal injuries, medical malpractice, overpayments, breach of contract, securities law violations, tort and employment related claims. In these actions, plaintiffs request a variety of damages, including, in some instances, punitive and other types of damages that may not be covered by insurance. In addition, healthcare companies are subject to numerous investigations by various governmental agencies. Certain of the Company’s individual facilities have received, and from time to time, other facilities may receive, subpoenas, civil investigative demands, audit requests and other inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. These investigations can result in repayment obligations and violations of the federal False Claims Act can result in substantial monetary penalties and fines, the imposition of a corporate integrity agreement and exclusion from participation in governmental health programs. In addition, the False Claims Act permits private parties to bring qui tam, or “whistleblower,” suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government. Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions.
Desert Hills
From October 2018 to August 2020, the Company, its subsidiary Youth and Family Centered Services of New Mexico (“Desert Hills”), and FamilyWorks, a not-for-profit treatment foster care program to which Desert Hills provided management services, including day-to-day administration of the program, via a management services agreement, were among a number of defendants named in five lawsuits (collectively, the “Desert Hills Litigation”) filed in New Mexico State District Court (the “District Court”). These lawsuits each related to abuse by a foster parent, Clarence Garcia, that occurred in foster homes where FamilyWorks had placed children. In 2021, the Company finalized out-of-court settlements for two of the five cases for amounts covered under the Company’s professional liability insurance: 
Dorsey, as Guardian ad Litem of M.R. v. Clarence Garcia, et al.
 (the “M.R. case”), and 
Higgins, as Guardian ad Litem of J.H. v. Clarence Garcia, et al
 (the “J.H. case”). While the plaintiffs in those two cases had claims pending against FamilyWorks, and FamilyWorks had raised claims or potential claims against the Company, the parties in each of those cases finalized settlements that resolved all claims between FamilyWorks and the Company. The District Court approved the settlement in the J.H. case on June 10, 2024 and the settlement in the M.R. case on August 12, 2024.
On July 7, 2023, in connection with one of the lawsuits in the Desert Hills Litigation styled 
Inman v. Garcia, et al., Case No. D-117-CV-2019-00136
 (the “Inman Litigation”), a jury awarded the plaintiff compensatory damages of $
80.0
 million and punitive damages of $
405.0
 million. This award far exceeded the Company’s reasonable expectation based on the previously resolved complaints and far exceeded any precedent for comparable cases.
On October 30, 2023, the Company and Desert Hills entered into settlement agreements in connection with the Inman Litigation, as well as two other related cases – 
Rael v. Garcia, et al., Case No. D-117-CV-2019-00135
 and 
Endicott-Quinones v. Garcia, et al., Case No. D-117-CV-2019-00137
 (together with the Inman Litigation, the “Cases”).
The 
settlement agreements for the Cases were approved by the District Court in December 2023 and fully resolve each of the Cases with no admission of liability or wrongdoing by either the Company or Desert Hills. On January 19, 2024, pursuant to the

F-
19

terms 
of the settlement agreements, the Company paid an aggregate amount of $
400.0
 million in exchange for the release and discharge of all claims arising from, relating to, concerning or with respect to all harm, injuries or damages asserted in the Cases or that may be asserted in the future by the plaintiffs in the Cases.
On January 30, 2024, a sixth lawsuit styled 
CNRAG, Inc. as Legal Guardian of A.C. v. Garcia et al., No. D-117-CV-2024-00045
 was filed in the District Court alleging similar claims as the previous five lawsuits in the Desert Hills Litigation. The ward in this sixth lawsuit was referenced in prior criminal charges against Garcia in January 2019; however, prior to this lawsuit, neither the ward nor guardian made contact with the Company about a possible claim. The Company determined that a lawsuit from this plaintiff was unlikely because no claims had ever been asserted and the statute of limitations had expired. Plaintiff’s allegations assert certain claims, which, if true, may toll the statute of limitations. At this time, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of the ultimate liability, if any, in connection with this sixth lawsuit. No additional victims are referenced in the prior criminal charges against Garcia.
Securities Litigation
On April 1, 2019, a consolidated complaint was filed against the Company and certain former and current officers in the lawsuit styled 
St. Clair County Employees’ Retirement System v. Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:19-cv-00988
, which is pending in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The complaint is brought on behalf of a class consisting of all persons (other than defendants) who purchased securities of the Company between April 30, 2014 and November 15, 2018, and alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. On September 30, 2022, the court entered an order certifying a class consisting of all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock of the Company between April 30, 2014 and November 15, 2018.
On October 16, 2024, a putative class action complaint was filed against the Company and certain former and current officers in the lawsuit styled 
Kachrodia v. Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:24-cv-01238
, which is pending in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The complaint is brought on behalf of a putative class consisting of all persons (other than defendants) who purchased or otherwise acquired publicly traded securities of the Company between February 28, 2020 and September 26, 2024, and alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. On October 21, 2024, an amended putative class action complaint was filed, asserting the same claims but expanding the proposed class period to October 18, 2024. On October 29, 2024, a putative class action complaint was filed against the Company and certain former and current officers in the lawsuit styled 
Dyar v. Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:24-cv-01300
, which is pending in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The complaint is brought on behalf of a putative class consisting of all persons (other than defendants) who purchased or otherwise acquired publicly traded securities of the Company between February 28, 2020 and October 18, 2024, and alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. On December 3, 2024, the 
Kachrodia
 and 
Dyar
 cases were consolidated. On December 10, 2024, a putative class action complaint was filed against the Company and certain former and current officers in the lawsuit styled 
City of Fort Lauderdale Police and Firefighters Retirement System v. Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. et al., Case No. 3:24-cv-01447
, which is pending in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The complaint is brought on behalf of a putative class consisting of all persons (other than defendants) who purchased or otherwise acquired publicly traded securities of the Company between February 8, 2020 and October 30, 2024, and alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. A joint motion is pending to consolidate the 
City of Fort Lauderdale
 case with the 
Kachrodia
 and

At this time, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of the ultimate liability, if any, in connection with these derivative actions.
Government Investigation
In the fall of 2017, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the “OIG”) issued subpoenas to three of the Company’s facilities requesting certain documents from January 2013 to the date of the subpoenas. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida issued a civil investigative demand to one of the Company’s facilities in December 2017 requesting certain documents from November 2012 to the date of the demand. In April 2019, the OIG issued subpoenas relating to six additional facilities requesting certain documents and information from January 2013 to the date of the subpoenas. In June 2023, the State of Nevada issued a subpoena relating to one of the same facilities as part of the same investigation. The government’s investigation of each of these facilities (collectively, the “2017 OIG/DOJ Investigation”) focused on claims not eligible for payment because of alleged violations of certain regulatory requirements relating to, among other things, medical necessity, admission eligibility, discharge decisions, length of stay and patient care issues. On September 23, 2024, the Company entered into a civil settlement agreement with the federal government (the “2017 OIG/DOJ Settlement Agreement”), which fully resolved the 2017 OIG/DOJ Investigation with no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company. During the year ended December 31 2024, pursuant to the 2017 OIG/DOJ Settlement Agreement, the Company paid $
19.9
 million, plus interest, to the federal government and four states that participated in the 2017 OIG/DOJ Investigation in exchange for the release and discharge of any civil or administrative monetary claims arising from the 2017 OIG/DOJ Investigation.
In September 2024, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri (the “W.D.Mo.”), issued by attorneys from the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ Criminal Division”), related to the Company’s acute care service line and related admissions, length of stay and billing practices. In addition, Lakeland Hospital Acquisition, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, also received a grand jury subpoena from W.D.Mo. on the same day regarding similar subject matter. The Company had also received requests in September 2024 for information on similar subject matter from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, which were withdrawn in the same month. The investigation is being led by attorneys from the DOJ Criminal Division. The DOJ Criminal Division withdrew its subpoenas in October 2024, then re-issued subpoenas regarding the same subject matter in December 2024.  The DOJ Criminal Division is leading and coordinating the efforts from a number of federal agencies and departments investigating such issues, any of which might later make their own requests for information. The Company has also received subpoenas from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) requesting similar information as well as information relating to the CTC service line. The Company is currently conducting a comprehensive internal investigation using external advisors, but, at this time, no findings or conclusions have been made. The Company is fully cooperating with authorities, including active engagement with the DOJ Criminal Division and the SEC. At this time, the Company cannot speculate on whether the outcome of these investigations will have any impact on its business or operations and cannot reasonably estimate the amount or range of the ultimate liability, if any, in connection with these investigations.
Certain members of the United States Congress have requested, and such members or other members may in the future request, information from or about the Company related to, among other things, the Company’s admissions, length of stay, billing practices, and opioid treatment programs. The Company intends to cooperate with any such request. At this time, the Company cannot speculate on the outcome or duration of any such inquiries.

Credit Facility
On March 17, 2021, the Company entered into a credit agreement (as amended the “Credit Facility”), which provided for a $
600.0
 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”) and a senior secured term loan facility in an initial principal amount of $
425.0
 million (as increased by the Incremental Term Loans (as defined below), the “Term Loan Facility”), each maturing on 
March 17, 2026
. The Revolving Facility further provides for a $
20.0
 million subfacility for the issuance of letters of credit.

On March 30, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Facility (the “First Amendment”), which replaced the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), as the reference rate applicable to borrowings under the Credit Facility with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as determined for a term of, at the Company’s option, one, three or six months, plus an adjustment of 
0.10
% (“Adjusted Term SOFR”). After giving effect to the First Amendment, borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Company’s option, either (i) Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin ranging from 
1.375
% to 
2.250
% or (ii) a base rate plus a margin ranging from 
0.375
% to 
1.250
%, in each case, depending on the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility). In addition, an unused fee that varies according to the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of the Company ranging from 
0.200
% to 
0.350
% is payable quarterly in arrears based on the average daily undrawn portion of the commitments in respect of the Revolving Facility.

On January 18, 2024, the Company entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Facility (the “Second Amendment”), which provided for the incurrence of additional senior secured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $
350.0
 million (the “Incremental Term Loans”). Such Incremental Term Loans are structured as an increase of the Term Loan Facility. The maturity date, the leverage-based pricing grid, mandatory prepayment events and other terms applicable to the Incremental Term Loans are substantially identical to those applicable to the initial $
425.0
 million 
term loans incurred under the Term Loan Facility. After

F-
22

giving 
effect to the Incremental Term Loans, the Credit Facility requires quarterly principal repayments for the Term Loan Facility of approximately $
15.4
 million for March 31, 2025 and $
20.5
 million for each quarter ending from June 30, 2025 to December 31, 2025. The remaining outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan Facility is due on the maturity date of 
March 17, 2026
.
The Company has the ability to increase the amount of the Credit Facility, which may take the form of increases to the Revolving Facility or the Term Loan Facility or the issuance of one or more incremental term loan facilities (collectively, the “Incremental Facilities”), upon obtaining additional commitments from new or existing lenders and the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent for such Incremental Facilities. Such Incremental Facilities may not exceed the sum of (i) the greater of $
480.0
 million and an amount equal to 
100
% of the consolidated EBITDA of the Company at the time of determination (the “Incremental Fixed Basket”) and (ii) additional amounts that would not cause the Company’s Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) to exceed 
3.5
 to 1.0 (the “Incremental Ratio Basket”). The Incremental Term Loans were incurred in reliance on the Incremental Ratio Basket, leaving the full amount of the Incremental Fixed Basket available for any future Incremental Facilities.
Subject to certain exceptions, substantially all of the Company’s existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries are required to guarantee the repayment of the Company’s obligations under the Credit Facility. The Company and such guarantor subsidiaries have granted a security interest in substantially all personal property assets as collateral for the obligations under the Credit Facility.
The Credit Facility contains customary representations and affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt, grant or permit additional liens, make investments and acquisitions, merge or consolidate with others, dispose of assets, pay dividends and distributions, pay junior indebtedness and enter into affiliate transactions, in each case, subject to customary exceptions. In addition, the Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company on a consolidated basis to maintain, as of the last day of any consecutive four fiscal quarter period, a Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of not more than 
4.5
 to 1.0 (which may be increased to 
5.0
 to 1.0 for a period of up to four consecutive fiscal quarters following the consummation of certain material acquisitions) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) of at least 
3.0
 to 1.0. The Credit Facility also includes events of default customary for facilities of this type and upon the occurrence of such events of default, among other things, all outstanding loans under the Credit Facility may be accelerated, the lenders’ commitments terminated, and/or the lenders may exercise collateral remedies. At 
December 31, 2024
, the Company’s Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio was 
2.7
x, and the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company borrowed $
305.0
 million on the Revolving Facility and repaid $
15.0
 million of the balance outstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company borrowed $
40.0
 million on the Revolving Facility and repaid $
35.0
 million of the balance outstanding. The Company had $
226.5
 million of availability under the Revolving Facility and had standby letters of credit outstanding of $
3.5
 million related to security for the payment of claims required by its workers’ compensation insurance program at December 31, 2024.

As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company is nearing completion of a syndication and closing process being led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPM”) for the replacement of the Revolving Facility and the Term Loan Facility with a new $
1.0
 billion, 
five
-year senior secured revolving credit facility and a new $
650
 million, 
five
-year senior secured term loan with JPM, as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders (the “Replacement Credit Facility”). JPM has provided the Company with a commitment for its allocated amount under the Replacement Credit Facility, and has received commitments from other lenders for the portion of the Replacement Credit Facility that will not be provided by JPM. While the Company currently expects to close the Replacement Credit Facility promptly after the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete any such transaction in that timeframe or at all.
Senior Notes
5.500% Senior Notes due 2028
On June 24, 2020, the Company issued $
450.0
 million of 
5.500
% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “
5.500
% Senior Notes”). The 5.500% Senior Notes mature on 
July 1, 2028
 and bear interest at a rate of 5.500% per annum,

5.000% Senior Notes due 2029
On October 14, 2020, the Company issued $
475.0
 million of 
5.000
% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “
5.000
% Senior Notes”). The 5.000% Senior Notes mature on 
April 15, 2029
 and bear interest at a rate of 
5.000
% per annum, 
payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing on April 15, 2021
.
The indentures governing the 5.500% Senior Notes and the 5.000% Senior Notes (together, the “Senior Notes”) contain covenants that, among other things, limit the Company’s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to: (i) pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions or investments; (ii) incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; (iii) transfer or

F-
23

sell assets; (iv) engage in certain transactions with affiliates; (v) create restrictions on dividends or other payments by the restricted subsidiaries; (vi) merge, consolidate or sell substantially all of the Company’s assets; and (vii) create liens on assets.
The Senior Notes issued by the Company are guaranteed by each of the Company’s subsidiaries that guarantee the Company’s obligations under the Credit Facility. The guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several.
The Company may redeem the Senior Notes at its option, in whole or part, at the dates and amounts set forth in the applicable indentures.
Debt Issuance Costs

14. Noncontrolling Interests
Noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements represent the portion of equity held by noncontrolling partners in the Company’s non-wholly owned subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the Company operated 
11
 facilities through non-wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company owns between approximately 
65
% and 
87
% of the equity interests of these entities and noncontrolling partners own the remaining equity interests. The initial value of the noncontrolling interests is based on the fair value of contributions. The Company consolidates the operations of each facility based on its status as primary beneficiary, as further discussed in Note 15 
—
 Variable Interest Entities. The noncontrolling interests are reflected as redeemable noncontrolling interests on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based on put rights that could require the Company to purchase the noncontrolling interests upon the occurrence of a change in control.
The components of redeemable noncontrolling interests are as follows (in thousands):

15. Variable Interest Entities
For legal entities where the Company has a financial relationship, the Company evaluates whether it has a variable interest and determines if the entity is considered a variable interest entity (“VIE”). If the Company concludes an entity is a VIE and the Company is the primary beneficiary, the entity is consolidated. The primary beneficiary analysis is a qualitative analysis based on power and benefits. A reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE and must consolidate the VIE if it has both power and benefits. It must have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE.
At December 31, 2024
, the Company operated 
11
 facilities through non-wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company owns between approximately 
65
% and 
87
% of the equity interests of these entities, and noncontrolling partners own the remaining equity interests. The Company manages each of these facilities, is responsible for the day to day operations and, therefore, has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. These activities include, but are not limited to, behavioral healthcare services, human resource and employment-related decisions, marketing and finance. The terms of the agreements governing each of the Company’s VIEs prohibit the Company from using the assets of each VIE to satisfy the obligations of other entities. Consolidated assets at 
December 31, 2024 and 2023 include total assets of variable interest entities of $
930.9
 million and $
597.8
 million, respectively, which cannot be used to settle the obligations of other entities. Consolidated liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023 include total liabilities of variable interest entities of $
36.8
 million and $
27.0
 million, respectively.

16. Equity
Preferred Stock
The Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that up to 
10,000,000
 shares of preferred stock may be issued. The board of directors has the authority to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to fix for each series the voting powers (full, limited or none), and the designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions on the stock and the number of shares constituting any series and the designations of this series, without any further vote or action by the stockholders.

F-
25

Common Stock
The Company’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that up to 
180,000,000
 shares of common stock may be issued. Holders of the Company’s common stock are entitled to 
one vote for each share
 held of record on all matters on which stockholders may vote. There are no preemptive, conversion, redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to shares of the Company’s common stock. In the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of the Company’s common stock are entitled to share ratably in the assets available for distribution, subject to any prior rights of any holders of preferred stock then outstanding. Delaware law prohibits the Company from paying any dividends unless it has capital surplus or net profits available for this purpose. In addition, the Credit Facility imposes restrictions on the Company’s ability to pay dividends.

17. Equity-Based Compensation
Equity Incentive Plans
The Company issues stock-based awards, including stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units, to certain officers, employees and non-employee directors under the Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. Incentive Compensation Plan (the “Equity Incentive Plan”). At December 31, 2024, a maximum of 
12,700,000
 shares of the Company’s common stock were authorized for issuance as stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units or other share-based compensation under the Equity Incentive Plan, of which 
2,053,112
 w
ere available for future grant. Stock options may be granted for terms of up to 
ten years
. The Company recognizes expense on all share-based awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the entire award. Grants to employees generally vest in annual increments of 
25
% or 
33
% each year, commencing one year after the date of grant. The exercise prices of stock options are equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the most recent trading date prior to the date of grant.
The Company recognized $
37.1
 million, $
32.3
 million and $
29.6
 million in equity-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Stock compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is impacted by forfeiture adjustments and performance stock unit adjustments based on actual performance compared to vesting targets. At December 31, 2024, there was $
71.9
 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested options, restricted stock units and performance stock units, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 
1.1
 years.
The Company recognized a deferred income tax benefit of $
10.1
 million, $
8.8
 million and $
8.0

The Company’s estimate of expected volatility for stock options is based upon the volatility of its stock price over the expected life of the award. The risk-free interest rate is the approximate yield on U. S. Treasury Strips having a life equal to the expected option life on the date of grant. The expected life is an estimate of the number of years an option will be held before it is exercised.

22. Segments
The Company has 
one
 reportable segment, behavioral healthcare services. The behavioral healthcare services segment provides inpatient and outpatient behavioral healthcare services. The Company derives revenue from 
39 states and Puerto Rico and manages business activities on a consolidated basis. Revenue is primarily derived from services rendered to patients for inpatient psychiatric and substance abuse care, outpatient psychiatric care and adolescent residential treatment.

The accounting policies of the behavioral healthcare services segment are described in Note 2 
—
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM assesses performance for the behavioral healthcare services segment and decides how to allocate resources based on earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”). The CODM reviews expenses in a format consistent with the consolidated statements of operations. The measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total assets.

The CODM uses EBITDA to evaluate income generated from segment assets in deciding whether to reinvest assets into the behavioral healthcare services segment or into other parts of the entity, such as for acquisitions or debt reduction. EBITDA is used to monitor budget versus actual results. The CODM also uses EBITDA in competitive analysis by benchmarking to the Company’s competitors. The competitive analysis along with the monitoring of budgeted versus actual results are used in assessing performance of the segment and in establishing management’s compensation. The Company does not have intra-entity sales or transfers.

23. Subsequent Events

On February 25, 2025, the Company’s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program (the “share repurchase program”) pursuant to which the Company may, from time to time, acquire up to $

 million of outstanding shares of its common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases. Repurchases made pursuant to the share repurchase program will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws and may be made at management’s discretion from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or through block trades, derivatives transactions, or purchases made in accordance with Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. The share repurchase program has no termination date and may be modified, suspended or discontinued by the Company’s board of directors at any time. The authorization does not obligate the Company to repurchase any shares.
