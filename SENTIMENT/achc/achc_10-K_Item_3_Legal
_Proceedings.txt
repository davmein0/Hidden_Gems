Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers

On February 25, 2025, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program (the “share repurchase program”) pursuant to which we may, from time to time, acquire up to $300.0 million of outstanding shares of our common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases. Repurchases made pursuant to the share repurchase program will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws and may be made at management’s discretion from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or through block trades, derivatives transactions, or purchases made in accordance with Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The share repurchase program has no termination date and may be modified, suspended or discontinued by our board of directors at any time. The authorization does not obligate us to repurchase any shares.

Dividends

We have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business and to repay indebtedness, and therefore we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Additionally, because we are a holding company, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited by restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make distributions to us, including restrictions under the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to compliance with covenants in current and future agreements governing our indebtedness (including the Credit Facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes), and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.

Overview

Our business strategy is to become the indispensable behavioral healthcare provider for the high-acuity and complex needs patient population. We are committed to providing the communities we serve with high-quality, cost-effective behavioral healthcare services, while growing our business, increasing profitability and creating long-term value for our stockholders. This strategy includes five growth pathways: expansions of existing facilities, joint venture partnerships, de novo facilities, acquisitions and expansion across our continuum of care. At December 31, 2024, we operated 262 behavioral healthcare facilities with approximately 11,850 beds in 39

36

 states and Puerto Rico. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we added 776 beds, consisting of 312 added to existing facilities and 464 added through the opening of four wholly-owned facilities and one joint venture facility, and we opened nine CTCs.

We are the leading publicly traded pure-play provider of behavioral healthcare services in the U.S. Management believes that we are positioned as a leading platform in a highly fragmented industry under the direction of an experienced management team that has significant industry expertise. Management expects to take advantage of several strategies that are more accessible as a result of our increased size and geographic scale, including continuing a national marketing strategy to attract new patients and referral sources, increasing our volume of out-of-state referrals, providing a broader range of services to new and existing patients and clients and selectively pursuing opportunities to expand our facility and bed count through acquisitions, wholly-owned de novo facilities, joint ventures and bed additions in existing facilities.

Acquisitions

On February 22, 2024, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Turning Point, a 76-bed specialty provider of substance use disorder and primary mental health treatment services that supports the Salt Lake City, Utah, metropolitan market. Turning Point provides a full continuum of treatment services, including residential, partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient services.

On November 7, 2022, we acquired four CTCs located in Georgia from Brand New Start.

We believe that we are well positioned to help meet the growing demand for behavioral healthcare services and recorded revenue growth of 7.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Similar with many other healthcare providers and other industries across the country, we have been navigating a tight labor market. While we experienced higher wage inflation compared to historical averages in recent years, we continue to see stability in our labor costs and our proactive focus helps us manage through this environment. We remain focused on ensuring that we have the level of staff to meet the demand in our markets across 39 states and Puerto Rico.

(a)
Results for the periods presented include facilities we have operated more than one year and exclude certain closed services.

(b)
Average length of stay is defined as patient days divided by admissions.

Same facility results include operating results only for facilities and services operated in both the current and prior year. These metrics exclude the operating results associated with facilities under operation for less than one year and facilities acquired during the current or prior year, as well as facilities divested or removed from service, and also exclude general and administrative costs related to our corporate functions. Such costs related to our corporate functions include, amongst others, costs for accounting and finance, information systems, human resources, legal and operational and executive leadership. General and administrative costs directly related to the facilities are included in same facility results. Such costs directly related to our facilities include, amongst others, labor at the facility level, insurance, including property, professional, legal and general liability insurance, hospital supplies, including medication, utilities and food service, and general maintenance costs for the facility. We determine which general and administrative costs to exclude and include in same facility results by ensuring those costs directly associated with facility operations are captured at the facility level for reporting.

We believe that providing results on a same facility basis is helpful to our investors as a measure of our financial and operating performance because it neutralizes the impact of corporate-level items that do not arise out of our core operations at our facilities and because it neutralizes the impact of new facilities that are in early stages of operation and facilities that we no longer operate, each of which may distort investors’ understanding of our underlying performance at our existing and continuing facilities. Further, we believe that providing same facility information is helpful to our investors as a measure of the financial and operating performance of our existing and continuing facilities on a comparable basis, and same facility results metrics provide investors with information useful in understanding underlying organic growth in such facilities. For these reasons, we believe that same facility results are particularly useful during periods of significant expansion or contraction.

Same facility results reflect adjustments that are intended to provide the specific presentation described above and that may be irregular in timing from period to period related to newly opened or acquired facilities or facilities that we no longer operate, and may omit certain results that investors may view as important. Same facility results may therefore not be indicative of the overall performance of our business and should be not be considered as an alternative for net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP.

Year Ended December 31, 2024 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2023

Revenue.
 Revenue increased $225.3 million, or 7.7%, to $3,154.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 from $2,928.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Same facility revenue increased by $220.7 million, or 7.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, resulting from same facility growth in patient days of 3.2%, an increase in same facility revenue per patient day of 4.3% and an increase in same facility admissions of 1.3%. Consistent with the same facility patient day growth in 2023, the growth in same facility patient days for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 resulted from the addition of beds to our existing facilities and ongoing demand for our services.

Same facility SWB expense was $1,491.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, or 48.1% of revenue, compared to $1,393.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, or 48.4% of revenue.

Other operating expenses.
 Other operating expenses consisted primarily of purchased services, utilities, insurance, travel and repairs and maintenance expenses. Other operating expenses were $440.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, or 14.0% of revenue, compared to $388.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, or 13.3% of revenue. Same facility other operating expenses were $408.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, or 13.2% of revenue, compared to $361.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, or 12.6% of revenue.

Income from provider relief fund. 
For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded $6.4 million of income from provider relief fund related to ARP funds received in 2022.

Depreciation and amortization.

 Legal settlements expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $394.2 million associated with the Desert Hills Litigation.

Loss on impairment. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded non-cash impairment charges totaling $17.3 million related to the closure of certain facilities. The non-cash impairment charges included indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments of $3.5 million, property impairments of $12.4 million and operating lease right-of-use asset impairments of $1.4 million.

Provision for (benefit from) income taxes.
 For the year ended December 31, 2024, the provision for income taxes was $77.4 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 22.6%, compared to the benefit from taxes of $(9.7) million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 38.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our higher pre-tax results for the year ended December 31, 2024 yields lower volatility in the items impacting the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 when compared to prior periods.

As we continue to monitor the implications of potential tax legislation in each of our jurisdictions, we may adjust our estimates and record additional amounts for tax assets and liabilities. Any adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities could materially impact our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate in the periods in which they are made.

Year Ended December 31, 2023 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2022

Revenue.
 Revenue increased $318.3 million, or 12.2%, to $2,928.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from $2,610.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Same facility revenue increased by $309.3 million, or 12.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, resulting from same facility growth in patient days of 5.1%, an increase in same facility revenue per day of 6.5% and an increase in the average length of stay of 4.9%. Consistent with the same facility patient day growth in 2022, the growth in same facility patient days for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 resulted from the addition of beds to our existing facilities and ongoing demand for our services.

Our strategic plan does not require the repatriation of foreign cash in order to fund our operations in the U.S.

We actively manage our capital structure and regularly evaluate the availability of capital in the public and private markets that could strengthen our long-term financial profile. As such, we may opportunistically engage in financing transactions from time to time when we believe that conditions are favorable. Such transactions may include borrowings under credit facilities, the issuance of debt, equity or hybrid securities, the incurrence of term loans, or the refinancing or extinguishment of existing indebtedness. There can be no assurance any such financing opportunities will be available to us on terms and conditions acceptable to us or at all.

Share Repurchase Program

On February 25, 2025, our board of directors authorized the share repurchase program pursuant to which we may, from time to time, acquire up to $300.0 million of outstanding shares of our common stock, exclusive of any fees, commissions, or other expenses related to such repurchases. Repurchases made pursuant to the share repurchase program will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws and may be made at management’s discretion from time to time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or through block trades, derivatives transactions, or purchases made in accordance with Rule 10b-18 and Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act. The share repurchase program has no termination date and may be modified, suspended or discontinued by our board of directors at any time.  The authorization does not obligate us to repurchase any shares.

Desert Hills Litigation

As described in more detail in Note 11 
—
 Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements, on October 30, 2023, we entered into settlement agreements in connection with the three lawsuits related to our subsidiary Youth and Family Centered Services of New Mexico. The settlement agreements were approved by the New Mexico State District Court in December 2023 and fully resolved such cases with no admission of liability or wrongdoing by us. On January 19, 2024, pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreements, we paid an aggregate amount of $400.0 million in exchange for the release and discharge of all claims arising from, relating to, concerning or with respect to all harm, injuries or damages asserted in such cases or that may be asserted in the future by the plaintiffs in those cases.

Credit Facility

On March 17, 2021, we entered into the Credit Facility, which provided for a $600.0 million Revolving Facility and a Term Loan Facility in an initial principal amount of $425.0 million, each maturing on March 17, 2026. The Revolving Facility further provides for a $20.0 million subfacility for the issuance of letters of credit.

On March 30, 2023, we entered into the First Amendment, which replaced LIBOR as the reference rate applicable to borrowings under the Credit Facility with Adjusted Term SOFR. After giving effect to the First Amendment, borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either (i) Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin ranging from 1.375% to 2.250% or (ii) a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.375% to 1.250%, in each case, depending on our Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility). In addition, an unused fee that varies according to our Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio ranging from 0.200% to 0.350% is payable quarterly in arrears based on the average daily undrawn portion of the commitments in respect of the Revolving Facility. The interest rates and the unused line fee on unused commitments related to the Credit Facility are based upon the following pricing tiers:

On January 18, 2024, we entered into the Second Amendment, which provided for the incurrence of $350.0 million of Incremental Term Loans. Such Incremental Term Loans are structured as an increase of the Term Loan Facility. The maturity date, the leverage-based pricing grid, mandatory prepayment events and other terms applicable to the Incremental Term Loans are substantially identical to those applicable to the initial $425.0 million term loans incurred under the Term Loan Facility. After giving effect to the Incremental Term Loans, the Credit Facility requires quarterly principal repayments for the Term Loan Facility of approximately $15.4 million for March 31, 2025, and $20.5 million for each quarter ending from June 30, 2025 to December 31, 2025. The remaining outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan Facility is due on the maturity date of March 17, 2026.

We have the ability to increase the amount of the Credit Facility, which may take the form of increases to the Revolving Facility or the Term Loan Facility or the issuance of one or more incremental term loan facilities (collectively, the “Incremental Facilities”), upon obtaining additional commitments from new or existing lenders and the satisfaction of customary conditions precedent for such Incremental Facilities. Such Incremental Facilities may not exceed the sum of (i) the greater of $480.0 million and an amount equal to 100% of the Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility) at the time of determination (the “Incremental Fixed Basket”), and (ii) the additional amounts that would not cause our Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) to exceed 3.5 to 1.0 (the “Incremental Ratio Basket”). The Incremental Term Loans were incurred in reliance on the Incremental Ratio Basket, leaving the full amount of the Incremental Fixed Basket available for any future Incremental Facilities.

Subject to certain exceptions, substantially all of our existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct or indirect wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries are required to guarantee the repayment of our obligations under the Credit Facility. We and such guarantor subsidiaries have granted a security interest in substantially all personal property assets as collateral for the obligations under the Credit Facility.

The Credit Facility contains customary representations and affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt, grant or permit additional liens, make investments and acquisitions, merge or consolidate with others, dispose of assets, pay dividends and distributions, pay junior indebtedness and enter into affiliate transactions, in each case, subject to customary exceptions. In addition, the Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring us on a consolidated basis to maintain, as of the last day of any consecutive four fiscal quarter period, a Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio of not more than 4.5 to 1.0 (which may be increased to 5.0 to 1.0 for a period of up to four consecutive fiscal quarters following the consummation of certain material acquisitions) and a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility) of at least 3.0 to 1.0. The Credit Facility also includes events of default customary for facilities of this type and upon the occurrence of such events of default, among other things, all outstanding loans under the Credit Facility may be accelerated, the lenders’ commitments terminated, and/or the lenders may exercise collateral remedies. At December 31, 2024, our Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio was 2.7x, and we were in compliance with all financial covenants. Total Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is being reported as calculated under the Credit Facility and not pursuant to GAAP. Investors should refer to the agreements governing the Credit Facility attached as exhibits to our periodic reports for further information related to the calculation thereof, and should not consider Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio as an alternative for any measures derived in accordance with GAAP. For risks related to our indebtedness and compliance with these covenants, see “
