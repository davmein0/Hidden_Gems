ITEM 5.            MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
Market Information and Dividends
Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “AEIS.” On January 31, 2025, the number of common stockholders of record was 196. This does not include stockholders whose shares are held in “street name” through brokers or other nominees. 
In each of the four quarters in 2024, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share, totaling $15.4 million for the full year. We currently anticipate that a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, and other factors
.
Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer
To repurchase shares of our common stock, we periodically enter into share repurchase agreements, open market transactions, and/or other transactions in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Before repurchasing our shares, we consider the market price of our common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities, available liquidity, cash flows from operations, general business and economic conditions, and other relevant factors. 
​
We did not repurchase any shares during the fourth quarter of 2024. 
At December 31, 2024, the remaining amount authorized by our Board for future share repurchases was $197.4 million with no time limitation.

ITEM 7.            MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward-looking statements. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in this annual report on Form 10-K for additional factors relating to such statements and see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A for a discussion of certain risks applicable to our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The following section discusses our results of operations for 2024 and 2023 and year-to-year comparisons between those periods.
Company Overview
Advanced Energy provides highly engineered, critical, precision power conversion, measurement, and control solutions to our global customers. We design, manufacture, sell and support precision power products that transform, refine, and modify the raw electrical power coming from either the utility or the building facility and convert it into various types of highly controllable, usable power that is predictable, repeatable, and customizable to meet the necessary requirements for powering a wide range of complex equipment. Many of our products enable customers to reduce or optimize their energy consumption through increased power conversion efficiency, power density, power coupling, and process control across a wide range of applications.
We are organized on a global, functional basis and operate as a single segment of power electronics conversion products. Within this segment, our products are sold into the Semiconductor Equipment, Industrial and Medical, Data Center Computing, and Telecom and Networking markets.
On June 20, 2024, we acquired Airity Technologies, Inc. (“Airity”). This acquisition added high voltage power conversion technologies and products, broadening our range of targeted applications within the Semiconductor Equipment and Industrial and Medical markets. See 
Note 2. Acquisition
 in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Business Environment and Trends
2024 Summary Results and Key Activities
For the year ended December 31, 2024, our revenue was $1,482.0 million, representing a decline of 10.5% as compared to 2023. The decline was attributable to lower revenue from our Industrial and Medical and Telecom and Networking markets due to customer inventory rebalancing, resulting in a lower demand environment. These declines were partially offset by higher revenues in the Semiconductor Equipment market, from the 2023 trough level, and growing AI-related demand in the Data Center Computing market. For more details on the trends in our end markets, see “End Markets Summary and Trends” elsewhere in this Item 7.
In 2024, we reported higher operating expenses of $492.7 million, an increase of $14.0 million primarily attributable to higher stock-based compensation expense, higher research and development (“R&D”) program costs, higher restructuring charges from initiatives focused on optimizing manufacturing and support operations, partially offset by a general workforce reduction to align to our revenue levels. The restructuring actions should largely be completed in 2026 and are expected to enable a more efficient and cost-effective operating structure. 
In the third quarter of 2024, we approved further manufacturing consolidation initiatives, including the closure of our Zhongshan, China manufacturing facility. In connection with the 2024 Plan, we recorded a $29.6 million charge primarily associated with expected employment-related charges and facility exit costs. 
See 
Note 12. Restructuring, Asset Impairments, and Other Charges 
in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Table of Contents
In the third quarter of 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement to increase the capacity on the Revolving Facility from $200.0 million to $600.0 million. This amendment was in connection with the concurrent prepayment, using existing cash on hand, of the full $345.0 million outstanding principal balance under our Term Loan Facility. See 
Note 18. Long-Term Debt
 in Part II, Item 8 “
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
” and Liquidity and Capital Resources below.
During 2024, we continued progress on a new factory near Bangkok, Thailand, which we expect to be operational in 2026.
End Markets Summary and Trends
The demand environment in each of our markets is impacted by macroeconomic conditions, various market trends, customer buying patterns, design wins, and other factors. Although we are currently experiencing a lower demand environment in certain markets, we continue to believe that the long-term market growth drivers support our long-term strategy, research and development efforts, and capital investments. However, in the short-term it is unclear how certain macroeconomic conditions, including the effect of higher interest rates impacting end customers’ capital investment, the timing of inventory digestion, and customer buying patterns, will affect customer demand and our revenue.
Semiconductor Equipment Market
The Semiconductor Equipment market appears to be slowly recovering from a cyclical downturn, which bottomed in 2023. Demand improved in 2024, but a number of external factors continue to limit the market recovery, including unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, prolonged weak demand for consumer electronics, low fab utilization, and U.S. export restrictions to China. 
We continue to believe the long-term growth drivers will support cyclical growth for this market. Growth drivers include more manufacturing capacity needed to support increasing demand for semiconductor devices, increasing etch and deposition process steps with new technology inflections, and the transition to advanced technology nodes requiring higher content of advanced power solutions per tool. In addition, we believe our investment in new products can enable market share gains resulting in higher than market growth. 
Industrial and Medical Market
Beginning in the second half of 2023, the impact of weaker macroeconomic conditions started to lower demand for our products in the Industrial and Medical market. In addition, in the previous two years, many customers built inventories of our products following the supply chain disruption and extended lead times. As lead times normalized in 2024, customers rebalanced their elevated inventory levels resulting in further decline in revenue. We expect these factors will continue to limit our revenue in the near term but believe that growth will return to this market after customer inventories return to normal levels and end markets recover. 
Data Center Computing Market
Revenue in the Data Center Computing market was weak in the first quarter of 2024 driven by reduced investments by our hyperscale customers, lower demand for enterprise systems, and the timing of large customer orders. Starting in the second quarter of 2024, demand rebounded driven by accelerated investments in AI and customers starting to ramp new generations of high power solutions, resulting in revenue growth in 2024. We expect these factors will continue to support strong demand for the next few quarters. 
Telecom and Networking Market
In 2023, improved supply of critical components drove a meaningful increase in revenue, which more than offset weakening market conditions in the Telecom and Networking market. End demand further weakened during 2024. In addition, customers rebalanced their elevated inventory levels as lead times normalized, resulting in a further decline in our revenue. We expect the current market conditions to continue for several quarters.

Total revenue decreased from the same period in the prior year due primarily to lower end demand and customer inventory rebalancing, resulting in lower demand in our Industrial and Medical and Telecom and Networking markets. The Semiconductor Equipment market modestly recovered from the cyclical trough in 2023, and revenue in the Data Center Computing market grew as hyperscale customers increased investments in AI. 
Revenue by Market 
Sales in the Semiconductor Equipment market increased $48.8 million, or 6.6%, to $792.6 million, as compared to $743.8 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to improved demand as we emerge from the cyclical trough in 2023.
Sales in the Industrial and Medical market decreased $158.3 million, or 33.4%, to $316.2 million, as compared to $474.4 million in the prior year. After a record year in 2023, the decrease was primarily due to lower end demand and customers working down their elevated inventories on shortened lead times following the supply chain disruption. 
Sales in the Data Center Computing market increased $34.3 million, or 13.7%, to $284.2 million, as compared to $249.9 million in the prior year. The increase was due to accelerated hyperscale investments in AI and growing adoption of next generation high power solutions. 
Sales in the Telecom and Networking market decreased $98.6 million, or 52.5%, to $89.1 million as compared to $187.7 million in the prior year. The decrease was due to the prior year benefiting from the improved supply of critical components. This enabled fulfillment of outstanding orders in 2023, which did not continue in 2024. In addition, we experienced a slow demand environment and inventory rebalancing at many of our customers, which we expect to continue.

The decrease in gross profit was largely due to the decline in revenue, partially offset by reduction in manufacturing expenses. Gross margin declined mainly due to the impact of lower volume, largely offset by lower manufacturing, material, and other costs of 170 basis points and favorable mix of 150 basis points.

Research and Development
Research and development expenses increased $9.4 million to $211.8 million, as compared to $202.4 million in the prior year. The increase is related to higher stock-based compensation expense as well as higher program and materials costs compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by lower variable compensation. 
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $3.5 million to $224.5 million, as compared to $221.0 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily driven by higher stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by actions taken to control costs, including headcount reduction and lower variable compensation.
Amortization of Intangible Assets
Amortization expense decreased $2.2 million to $26.0 million, as compared to $28.3 million in the prior year. 
Certain intangible assets reached the end of their estimated useful life in the current year. This was partially offset by amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Airity acquisition.

Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other Charges
In the third quarter of 2024, we approved further manufacturing consolidation initiatives, including the closure of our Zhongshan, China manufacturing facility. In connection with the 2024 Plan, we recorded a $29.6 million charge primarily associated with expected employment-related charges and facility exit costs. The amounts incurred as a result of the approved actions are estimates and actual results may differ, which could result in incremental restructuring charges in future periods. We anticipate the 2024 Plan will be substantially completed by the end of second quarter of 2025, with final activities expected to conclude in 2026. 
For additional information about this and prior year restructuring plans, see 
Note 12. Restructuring, Asset Impairments, and Other Charges 
in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
​
Interest Income, Interest Expense, and Other Income (Expense), net
We experienced an increase in interest income on higher cash balances, due in part to proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes in the third quarter of 2023, our ability to concentrate cash in investment accounts, and higher short term market interest rates.
Interest expense increased due to interest associated with the Convertible Notes and a higher interest rate on the portion of our Term Loan Facility subject to a variable interest rate. We prepaid in full the Term Loan Facility on September 9, 2024, and the interest rate swap contracts expired on September 10, 2024. Should we have future borrowings under our Term Loan Facility or Revolving Facility, those borrowings would be subject to a variable rate. 
Other expense, net was $2.0 million in 2024, as compared to $1.8 million of expense in the prior year. Other expense, net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous items. We had unrealized foreign exchange losses during the year 2024 compared to unrealized gains in the prior year. Additionally, in 2024, we incurred costs associated with foreign currency translation adjustments related to liquidated foreign operations and debt discount and fees associated with our Term Loan Facility prepayment. There were no such costs during the same periods in the prior year.

Note 18. Long-Term Debt

​
Our effective tax rates differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, primarily due to the intercompany transfer of intellectual property among certain of our subsidiaries in 2024 and a valuation allowance release in 2023. Additionally, both 2024 and 2023 included the benefit of earnings in foreign jurisdictions which are subject to lower tax rates, as well as tax credits, partially offset by net U.S. tax on foreign operations.
Our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, and the geographic composition of our pre-tax income. We carefully monitor these factors and adjust our effective income tax rate accordingly.
As of January 1, 2024, the Pillar II minimum global effective tax rate of 15% enacted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) was effectuated. More than 140 countries agreed to enact the Pillar II global minimum tax. However, the timing of the implementation for each country varies. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we included an estimate of global minimum tax liability as a result of those countries where we conduct business that have adopted Pillar II. As countries continue to make revisions to their legislation and release additional guidance with respect to the global minimum tax, we continue to determine any potential impact in the countries in which we operate. The impact of these changes may have a material impact on our cash tax expense and tax rate.
Non-GAAP Results
Management uses non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP earnings per share (“EPS”) to evaluate business performance without the impacts of certain non-cash charges and other charges which are not part of our usual operations. We use these non-GAAP measures to assess performance against business objectives, and make business decisions, including developing budgets and forecasting future periods. In addition, management’s incentive plans include these non-GAAP measures as criteria for achievements. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. However, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide additional information that enables readers to evaluate our business from the perspective of management. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
The non-GAAP results presented below exclude the impact of non-cash related charges, such as stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, and long-term unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses. In addition, we exclude discontinued operations and other non-recurring items such as acquisition-related costs, facility expansion and related costs, and restructuring expenses, as they are not indicative of future performance. The tax effect of our non-GAAP adjustments represents the anticipated annual tax rate applied to each non-GAAP adjustment after consideration of their respective book and tax treatments. Finally, non-GAAP results exclude one-time tax benefits and losses associated with changes in our legal entity structure or ownership of certain assets.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
Adequate liquidity and cash generation are important to the execution of our strategic initiatives. Our ability to fund our operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and product development efforts may depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities, which is subject to future operating performance, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. Our primary sources of liquidity continue to be our available cash, cash generated from operations, and available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility (refer to 
Note 18. Long-Term Debt
 in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”). 
As of December 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $722.1 million, and our available funding under our Revolving Facility is $600.0 million. Additionally, we generated $132.9 million of cash flow from continuing operations in 2024. We believe our sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet anticipated debt service, share repurchase programs, and dividends. During the ordinary course of business, we evaluate our cash requirements and, if necessary, adjust our expenditures to reflect the current market conditions and our projected revenue and demand. Our capital expenditures are primarily directed towards manufacturing and operations and can materially influence our available cash for other initiatives.
In addition, we may seek additional debt or equity financing from time to time; however, such additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.
Debt
On September 9, 2024, we used existing cash on hand to prepay the full $345.0 million outstanding principal balance under our Term Loan Facility. On the same date, we entered into an additional amendment to the Credit Agreement to increase the capacity on the Revolving Facility from $200.0 million to $600.0 million. 
As of December 31, 2024, our only outstanding debt is the $575.0 million Convertible Notes, which mature on September 15, 2028 and carry a 2.5% interest rate.
The interest rate swap contracts previously entered into related to the Term Loan Facility expired on September 10, 2024. Should we have future borrowings under our Term Loan Facility or Revolving Facility, those borrowings would be subject to a variable rate.
As of December 31, 2024, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Facility, and we had $600.0 million in available funding. 
In addition to the available capacity on the Revolving Facility, prior to the maturity date of the Credit Agreement, we may request an increase to the financing commitments in either the Term Loan Facility or Revolving Facility by an aggregate amount not to exceed $250.0 million. Any requested increase is subject to lender approval.
For more information see 
Note 18. Long-Term Debt
 in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Dividends
During 2024, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.10 per share, totaling $15.4 million. We currently anticipate that a cash dividend of $0.10 per share will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions, and other factors.

Net Cash From Operating Activities
Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations was $132.9 million, a decrease of $80.0 million, compared to $212.9 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower net income from continuing operations, primarily due to a decline in revenue. Additionally, during the current year, we had a significant use of cash for inventories due to a strategic inventory buildup. In addition, we had net cash usage related to accounts payable, accrued expenses, restructuring payments, and other liabilities.
Net Cash From Investing Activities 
Net cash used in investing activities in 2024 was $73.5 million, an increase of $8.7 million, compared to $64.8 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to our acquisition of Airity for $13.8 million and continued capital investments in our Mexico and Thailand manufacturing facilities.
Net Cash From Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities in 2024 was $377.1 million, compared to a cash inflow of $445.7 million in the prior year. In 2024, we used existing cash on hand to make payments towards our Term Loan Facility for $355.0 million, including $10.0 million in principal payment made in the first half of the year and the September prepayment of the remaining $345.0 million outstanding principal balance, and repurchased common stock for $1.8 million. We do not have any scheduled debt maturities in the next twelve months.

Table of Contents
During 2023, we received $561.1 million net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt from our Convertible Note. In conjunction with the Convertible Note issuance, we also received $74.9 million proceeds from sale of warrants and made a $115.0 million payment for purchase of note hedges. We also repurchased $40.1 million of our common stock. 
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported. 
Note 1. Summary of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates
 in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The accounting positions described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies and estimates require significant judgments and assumptions to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on variability in factors affecting these estimates.
Inventories
We value inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, computed on a first-in, first-out basis. General market conditions, as well as our design activities, can cause certain products to become obsolete and we adjust our inventory carrying value for estimated excess and obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based on projected end-user demand, which is determined by considering historical usage, customer orders and forecast, and qualitative considerations such as market and economic conditions. The determination of projected end-user demand requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to projected unit sales for each product. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. A significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the charges for excess inventory quantities on hand. 
Income Taxes
We follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences. A deferred tax asset or liability is computed for both the expected future impact of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carryforwards. Tax rate changes are reflected in the period such changes are enacted. 
We assess the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. Our assessment includes several factors, including historical results and taxable income projections for each jurisdiction. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent on the generation of taxable income in appropriate jurisdictions during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in determining the amount of the valuation allowance. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, we determine if we will more likely than not realize the benefits of these deductible differences. 
Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity.
For more details see Note 4. Income Taxes in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Table of Contents
Business Combinations
We record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at their acquisition date fair values. Fair values of assets acquired, and liabilities assumed are based upon available information and may involve engaging an independent third party to perform an appraisal. Estimating fair values can be complex and subject to significant business judgment. We must also identify and include in the allocation all acquired tangible and intangible assets that meet certain criteria, including assets that were not previously recorded by the acquired entity. The estimates most commonly involve intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price over the net fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities is recorded as goodwill, which is not amortized but instead is evaluated for impairment at least annually. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, an entity is allowed a reasonable period of time (not to exceed one year) to obtain the information necessary to identify and measure the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination
.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements pursuant to Regulation S-K.
Contractual Obligations

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
From time to time, updates to the Accounting Standards Codification are communicated through issuance of an Accounting Standards Update. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued guidance, whether adopted or to be adopted in the future, is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
To understand the impact of recently issued guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standards setting bodies, whether adopted or to be adopted, please review the information provided in

ITEM 7A.         QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market Risk and Risk Management
In the normal course of business, we have exposures to interest rate risk from our investments and Credit Agreement. We also have exposure to foreign exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations and foreign currency transactions.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates through revenue and purchasing transactions when we sell products and purchase materials in currencies different from the currency in which product and manufacturing costs were incurred. Our reported financial results of operations, including the reported value of our assets and liabilities, are also impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Assets and liabilities of substantially all our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are translated at period end rates of exchange for each reporting period. Operating results and cash flow statements are translated at average rates of exchange during each reporting period. Although these translation changes have no immediate cash impact, the translation changes may impact future borrowing capacity, and overall value of our net assets. 
41

Table of Contents
The functional currencies of our worldwide facilities primarily include the United States Dollar, Euro, South Korean Won, New Taiwan Dollar, Japanese Yen, Pound Sterling, and Chinese Yuan. We are subject to risks associated with revenue and purchasing activities and costs to operate that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies, such as the Singapore Dollar, Malaysian Ringgit, Mexican Peso, Philippine Peso, and Thai Baht. Historically, the impact of changes to these particular exchange rates has not been material to our operating results. 
From time to time, we may enter into foreign currency exchange rate contracts to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities expected to be settled at a future date, including foreign currency, which may be required for a potential foreign acquisition. Market risk arises from the potential adverse effects on the value of derivative instruments that result from a change in foreign currency exchange rates. We may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to manage the exchange rate risk associated with intercompany debt denominated in nonfunctional currencies. We minimize our market risk applicable to foreign currency exchange rate contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of our derivative contract instruments. We enter into derivative contract instruments for risk management purposes only. We do not enter into or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.
Interest Rate Risk
At the present time, a change in interest rates does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow because our only outstanding debt is the Convertible Notes, which carry a fixed 2.5% interest rate. However, increases in interest rates could impact the decision to borrow under our Credit Agreement and our ability to refinance existing maturities or acquire additional debt on favorable terms.

Report of 
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated

statements of operations,

comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes

(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework),

and our report dated February 18, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Inventory valuation 
Description of the Matter
​
As more fully described in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has inventories with a carrying value of $360.4 million as of December 31, 2024. The Company adjusts its inventory carrying value for estimated excess or obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based on projected customer demand, which is determined by considering historical usage, customer orders and forecast, and qualitative considerations such as market and economic conditions.
Auditing management’s inventory valuation was complex and involved judgment because a critical factor in determining excess and obsolete inventory requires management to determine projected customer demand, which could be impacted by future market and economic conditions.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
​
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls related to the Company’s process for evaluating inventory valuation inclusive of controls related to the development of and management’s review of the underlying data, including historical usage and the estimation of projected customer demand.
We evaluated certain inventories for excess or obsolescence by testing key inputs, including historical usage and projected customer demand, and by testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting management’s inventory valuation assessment. Specifically, we compared the Company’s projected customer demand to historical sales and inventory usage. We assessed historical trends of management’s estimates and performed analyses to evaluate management’s excess and obsolete inventory estimates and underlying assumptions. We also performed a retrospective review of the prior year valuation assumptions, including inventory write-off history.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Advanced Energy Industries, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 18, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
46

Table of Contents
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTE 1.           SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
Advanced Energy Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries (“we,” “us,” “our,” “Advanced Energy,” or the “Company”) provides highly engineered, critical, precision power conversion, measurement, and control solutions to our global customers. We design, manufacture, sell and support precision power products that transform, refine, and modify the raw electrical power coming from either the utility or the building facility and convert it into various types of highly controllable, usable power that is predictable, repeatable, and customizable to meet the necessary requirements for powering a wide range of complex equipment. 
Many of our products enable customers to reduce or optimize their energy consumption through increased power conversion efficiency, power density, power coupling, and process control across a wide range of applications
.
In December 2015, we completed the wind down of engineering, manufacturing, and sales of our solar inverter product line. We have continuing involvement with regard to certain warranty obligations. Accordingly, the results of our inverter business are reflected as loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Principles of Consolidation 
Our consolidated financial statements include the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Our consolidated financial statements are stated in United States (“U.S.”) Dollars and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). 
Reclassifications
We reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to the current year presentation. Within the operating activities section of our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we present activity associated with our operating leases separately in the caption “Operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities, net.” Additionally, we separately present “Amortization and write-off of debt issuance costs and debt discount.” Previously the above activity was included within “Other liabilities and accrued expenses.”
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements 
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments include, but are not limited to, excess and obsolete inventory, income taxes and other provisions, and acquisitions and asset valuation.
Segment Information
Our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) is the chief operating decision maker who reviews financial information on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. Accordingly, we determined we operate in a single reporting segment – power electronics conversion products. Within this segment, our products are sold into the Semiconductor Equipment, Industrial and Medical, Data Center Computing, and Telecom and Networking markets. 
Our CEO assesses performance and decides how to allocate resources primarily based on consolidated net income, which is reported on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Total assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represent our segment assets.

Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency of certain of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these foreign subsidiaries are translated to the United States Dollar at prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect for each period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income. 
For certain other subsidiaries, the functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. Foreign currency transactions are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise. Subsequent changes in exchange rates for foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities result in foreign currency transaction gains and losses, which are reflected as unrealized (based on period end remeasurement) or realized (upon settlement of the transactions) in other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Derivatives
We use derivative financial instruments to manage risks associated with foreign currency. Unless we meet specific hedge accounting criteria, changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within other income (expense), net. 
Fair Value
We value certain financial assets and liabilities using fair value measurements. 
U.S. GAAP for fair value establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach, and cost approach). Our financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. The three levels of the hierarchy and the related inputs are as follows:
●
Level 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access on the measurement date.
●
Level 2 — Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
●
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
We categorize fair value measurements within the fair value hierarchy based upon the lowest level of the most significant inputs used to determine fair value. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the fair value of assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.

​
The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities approximate fair value as recorded due to the short-term nature of these instruments. 
Our non-financial assets, which primarily consist of property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, goodwill, and other intangible assets, are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis and are reported at carrying value. However, on a periodic basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be fully recoverable (and at least annually for goodwill), non-financial instruments are assessed for impairment and, if applicable, written down to and recorded at fair value. See 
Note 11. Intangible Assets and Goodwill
 for further discussion and presentation of these amounts.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
We consider all amounts on deposit with financial institutions and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of short-term money market instruments and demand deposits with insignificant interest rate risk. 
In some instances, we invest excess cash in money market funds not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The investments in money market funds are on deposit with credit-worthy financial institutions and the funds are highly liquid. These investments are reported at fair value and included in cash and cash equivalents. 
We classify investments with stated maturities of greater than three months at time of purchase in other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Concentrations of Credit Risk
Financial instruments with potential credit risk include cash and cash equivalents and trade accounts receivable. To preserve capital and maintain liquidity, we invest with financial institutions we deem to be of high quality and sound financial condition. Our investments are in low-risk instruments, and we limit our credit exposure in any one institution or type of investment instrument based upon criteria, including creditworthiness.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (continued)
Allowance for Credit Losses 
We evaluate collection risk and establish expected credit loss primarily through a combination of the following: continuous monitoring of customer credit, analysis of historical aging and credit loss experience, current economic conditions, and customer specific information. 
Our standard payment terms are net 30 days. Certain large volume customers have longer payment terms.

Generally, we do not require collateral from customers.
Inventories
We value inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, computed on a first-in, first-out basis. General market conditions, as well as our design activities, can cause certain products to become obsolete and we adjust our inventory carrying value for estimated excess and obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based on projected end-user demand, which is determined by considering historical usage, customer orders and forecast, and qualitative considerations such as market and economic conditions. The determination of projected end-user demand requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to projected unit sales for each product. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly. A significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the charges for excess inventory quantities on hand. 
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost or estimated fair value if acquired in a business combination. We compute depreciation over the estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. We evaluate the useful life and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset group containing the property and equipment may not be recoverable.
When depreciable assets are retired, or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any related gains or losses are included in other income (expense), net, in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Internal-Use Software Development Costs
We capitalize qualifying costs associated with software applications developed for internal use. We begin capitalization after meeting two criteria: (i) the preliminary project stage is completed and (ii) it is probable that the software will be completed and used for its intended function. We also capitalize costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in significant additional functionality. We cease capitalization when the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, including the completion of all significant testing.
Costs related to preliminary project activities, post-implementation operating activities, maintenance, and minor upgrades are expensed as incurred.
We classify capitalized software development costs within property and equipment, net and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s estimated useful life. Amortization is included in both cost of revenue and operating expenses. We evaluate the useful life and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (continued)
Leases
We lease manufacturing and office space under non-cancelable operating leases. Some of these leases contain provisions for landlord funded leasehold improvements, which we record as a reduction to right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and the related operating lease liabilities. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components, and we combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component. Certain lease agreements may contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the right-of-use lease assets and operating lease liabilities. When renewal options are reasonably certain of exercise, we include the renewal period in the lease term. In many cases, we have leases with a term of less than one year. We elected the practical expedient to exclude these short-term leases from our ROU assets and operating lease liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we negotiate and execute new leases to meet business objectives.
Right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments on the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments. We have a centrally managed treasury function; therefore, we apply a portfolio approach for determining the incremental borrowing rate applicable to the lease term. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We evaluate the useful life and test for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset group containing the right-of-use assets may not be recoverable.
Intangible Assets and Goodwill
Our intangible assets consist of customer relationships, developed technology, trademarks, patents, and intellectual property, which are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Intangible assets, which are considered long-lived assets, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group containing these assets may not be recoverable.
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. We evaluate goodwill for impairment as a single reporting unit annually during the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Our goodwill impairment evaluation consists of a qualitative assessment. If this assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the Company’s estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value of our net assets, we do not consider goodwill to be impaired. Otherwise, we perform a quantitative assessment by comparing the Company’s fair value to the carrying value of our net assets, including goodwill. If the carrying value of our net assets exceeds the fair value, we consider goodwill to be impaired. 
Based on the facts and circumstances, we determine the fair value based on an income, market, or cost approach. Each method is subjective in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which can include projected financial results, discount rates, long-term growth rates, and industry trends.
Debt Issuance Costs
We capitalize costs associated with issuing debt. Depending on the nature of the agreement, we record these costs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets either in other assets or as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt. We amortize the costs over the term of the agreement using the effective interest method. Amortization expense is reflected within interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See 
Note 18.

Revenue Recognition
Net revenue consists of products and support services.
We recognize substantially all revenue at a point in time when we satisfy our performance obligations. Typically, this occurs on shipment of goods because, at that point, we transfer control to our customer. The transaction price is based upon the standalone selling price. In most transactions, we have no obligations to our customers after the date products are shipped, other than pursuant to warranty obligations. We recognize revenue net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Surcharges, cost recoveries, and shipping and handling fees billed to customers, if any, are recognized as revenue. The related cost for shipping and handling fees is recognized in cost of revenue. 
Support services include warranty and non-warranty repair services, upgrades, and refurbishments on the products we sell. Repairs covered under our standard warranty do not generate revenue. We recognize substantially all non-warranty revenue upon completion of the service because that is the point in time when we satisfy our performance obligation.
As part of our ongoing service business, we satisfy our service obligations under preventative maintenance contracts and extended warranties. Up-front fees received for extended warranties or maintenance plans are deferred and recorded in customer deposits and other on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Revenue under these arrangements is recognized ratably over the underlying terms, as we do not have historical information that would allow us to project the estimated service usage pattern at this time. 
We expense the incremental costs of obtaining contracts when the amortization period of the costs is less than one year. These costs are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Our remaining performance obligations primarily relate to customer purchase orders for products we have not yet shipped. We expect to fulfill the majority of these performance obligations within one year.
Research and Development Expenses
Costs incurred to advance, test, or otherwise modify our technology or develop new technologies are considered research and development costs and are expensed when incurred. These costs are primarily comprised of costs associated with the operation of our laboratories and research facilities, including internal labor, materials, and overhead.
Stock-Based Compensation
Accounting for stock-based compensation requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair value at the grant date. 
We estimate the fair value of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) on the grant date. For RSUs that contain a time-based and/or performance-based vesting condition, we estimate fair value using the closing share price on the grant date. 
We record stock-based compensation expense for awards with time-based vesting conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards with a performance-based vesting condition, we record stock-based compensation expense (based on our assessment of the probability of meeting the performance conditions) over the estimated period to achieve the performance conditions. If the awards are forfeited, we reverse the stock-based compensation expense.
58

Table of Contents
ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (continued)
Certain RSUs vest based on a market condition. Our stock-based compensation expense is based on an estimate of the fair value and probability of achievement for each tranche of these awards using a Monte Carlo simulation. For these RSUs, we recognize stock-based compensation expense over each tranche’s estimated achievement period even if some or all of the shares never vest.
For all stock awards, we estimate forfeitures at the grant date and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates. 
Income Taxes
We follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences. A deferred tax asset or liability is computed for both the expected future impact of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carryforwards. Tax rate changes are reflected in the period such changes are enacted.
We assess the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. Our assessment includes several factors, including historical results and taxable income projections for each jurisdiction. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent on the generation of taxable income in appropriate jurisdictions during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in determining the amount of the valuation allowance. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, we determine if we will more likely than not realize the benefits of these deductible differences.
Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining, if based on the technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolutions of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, and new audit activity.
Under U.S. GAAP, an accounting policy election can be made to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”) in future years, or to provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year that the tax is incurred as a period expense only. We have elected to account for GILTI in the year that the tax is incurred.
Commitments and Contingencies
We are involved in disputes and legal actions arising in the normal course of our business. While we currently believe that the amount of any ultimate loss would not be material to our financial position, the outcome of these actions is inherently difficult to predict. In the event of an adverse outcome, the ultimate loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or reported results of operations. An unfavorable decision in intellectual property litigation also could require material changes in production processes and products or result in our inability to ship products or components found to have violated third party intellectual property rights. We accrue loss contingencies in connection with our commitments and contingencies, including litigation, when it is probable that a loss has occurred, and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. We are not currently a party to any legal action that we believe would reasonably have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

New Accounting Standards
From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standards setting bodies issue new accounting pronouncements. Updates to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) are communicated through issuance of an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”). Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued guidance, whether adopted or to be adopted in the future, will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
New Accounting Standards Adopted
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07 “Segment Reporting (Topic 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” The amendments in ASU 2023-07 expand disclosure requirements. In addition, the ASU enhances interim disclosures, clarifies circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, and provides new disclosures requirements for entities with a single reportable segment. We adopted this guidance on December 31, 2024, and it was not material to our consolidated financial statements.
New Accounting Standards

Issued But Not Yet Adopted 
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09 “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” ASU 2023-09 requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional disclosure on income taxes paid. This guidance will be effective for us on January 1, 2025 for annual disclosures. We do not expect the above guidance to materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2024, the SEC issued climate-related disclosure rules. These rules do not change accounting treatment, but they significantly expand the climate-related information companies are required to disclose. Several petitions were filed challenging these climate-related disclosure rules and, in April 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed the rules, pending completion of judicial review. Disclosure requirements, absent the results of pending legal challenges, may begin phasing in with our annual reporting for the year ending December 31, 2025. We do not expect the above disclosure requirement to materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We are evaluating the disclosure requirements and changes to our business processes, systems, and controls to support the additional disclosures. 
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 final standard on Income Statement: Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires disaggregated disclosure of income statement expenses for public business entities. The ASU does not change the expense captions an entity presents on the face of the income statement; rather, it requires disaggregation of certain expense captions into specified categories in disclosures within the footnotes to the financial statements. This guidance will be effective for us on January 1, 2027. We do not expect the above guidance to materially impact our consolidated financial statements.

Of the $

 million and $
100.5
 million net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, $
121.4
 million and $
107.9
 million, respectively, were included as a net non-current deferred tax asset within other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. $
0.6
 million and $
7.4
 million, respectively, were included as a net non-current deferred tax liability within other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
During the fourth quarter of 2024, we completed the transfer of certain intellectual property between certain of our legal entities in connection with simplifying our corporate legal entity structure. The tax impact of the transfer resulted in the recognition of deferred tax assets totaling approximately $
23.0
 million with a corresponding decrease to tax expense. 
As of December 31, 2024, we have recorded a total valuation allowance on $
2.9
 million of our U.S. domestic deferred tax assets, largely attributable to state carryforward attributes that are expected to expire before sufficient income can be realized in those jurisdictions. The remaining valuation allowance on deferred tax assets approximates $
39.4
 million and is associated primarily with operations in Hong Kong, Germany, China, and Switzerland. As of December 31, 2024, there is not sufficient positive evidence to conclude that such deferred tax assets, presently reduced by a valuation allowance, will more likely than not be recognized. The December 31, 2024 valuation allowance balance reflects an increase of $
4.4
 million during the year.
As of December 31, 2024, we had U.S., foreign and state tax loss carryforwards of $
31.3
 million, $
277.7
 million, and $
107.2
 million, respectively. Additionally, we had $
1.6
 million and $
30.5
 million of capital loss and interest expense limitation carryforwards, respectively. Finally, we had U.S. and state tax credit carryforwards of $
0.1
 million and $
2.3
 million, respectively. The U.S. and state net operating losses, tax credits, and interest expense limitation are

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (continued)
subject to various utilization limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable state laws. These Section 382 limited attributes have various expiration periods through 2036 or, in the case of the interest expense limitation amount, no expiration period. Much of the foreign loss carryforwards, and $
9.7
 million of the federal net operating loss carry forwards, have no expiration period.
We operate under a tax holiday in Singapore, China, and Malaysia. These tax holidays are in effect through June 30, 2027, December 31, 2025, and January 31, 2025, respectively. The tax holidays are conditional upon our meeting certain employment and investment thresholds. The expected benefit of these tax holidays may be limited by the impact of Pillar II global minimum tax or other actions taken by these countries. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the impact of the tax holidays decreased foreign taxes by $
12.4
 million, $
14.3
 million, and $
19.4
 million, respectively, and the benefit on earnings per diluted share was $
0.33
, $
0.38
, and $
0.52
, respectively.
As of December 31, 2024, we have undistributed earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries of approximately $
36.3
 million that we have indefinitely invested, and on which we have not recognized deferred taxes. Estimating the amount of potential tax is not practicable because of the complexity and variety of assumptions necessary to compute the tax.
We account for uncertain tax positions by applying a minimum recognition threshold to tax positions before recognizing these positions in the consolidated financial statements. The following table provides a reconciliation of our total gross unrecognized tax benefits, which we include within other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets:

The unrecognized tax benefits of $
5.7
 million, if recognized, will impact our effective tax rate. In accordance with our accounting policy, we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. We had $
0.8
 million and $
0.7
 million of accrued interest and penalties on December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to federal, state, or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2020.
​
As of January 1, 2024, the Pillar II minimum global effective tax rate of 15% enacted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) was effectuated. More than 140 countries agreed to enact the Pillar II global minimum tax. However, the timing of the implementation for each country varies. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we included an estimate of global minimum tax liability as a result of those countries where we conduct business that have adopted Pillar II. As countries continue to make revisions to their legislation and release additional guidance with respect to the global minimum tax, we continue to determine any potential impact in the countries in which we operate. The impact of these changes may have a material impact on our cash tax expense and tax rate.

We compute basic earnings per share of common stock (“Basic EPS”) by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. 
See 
Note 18. Long-Term Debt 
for information regarding our Convertible Notes, Note Hedges, and Warrants. For diluted earnings per share of common stock (“Diluted EPS”), we increase the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, as needed, to include the following:
●
Additional common shares that would have been outstanding if our outstanding stock awards had been converted to common shares using the treasury stock method. We exclude any stock awards that have an anti-dilutive effect;
●
Dilutive impact associated with the Convertible Notes using the if-converted method. The Convertible Notes are repayable in cash up to par value and in cash or shares of common stock for the excess over par value. When the stock price is lower than the strike price, there is no dilutive or anti-dilutive impact. Prior to conversion, we do not consider the Note Hedges for purposes of Diluted EPS as their effect would be anti-dilutive. Upon conversion, we expect the Note Hedges to offset the dilutive effect of the Convertible Notes when the stock price is above 
$
137.46
 but below 
$
179.76
; and
●
Dilutive effect of the Warrants issued concurrently with the Convertible Notes using the treasury stock method. For all periods presented, the Warrants did not increase the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding because the 
$
179.76
 exercise price of the Warrants exceeded the average market price of our common stock.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (continued)
NOTE 7.           DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our results of operations and cash flows. We may manage these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily forward contracts with banks. These forward contracts manage the exchange rate risk associated with assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies. Typically, we execute these derivative instruments for one-month periods and do not designate them as hedges for accounting purposes; however, they do partially offset the economic fluctuations of certain of our assets and liabilities due to foreign exchange rate changes. The gains and losses related to these foreign currency exchange contracts are intended to offset the corresponding gains and losses on the revaluation of the underlying assets and liabilities. Both are included as a component of other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
At December 31, 2024 we have $
70.6
 million foreign currency forward contracts outstanding. There were 
no
 foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at December 31, 2023.
We had interest rate swap contracts that fixed a portion of the interest payments on our Term Loan Facility. The interest rate swap contracts expired on September 10, 2024. In connection with the expiration, there are no longer any related balances for these contracts within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024. See 
Note 18. Long-Term Debt
 in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
See 
Note 6. Fair Value Measurements
 for information regarding the fair value of derivative instruments.
As a result of using derivative financial instruments, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to contracts could fail to meet their contractual obligations. We manage this credit risk by reviewing counterparty creditworthiness on a regular basis and limiting exposure to any single counterparty.
​
NOTE 8.           ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET
We record accounts receivable at net realizable value. Our accounts receivable, net balance on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $
265.3
 million at December 31, 2024. The following table summarizes the changes in expected credit losses related to receivables:

Restructuring
We have several restructuring plans in process:
2024 Plan
On July 29, 2024, we approved actions in furtherance of our manufacturing consolidation initiatives intended to optimize our manufacturing footprint and cost structure, including the closure of our Zhongshan, China manufacturing facility (the “2024 Plan”). In connection with the 2024 Plan, we recorded a $
29.6
 million charge primarily associated with expected employment-related charges for, among other things, one-time cash payments for severance, benefits expenses, payroll taxes, and other ancillary costs. The charge includes estimated liabilities for lease termination and facility exit costs, which could be subject to further adjustments. The remaining contractual rental obligations under the lease agreements are recorded in current portion of operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
​
The amounts incurred as a result of the approved actions are estimates and actual results may differ, which could result in incremental restructuring charges in future periods. We anticipate the 2024 Plan will be substantially completed by the end of second quarter of 2025, with final activities expected to conclude in 2026.
​
2023 Plan
In 2023, we approved a plan intended to optimize and further consolidate our manufacturing operations and functional support groups as well as a general reduction-in-force to align our expenses to revenue levels (the “2023 Plan”). We expect to incur approximately $
1.0
 million in additional charges through the second quarter of 2025. The 2023 Plan is substantially complete, with the final activities expected to conclude in 2026. 
​
2022 Plan
This plan was approved to improve our operating efficiencies and drive the realization of synergies from our business combinations by consolidating our operations, optimizing our factory footprint, including moving certain production into our higher volume factories, reducing redundancies, and lowering our cost structure. The 2022 Plan is now complete.

NOTE 15.           EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
Defined Contribution Plans
We have a 401(k) profit-sharing and retirement savings plan covering substantially all full-time U.S. employees. Participants may defer up to the maximum amount permitted by law. Participants are immediately vested in both their own contributions and profit-sharing contributions. Profit-sharing contributions, which are discretionary, are approved by the Board. For all periods presented, we based our profit-sharing contribution on matching 
100
% of employee contributions up to 
3
% of compensation plus an additional match of 
50
% on the next 
2
% of compensation.
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 we recognized total defined contribution plan costs of $
5.0
 million, $
5.1
 million, and $
4.5
 million, respectively.
Defined Benefit Plans
We maintain defined benefit pension plans for certain of our non-U.S. employees in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Philippines. Each plan is managed locally and in accordance with respective local laws and regulations. 
To measure the expense and related benefit obligation, we make various assumptions, including discount rates used to value the obligation, expected return on plan assets used to fund these expenses, and estimated future inflation rates. We base these assumptions on historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. We use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability associated with pension benefits.
The information provided below includes one pension plan which is part of discontinued operations. As such, for all periods presented, all related expenses are reported in discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

NOTE 16.           
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors administers our stock plans. As of December 31, 2024, we have 
two
 active stock-based incentive compensation plans: the Amended and Restated 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “2023 Incentive Plan”) and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). We issue all new equity compensation grants under the 2023 Incentive Plan. Outstanding awards previously issued under inactive plans will continue to vest and remain exercisable in accordance with the terms of the respective plans.
The 2023 Incentive Plan provides for the grant of awards including stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance stock units, performance units, stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and cash incentive awards. 
The following table summarizes information related to our stock-based incentive compensation plans:

Stock-based Compensation Expense
We recognize stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of the awards issued and the functional area of the employee receiving the award. For the year ended December 31, 2024, stock-based compensation expense includes $
1.8
 million related to a modification for accounting purposes of prior awards and $
1.9
 million related to the Airity acquisition (see 
Note 2. Acquisition

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The ESPP is a stockholder-approved plan that allows eligible employees to purchase our common stock at a discount. Employees who meet the eligibility criteria may contribute up to the lesser of 
15
% of their eligible earnings or $
5,000
 during each plan period. Currently, the plan period is six months. The purchase price of common stock purchased under the ESPP is currently equal to the lower of 1) 
85
% of the fair market value of our common stock on the commencement date of each plan period or 2) 
85
% of the fair market value of our common shares on each plan period purchase date. 
As of December 31, 2024, there was $
0.5
 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the ESPP that we expect to recognize over a remaining period of 
five months
.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (continued)
Deferred Compensation Plan 
We offer certain employees the opportunity to elect to defer compensation for salary, bonus, commission, and stock awards. The Company maintains a rabbi trust in connection with the deferred compensation plan. Assets of the rabbi trust not held in Company shares are presented in other assets, and the fair value of the Company shares held in the rabbi trust is classified in stockholders’ equity. After a holding period, employees have the option to diversify the Company shares into other funds. Stock awards that have been elected for deferral but have not yet vested and are probable of vesting are reported as deferred compensation in the temporary equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The stock awards recorded in temporary equity are recognized at fair value, with any difference from stock-based compensation recorded in retained earnings. 
​
​
NOTE 17.           COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
We are involved in disputes and legal actions arising in the normal course of our business. While we currently believe that the amount of any ultimate loss would not be material to our financial position, the outcome of these actions is inherently difficult to predict. In the event of an adverse outcome, the ultimate loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or reported results of operations. An unfavorable decision in intellectual property litigation also could require material changes in production processes and products or result in our inability to ship products or components found to have violated third party intellectual property rights. We accrue loss contingencies in connection with our commitments and contingencies, including litigation, when it is probable that a loss has occurred, and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. We are not currently a party to any legal action that we believe would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
We maintain defined benefit pension plans for certain of our non-U.S. employees, including those in the United Kingdom. In light of the United Kingdom’s High Court ruling in the case of Virgin Media Ltd v. NTL Pension Trustees II Ltd & Ors, we reviewed past amendments made to our United Kingdom pension plans. While unlikely, should there be a challenge to any previous amendments, we could face potential litigation and compliance risks. We continue to account for our United Kingdom pension plans in accordance with the plan agreements and amendments, as we believe they represent a mutual understanding and agreement among all parties.

Credit Agreement
Our credit agreement dated as of September 10, 2019, as amended (the “Credit Agreement”) consists of a senior unsecured term loan facility (“Term Loan Facility”) and a senior unsecured revolving facility (“Revolving Facility”), both maturing on September 9, 2026. 
On September 9, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement to increase the capacity on the Revolving Facility from $
200.0
 million to $
600.0
 million. This amendment was in connection with the concurrent prepayment, using existing cash on hand, of the full $
345.0
 million outstanding principal balance under our Term Loan Facility.
For all periods presented, 
no
 amounts were outstanding on the Revolving Facility. The following table summarizes our availability to withdraw on the Revolving Facility:

In addition to our available capacity on the Revolving Facility, prior to the maturity date of the Credit Agreement, we may request an increase to the financing commitments in either the Term Loan Facility or Revolving Facility by an aggregate amount not to exceed $
250.0
 million. Any requested increase is subject to lender approval.
The interest rate swap contracts previously entered into relative to the Term Loan Facility expired on September 10, 2024. Should we have future borrowings under the Term Loan Facility or Revolving Facility, they will bear interest, at our option, at a rate based on the Base Rate or SOFR, as defined in the Credit Agreement, plus an applicable margin.
​
Convertible Senior Notes due 2028
On September 12, 2023, we completed a private, unregistered offering of $
575.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
2.50
% convertible senior notes due 2028 (“Convertible Notes”). The $
564.7
 million remaining outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Notes, net of unamortized issuance costs, continues to be classified as long-term debt as none of the conversion triggers occurred as of December 31, 2024. 
The Convertible Notes mature on September 15, 2028, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears in March and September. We do not maintain a sinking fund. 
82

Table of Contents
ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (continued)
We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Convertible Notes, at our option, on or after September 20, 2026 if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 
130
% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 
30
 consecutive trading-day period (including the last trading day of such period). The redemption price is 
100
% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.
Prior to May 15, 2028, holders have the option to convert all or a portion of their Convertible Notes under the following circumstances:
●
during any calendar quarter if the last reported sale price of our common stock, for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days is greater than or equal to 
130
%
 of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; 
●
during the 
five
 business day period immediately after any 
five
 consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per 
$
1,000
 principal amount of the Convertible Notes for each trading day was less than 
98
%
 of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock on each such trading day and the conversion rate on each such trading day; 
●
if Advanced Energy calls any or all of the Convertible Notes for redemption; or 
●
upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions or events described in the indenture.
From May 15, 2028 through the maturity date, holders have the option to convert at any time regardless of circumstances.
The initial conversion rate is 
7.2747
 shares of common stock per $
1,000
 principal amount, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
137.46
 per share of common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events as set forth in the indenture. 
Upon conversion, Advanced Energy will do the following:
●
pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount to be converted; and 
●
pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination (at our election) with respect to the remainder, if any, of the conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount being converted. 
Concurrent with the Convertible Notes issuance, we entered into hedges (“Note Hedges”) with respect to our common stock and sold 
warrants to purchase our common stock (“Warrants”)
. I
n combination, the Note Hedges and Warrants synthetically increase the initial conversion price on the Convertible Notes from $
137.46
 to $
179.76
, reducing the potential dilutive effect.
The
 Warrants provide the counterparties the option to acquire approximately 
4.2
 million aggregate shares of our common stock (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments), which is the same number of shares of our common stock covered by the Note Hedges at a 
$
179.76
 per share initial exercise price, which represents a 
70
%
 premium over the 
$
105.74
 closing price of our common stock on September 7, 2023. The Warrants expire on July 7, 2029. 
If the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the exercise price of the Warrants during the measurement period at the maturity of such Warrants, the Warrants will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share as we will owe the counterparties a number of shares of common stock in an amount based on the excess of such market price per share of the common stock over the Warrants’ exercise price. 
83

Table of Contents
ADVANCED ENERGY INDUSTRIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (continued)
The Note Hedge and Warrants are separate from the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes holders have no rights with respect to the Note Hedges and Warrants. Counterparties in the Note Hedge and Warrants transactions have no rights with respect to the Convertible Notes. 
We use level 2 measurements to estimate the fair value of our debt. As of December 31, 2024, we estimate the fair value of our Convertible Notes to be $
624.6
 million.

We have established disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Principal Executive Officer (Stephen D. Kelley, President and Chief Executive Officer) and Principal Financial Officer (Paul R. Oldham, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
As of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation, with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b). Based upon this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024. The conclusions of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer from this evaluation were communicated to the Audit and Finance Committee. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We intend to continue to review and document our disclosure controls and procedures, including our internal controls over financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
It is management’s responsibility to establish and maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting, which is a process designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and effected by our Board of Directors, management, and other personnel. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance concerning the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, using the criteria described in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based upon this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K, and as part of the audit, has issued an audit report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the current year that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Limitations on Controls and Procedures
Management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of our control system are met. We do not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all misstatements, errors, or fraud, if any. All control systems, no matter how well designed and implemented, have inherent limitations, and therefore no evaluation can provide absolute assurance that every misstatement, error, or instance of fraud, if any, or risk thereof, has been or will be prevented or detected. The occurrence of a misstatement, error, or fraud, if any, would not necessarily require a conclusion that our controls and procedures are not effective.
