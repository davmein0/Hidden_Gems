In addition to the above principal properties, we have several other facilities throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. We consider the properties that we own or lease as adequate to meet our current and future requirements. We regularly assess the size, capability, and location of our global infrastructure and periodically make adjustments based on these assessments.
