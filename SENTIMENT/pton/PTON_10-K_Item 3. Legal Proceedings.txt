Item 3. Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we may be involved in claims and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. The outcome of any such claims or proceedings, regardless of the merits, is inherently uncertain.
For a discussion of legal and other proceedings in which we are involved, see 
Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies

Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Market Information for Common Stock
Our Class A common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "PTON" on September 26, 2019. Prior to that date, there was no public trading market for our Class A common stock.
Our Class B common stock is not listed or traded on any stock exchange.
Holders of Record
As of July 30, 2025, there were 37 registered holders of our Class A common stock and 66 registered holders of our Class B common stock. Because many of our shares of Class A common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders.
Dividend Policy
We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We do not expect to pay dividends on our capital stock for the foreseeable future. Instead, we anticipate that all of our earnings for the foreseeable future will be used for repayment of debt and for the operation and growth of our business. Any future determination to declare cash dividends would be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and would depend upon various factors, including our operating results, financial condition, and capital requirements, restrictions that may be imposed by applicable law, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. In addition, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited by the restrictions under the terms of our credit agreement and security agreement.
Performance Graph
The following performance graph shall not be deemed soliciting material or to be filed with the SEC for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any of our other filings under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act.
The graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our Class A common stock with the cumulative total return on the Russell 2000 Index, Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, and the Nasdaq Computer Index. We have elected to replace the S&P 500 Index with the Russell 2000 Index because we believe the new broad equity market index provides for a better comparison of returns with public companies of similar size and market capitalization. We are also a component of the Russell 2000 Index. For the current year only, comparisons of the Company’s returns to both the S&P 500 Index and the Russell 2000 Index are included in the graph. The graph assumes an initial investment of $100 in our common stock and each index at the market close on the last trading day for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. Data for each index assumes reinvestment of dividends.
The comparisons in the graph below are based upon historical data and are not indicative of, nor intended to forecast, future performance of our common stock.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in the section titled "Special Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements," the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other important factors that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
A discussion of our results of operations for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 compared to the year ended June 30, 2023 is included our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on August 22, 2024 (File No. 001-39058) under the heading “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Overview
Peloton is a leading global fitness and wellness company that empowers its Members to live fit, strong, long, and happy by providing fitness and wellness products and services they can use anytime, anywhere. We have a highly engaged community of approximately 6 million Members as of 
June 30, 2025, across the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Australia, and Austria. As a category innovator at the nexus of fitness and wellness, technology, and media, we deliver experiences through our world-renowned Instructors, premium hardware and innovative software, personalization, and extensive modalities and content formats. Founded in 2012 and headquartered in New York City, Peloton aims to scale across the markets in which it operates.
We define a “Member” as any individual who has a Peloton account through a paid Connected Fitness Subscription or a paid App Subscription, inclusive of the Peloton App+, App One and Strength+ Memberships (our “Peloton Apps”), and engages in one or more workouts in the trailing 12-month period. We define workout engagement as either (i) completing the lesser of 50% or 10 minutes of Instructor-led classes, Scenic, and Lanebreak workouts; (ii) at least 10 minutes of any activity tracking workout (such as “Just Ride,” “Just Run,” or “Just Row”) or Entertainment workout; or (iii) at least 5 minutes of any Strength+ workout with 80% of sets marked complete.
Our Connected Fitness Products portfolio includes the Peloton Bike, Bike+, Tread, Tread+, Guide, Row and various Precor products. Access to the Peloton Apps is available with an All-Access or Guide Membership for Members who have Connected Fitness Products or through a standalone App Membership (App+, App One, or Strength+). Access to the Strength+ App is available with an All-Access, Guide, or App+ Membership or through a standalone Strength+ subscription. Our revenue is generated primarily from recurring Subscription revenue and the sale of our Connected Fitness Products. We define a “Paid Connected Fitness Subscription” as a person, household, or commercial property, such as a hotel or residential building, that has paid for a subscription to a Connected Fitness Product (a Connected Fitness Subscription with a successful credit card billing or with prepaid subscription credits or waivers). “Paid App Subscriptions” include all subscriptions to our Peloton Apps for which we currently receive payment.
Our financial profile has been characterized by strong retention, recurring revenue, and efficient customer acquisition. We believe that o
ur low Average Net Monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription Churn, together with our high Subscription Gross Profit and Subscription Contribution Margin, yields an attractive lifetime value (“LTV”) for our Connected Fitness Subscriptions well in excess of our customer acquisition costs (“CAC”). Maintaining 
an attractive LTV/CAC ratio is a primary goal of our customer acquisition strategy.
Restructuring
In August 2025, the Company announced a new restructuring plan (the “2025 Restructuring Plan”), which includes a reduction in global headcount and is intended to improve the Company’s cost structure, operating efficiency, and profitability, while providing us the opportunity to return to growth by reinvesting expected savings into our differentiating capabilities. The Company expects the 2025 Restructuring Plan to be substantially implemented by the end of fiscal year 2026, which is subject to change.
As of June 30, 2025, actions pursuant to our 2024 Restructuring Plan, which includes any remaining restructuring activity under the original 2022 Restructuring Plan, have been substantially completed. As such, any remaining charges under these plans are included within the 2025 Restructuring Plan. 
In connection with the 2025 Restructuring Plan, we estimate that we will incur additional cash restructuring charges of approximately $50.0 million, primarily comprised of location strategy costs, lease termination costs, and other exit costs. Additionally, we expect to recognize additional non-cash restructuring charges of approximately $10.0 million, primarily comprised of asset write-downs and write-offs, in connection with the continued exit of the Company’s retail and other leased locations. We expect these charges to be substantially incurred by the end of fiscal year 2026, which is subject to change.
Upon full implementation, we expect the 2025 Restructuring Plan to achieve at least $100 million of run-rate savings by the end of fiscal year 2026. 
We may not be able to realize the cost savings and benefits initially anticipated as a result of the Restructuring Plans, and implementation and transition costs may be greater than expected. See 
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not successfully execute or achieve the expected benefits of our restructuring initiatives and other cost-saving measures we may take in the future, and our efforts may result in further actions and/or additional asset impairment charges and adversely affect our business
” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Global Trade Policies and Tariffs
We continue to closely monitor changes in international trade policies, relations, legislation and regulations, including those related to tariffs, which could adversely impact the global economy and our business, financial condition, and operating results. The impact of any tariffs will depend on various factors, including whether the tariffs are ultimately implemented, the timing of implementation, and the amount, scope and nature of the tariffs. 
Other Developments
We have received a small number of reports that a Bike+ seat post broke during use. We are planning to offer certain Bike+ Members our newest seat post as a replacement for their existing seat post. We do not currently expect that the expenses associated with this plan will be material to our financial position. In the event we incur material expenses or face other challenges relating to the Bike+ seat post, including the implementation of other measures resulting from our engagement with governmental authorities on this matter, our results of operations, financial condition and reputation could be adversely affected.
Key Operational and Business Metrics 
In addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key operational and business metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, develop financial forecasts, and make strategic decisions.

 ______________________________
(1) Beginning January 1, 2025, the Company migrated its subscription data model for reporting Ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions, Average Net Monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription Churn, Ending Paid App Subscriptions, and Average Monthly Paid App Subscription Churn to a new data model that provides greater visibility to changes to a subscription's payment status when they occur. The new model gives the Company more precise and timely data on subscription pause and churn behavior. Prior period information has been revised to conform with current period presentation. The impact of this change in the model on Ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions, Average Net Monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription Churn, Ending Paid App Subscriptions and Average Monthly Paid App Subscription Churn for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023 is immaterial.
(2) New reporting metrics, effective as of the beginning of fiscal year 2024, Ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions replaced Ending Connected Fitness Subscriptions, and Average Net Monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription Churn replaced Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn. See definitions below.
(3) This metric, effective as of the beginning of fiscal year 2024, is reported on a go-forward basis as it includes App One and App+ subscriptions that were not available during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.
(4) Please see the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin” for a reconciliation of Subscription Gross Profit to Subscription Contribution and an explanation of why we consider Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin to be helpful measures for investors.
(5) Please see the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Adjusted EBITDA” for a reconciliation of Net loss to Adjusted EBITDA and an explanation of why we consider Adjusted EBITDA to be a helpful measure for investors.
(6) Please see the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Free Cash Flow” for a reconciliation of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities to Free Cash Flow and an explanation of why we consider Free Cash Flow to be a helpful measure for investors.
Ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions
Ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions includes all Connected Fitness Subscriptions for which we are currently receiving payment (a successful credit card billing or prepaid subscription credit or waiver). Prior to fiscal year 2024, we included a Connected Fitness Subscription that is paused for up to three months as a Connected Fitness Subscription. Because there is no payment on a paused subscription, effective as of the beginning of fiscal year 2024, we do not include paused Connected Fitness Subscriptions in our Ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscription count.
Average Net Monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription Churn
To align with the definition of Ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions above, our quarterly Average Net Monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription Churn is calculated as follows: Paid Connected Fitness Subscriber “churn count” in the quarter, divided by the average number of beginning Paid Connected Fitness Subscribers each month, divided by three months. “Churn count” is defined as quarterly Connected Fitness Subscription churn events minus Connected Fitness Subscription unpause events minus Connected Fitness Subscription reactivations. Our 
44
annual Average Net Monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription Churn for each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023 is calculated in the same manner, divided by twelve months, during each respective fiscal year.
We refer to any cancellation or pausing of a subscription for our All-Access Membership as a churn event. Because we do not receive payment for paused Connected Fitness Subscriptions, a paused Connected Fitness Subscription is now treated as a churn event at the time the pause goes into effect, which is the start of the next billing cycle. An unpause event occurs when a pause period elapses without a cancellation and the Connected Fitness Subscription resumes, and is therefore counted as a reduction in our churn count in that period. Consistent with our previous practice, our churn count is shown net of reactivations and our new quarterly Average Net Monthly Paid Connected Fitness Subscription Churn metric averages the monthly Connected Fitness churn percentage across the three months of the reported quarter.
Prior to fiscal year 2024, we reported Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn, which is defined as Connected Fitness Subscription cancellations, net of reactivations, in the quarter, divided by the average number of beginning Connected Fitness Subscriptions in each month, divided by three months. This metric does not treat a pause of a Connected Fitness Subscription as a churn event. When a Connected Fitness Subscription payment method fails, we communicate with our Members to update their payment method and make multiple attempts over several days to charge the payment method on file and reactivate the subscription. We cancel a Member's Connected Fitness Subscription when it remains unpaid for two days after their billing cycle date.
Furthermore, we have reported our Average Net Monthly Connected Fitness Churn metric net of reactivations. Under this metric, a Connected Fitness Subscriber that cancels their membership (a churn event) and resubscribes in a subsequent period is considered a reactivation and is counted as a reduction in our churn count in the period during which the Subscriber resubscribes. These metrics do not include data related to Subscribers to our Peloton Apps.
Ending Paid App Subscriptions
Ending Paid App Subscriptions include all subscriptions to our Peloton Apps for which we are currently receiving payment.
Average Monthly Paid App Subscription Churn
When a Subscriber to our Peloton Apps cancels their membership (a churn event) and resubscribes in a subsequent period, the resubscription is considered a new subscription (rather than a reactivation that is counted as a reduction in our churn count). Our quarterly Average Paid App Subscription Churn is calculated as follows: Paid App Subscription cancellations in the quarter, divided by the average number of beginning Paid App Subscriptions each month, divided by three months. Our annual Average Monthly Paid App Subscription Churn for each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023 is calculated in the same manner, divided by twelve months, during each respective fiscal year. 
Components of our Results of Operations
Revenue
Connected Fitness Products
Connected Fitness Products Revenue primarily consists of sales of our portfolio of Connected Fitness Products and related accessories, as well as Precor-branded fitness products, delivery and installation services, Peloton Bike portfolio rental products, extended warranty agreements, branded apparel, and commercial service contracts. Connected Fitness Products Revenue is recognized at the time of delivery, except for extended warranty revenue that is recognized over the warranty period and service revenue that is recognized over the term, and is recorded net of sales returns and concessions, discounts and allowances, and third-party financing program fees, when applicable.
Subscription
Subscription Revenue primarily consists of revenue generated from our Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions and Paid Peloton App Subscriptions, inclusive of the Strength+ App, which are offered on a month-to-month or prepaid basis. 
As of 
June 30, 2025, 99% and 82% of 
our Connected Fitness Subscription and Paid App Subscription bases, respectively, were paying month-to-month.
If a Connected Fitness Subscription owns multiple, different Peloton Connected Fitness Products (such as a Peloton Bike and Peloton Tread) in the same household, the price of the Subscription remains $44 monthly. As of June 30, 2025, approximately 12% of our Connected Fitness Subscriptions owned multiple, different Connected Fitness Products.
Cost of revenue
Connected Fitness Products
Connected Fitness Products Cost of revenue primarily consists of our portfolio of Connected Fitness Products, related accessories, Precor-branded fitness products, and branded apparel product costs, including third party manufacturing costs, duties and other applicable importing costs, shipping and handling costs, packaging, warranty replacement and service costs, fulfillment costs, warehousing costs, costs related to our commercial business, depreciation of property and equipment, and certain costs related to management, facilities, and personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, and expense associated with supply chain logistics. Inventory write-downs and related obsolescence reserve expense are also included within Connected Fitness Products Cost of revenue.  
45
Subscription
Subscription Cost of revenue primarily consists of costs associated with content creation and costs to stream content to our Members. These costs consist of both fixed costs, including Instructor, content, and production personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, depreciation of property and equipment, studio rent and occupancy, and other studio overhead, as well as variable costs, including music royalty fees, third-party platform streaming costs, and payment processing fees for our monthly subscription billings.
Operating expenses
Sales and marketing
Sales and marketing expense primarily consists of performance marketing media spend, asset creation, and other brand creative, sales and marketing personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, costs to operate our retail showrooms including rent and occupancy charges, payment processing fees incurred in connection with the sale of our Connected Fitness Products, expenses related to the Peloton Apps, and depreciation of property and equipment.
General and administrative
General and administrative expense primarily consists of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, and facilities-related costs, primarily for our executive, finance, accounting, legal, human resources, IT functions and Member support team. General and administrative expense also includes software and IT costs, fees for professional services principally comprising legal, audit, tax and accounting services, depreciation of property and equipment, insurance, and litigation settlement costs.
Research and development
Research and development expense primarily consists of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, and facilities-related expenses, consulting and contractor expenses, tooling and prototype materials, software platform expenses, and depreciation of property and equipment. We capitalize certain qualified costs incurred in connection with the development of internal-use software that may also cause research and development expenses to vary from period to period.
Impairment expense 
Impairment expense primarily consists of non-cash impairment charges relating to long-lived assets. Impairments are determined using management’s judgment about our anticipated ability to continue to use fixed assets in-service and under development, current economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these consolidated financial statements. Additionally, long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Management disposes of fixed assets during the regular course of business due to damage, obsolescence, strategic shifts, and loss.
Restructuring expense
Restructuring expense consists of severance and other personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, professional services, facility closures and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities.
Supplier settlements
Supplier settlements are payments made to third-party suppliers to terminate certain future inventory purchase commitments or settle disputes with suppliers about and to terminate certain alleged past and future commitments.
Non-operating income and expenses
Total other expense, net
Total other expense, net primarily consists of interest (expense) income, unrealized and realized (losses) gains on investments, net gains relating to our refinancing activities, and foreign exchange gains (losses).
Income tax expense (benefit)
The provision for income taxes primarily consists of income taxes related to state and international taxes for jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a valuation allowance on the majority of our deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred assets will not be utilized.

Connected Fitness Products Revenue decreased $174.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily attributable to fewer Connected Fitness product deliveries driven by lower demand during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, partially offset by improvements in Precor revenue and more Tread+ deliveries during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.

Subscription Revenue decreased $35.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in Paid Connected Fitness and App Subscriptions, partially offset by an increase in content licensing revenue and incremental Used Equipment Activation Fee revenue, which was introduced during the first quarter of fiscal 2025.

Fiscal Years Ended June 30, 2025 and 2024
Connected Fitness Products Cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 decreased $237.1 million, or 25.1%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily driven by fewer Connected Fitness product deliveries, resulting from lower demand during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, as well as lower freight and warehousing costs. This decrease was partially offset by higher Precor sales and more Tread+ deliveries during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.
Our Connected Fitness Products Gross Margin increased to 13.6% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 compared to 4.9% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, primarily driven a mix shift towards higher margin products, as well as lower inventory write-downs and lower warehousing and transportation costs during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 when compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. These improvements were partially offset by changes in our warranty reserves.
Subscription Cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 decreased $34.4 million, or 6.2%, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower costs associated with content production and music royalties, lower personnel-related expenses, inclusive of stock-based compensation expense, due to decreased average headcount, and a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense.
Subscription Gross Margin increased modestly for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to our results determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, we believe the following non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance.
Adjusted EBITDA
We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net (loss) income adjusted to exclude: other expense (income), net; net (gains) losses on debt refinancing; income tax expense (benefit); depreciation and amortization expense; stock-based compensation expense; impairment expense; restructuring expense; product recall related matters; certain litigation and settlement expenses; supplier settlements; and other adjustment items that arise outside the ordinary course of our business.
51
We use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons:
•
Adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense, other expense (income), net, and provision for income taxes that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures, and the method by which assets were acquired;
•
Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our core operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial performance; and
•
Adjusted EBITDA provides consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our core operating results, and may also facilitate comparisons with other peer companies, many of which use a similar non-GAAP financial measure to supplement their GAAP results.
Our use of Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are, or may in the future be, as follows:
•
Although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;
•
Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: (1) changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (2) interest and other income (expense), or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt, which reduces cash available to us; or (3) income taxes, which may represent a reduction in cash available to us;
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect gains (losses) associated with refinancing efforts that we have determined are outside of the ordinary course of business and are nonrecurring, infrequent or unusual based on factors such as the nature and strategy of the refinancing, as well as our frequency and past practice of performing refinancing activities; 
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect certain litigation expenses, consisting of legal settlements and related fees for specific proceedings that we have determined arise outside of the ordinary course of business and are nonrecurring, infrequent or unusual based on the following considerations which we assess regularly: (1) the frequency of similar cases that have been brought to date, or are expected to be brought within two years; (2) the complexity of the case; (3) the nature of the remedy(ies) sought, including the size of any monetary damages sought; (4) offensive versus defensive posture of us; (5) the counterparty involved; and (6) our overall litigation strategy. Following a change in practice beginning during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, we no longer adjust Adjusted EBITDA for costs from new patent litigation or consumer arbitration claims, unless we consider the matter to be nonrecurring, infrequent or unusual. We continue to adjust Adjusted EBITDA for historical patent infringement and consumer arbitration claims that were determined, prior to our change in practice, to be nonrecurring, infrequent, or unusual;
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect acquisition-related costs, including transaction and integration costs;
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect impairment charges and gains (losses) on disposals of fixed assets;
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect costs associated with certain product recall related matters including adjustments to the return reserves, inventory write-downs, logistics costs associated with Member requests, the cost to move the recalled product for those that elect the option, subscription waiver costs of service, and recall-related hardware development and repair costs. We make adjustments for product recall related matters that we have determined arise outside of the ordinary course of business and are nonrecurring, infrequent or unusual based on factors including the nature of the product recall, our experience with similar product recalls at the time of such assessment, the impacts on us of the recall remedy and associated logistics, supply chain, and other externalities, as well as the expected consumer demand for such a remedy, and operational complexities in the design, regulatory approval and deployment of a remedy;
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect
 costs associated with restructuring plans;
•
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect supplier settlements that are
 outside of the ordinary course of business and are nonrecurring, infrequent or unusual based on factors such as the nature of the settlements, as well as our frequency and past practice of performing refinancing activities
; and
•
The expenses and other items that we exclude in our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA when they report their operating results and we may, in the future, exclude other significant, unusual expenses or other items from this financial measure. Because companies in our industry may calculate this measure differently than we do, its usefulness as a comparative measure can be limited.
Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered along with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP.

(2) Represents the net charge resulting from our May 2024 refinancing efforts. The Company has not demonstrated a past practice of refinancing its previously issued and secured debt obligations, and considers these charges incurred in order to perform this refinancing to be nonrecurring, infrequent, unusual, and outside the ordinary of business.
(3) Represents charges incurred in connection with the Restructuring Plans, refer to 
Note 4, Restructuring
 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(4) 
Represents accruals

related to settlement of disputes with various third-party suppliers about certain alleged past and future commitments, which occurred due to part of an unusual, one-time effort to adjust the Company’s forecasted inventory during its fiscal years 2022 and 2023. With this settlement during the 
fiscal year ended June 30, 2025
, we have substantially settled our purchase commitments related disputes with our suppliers that were linked to our one-time effort to evaluate and adjust the Company’s forecasted inventory needs with its suppliers during fiscal years 2022 and 2023. As such, we currently do not expect to add-back in the future any additional supplier settlements related to that effort.
(5) Represents adjustments and charges primarily associated with our Tread+ and Bike Seat Post product recall related matters, as well as accrual adjustments. These include recorded (benefits) costs in Connected Fitness Products Cost of revenue associated with recall related matters of $(9.5) million and $64.1 million, adjustments to Connected Fitness Products Revenue for actual and estimated future returns of $(4.5) million and $14.6 million, and operating expenses of zero and $2.3 million associated with recall-related hardware development costs, in each case for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
(6) Includes litigation-related expenses for certain patent infringement litigation, consumer arbitration, and product recalls for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, that arise outside of the ordinary course of business and are nonrecurring, infrequent, or unusual. Includes Dish settlement accrual of $75.0 million, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, which was considered significantly more complex than routine intellectual property claims and, in addition to seeking monetary damages or other more typical remedies from a district court, also sought an order from the International Trade Commission to broadly prohibit the Company from the sale, distribution, marketing, transferring, or advertising in the United States of products that had the infringing functionality installed on them, and the importation of products unless they were deemed non-infringing by the International Trade Commission and/or U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Also includes other litigation-related expenses and settlements for certain patent infringement litigation, securities litigation, and consumer arbitration for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, that arose outside of the ordinary course of business and were nonrecurring, infrequent, or unusual.
Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin
We define “Subscription Contribution” as Subscription Revenue less Subscription Cost of revenue, adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expenses included within Subscription Cost of revenue. Subscription Contribution Margin is calculated by dividing Subscription Contribution by Subscription Revenue.
We use Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin to measure our ability to scale and leverage the costs of our Connected Fitness Subscriptions. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our business and in understanding and evaluating our operating results because our management uses Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin in conjunction with financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our core operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial performance.
The use of Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin as analytical tools has limitations, and you should not consider these in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our financial results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows:
•
Although depreciation and amortization expense are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; and
53
•
Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin exclude stock-based compensation expense, which has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy.
Because of these limitations, Subscription Contribution and Subscription Contribution Margin should be considered along with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP.

Free Cash Flow
We define Free Cash Flow as Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less Capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides management, investors, and other users of our financial information with a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows.
The use of Free Cash Flow as an analytical tool has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, Free Cash Flow does not incorporate payments made for purchases of marketable securities or principal repayments on our debt, which reduces cash available to us. Because of these limitations, Free Cash Flow should be considered along with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP.
The following table presents a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP, for each of the periods indicated:

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our operations have been funded primarily through net proceeds from the sales of our equity and convertible debt securities, and our Term Loan (as defined below), as well as cash flows from operating activities. As of June 30, 2025, we had Cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1,039.5 million. 
We anticipate capital expenditures over the next 12 months to include investments in product development, content and our studios, systems implementation, and IT infrastructure. 
54
We believe our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the next 12 months and beyond. Our future capital requirements may vary materially from those currently planned and will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, timing to adjust our supply chain and cost structures in response to material fluctuations in product demand, timing and amount of spending related to acquisitions, the timing and amount of spending on research and development and manufacturing initiatives, the timing and financial impact of product recalls, sales and marketing activities, the timing of new product introductions, market acceptance of our Connected Fitness Products, timing and investments needed for international expansion, and overall economic conditions. To the extent that current and anticipated future sources of liquidity are insufficient to fund our future business activities and requirements, we may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in further dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of debt financing would result in increased debt service obligations and the instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations. There can be no assurances that we will be able to raise additional capital. The inability to raise capital would adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives.
Restructuring
In February 2022, we announced and began implementing the 2022 Restructuring Plan and in April 2024, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan to expand upon the 2022 Restructuring Plan (as expanded and collectively with the 2022 Restructuring Plan, the “2024 Restructuring Plan”). As of June 30, 2025, the actions pursuant to these plans have been substantially completed. In August 2025, the Company announced a new restructuring plan (the “2025 Restructuring Plan”), which includes a reduction in global headcount and is intended to improve the Company’s cost structure, operating efficiency, and profitability, while providing us the opportunity to return to growth by reinvesting expected savings into our differentiating capabilities.
We’ve made progress in implementing these restructuring plans and achieving the goals outlined in 
Note 4, Restructuring
 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In fiscal year 2024, we completed the sale of the Peloton Output Park building and a portion of the corresponding land and received net proceeds of approximately $31.9 million, successfully exited our owned-manufacturing operations, and reduced our global retail showroom footprint. In September 2024, we completed the sale of the remaining Peloton Output Park land parcel and received net proceeds of $4.2 million. We expect substantial further improvements in the goals outlined in 
Note 4, Restructuring
 as well as a number of other measures by which we measure the success of our restructuring initiatives and expect to continue optimizing our retail footprint over fiscal year 2026.
Refer to 
Note 4, Restructuring
 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion around charges incurred to date and future expected charges under the Restructuring Plans. The 2022 and 2024 Restructuring Plans resulted in reduced annual run-rate expenses of more than $200 million as of the end of fiscal year 2025. Upon full implementation, we expect the 2025 Restructuring Plan to achieve at least $100 million of run-rate savings by the end of fiscal year 2026.
We may not be able to realize the cost savings and benefits initially anticipated as a result of the Restructuring Plans, and implementation and transition costs may be greater than expected. See 
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not successfully execute or achieve the expected benefits of our restructuring initiatives and other cost-saving measures we may take in the future, and our efforts may result in further actions and/or additional asset impairment charges and adversely affect our business
.”
2029 and 2026 Convertible Notes
In May 2024, we issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”) in a private offering, including the exercise in full of the option granted to the initial purchasers to purchase $50.0 million of the 2029 Notes. The 2029 Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture (the “2029 Notes Indenture”) between us and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. The 2029 Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.50% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2024. The net proceeds from this offering of 2029 Notes were approximately $342.3 million, after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions. The net proceeds of the offering were used, together with proceeds from the Term Loan (as defined below) and cash on hand, to repurchase approximately $801.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) described below.
The effective interest rate upon issuance of the 2029 Notes was 5.97%, which is the effective interest rate as of June 30, 2025.
The 2029 Notes will mature on December 1, 2029, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. The 2029 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at certain times and upon the occurrence of certain events. A holder may convert its 2029 Notes during any calendar quarter if the last reported sale price per share of the Class A common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for each of at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. The last reported sale price of the Class A common stock exceeded 130% of the conversion price of the 2029 Notes for more than 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days, including the last trading day, ended June 30, 2025. Accordingly, as of July 1, 2025, the 2029 Notes may be converted at the option of the applicable holder through September 30, 2025.
On or after September 1, 2029, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their 2029 Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the applicable holder.
The Company may satisfy any conversion obligation under the 2029 Notes by paying and/or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Class A common stock, at the Company’s election, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the 2029 Notes Indenture. If all of the 2029 Notes were to be converted prior to September 30, 2025, the Company’s current intention would be to settle such conversion in shares of the Class A common stock.

In February 2021, we issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes in a private offering, including the exercise in full of the option granted to the initial purchasers to purchase $125.0 million of the 2026 Notes. The 2026 Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture (the “2026 Notes Indenture”) between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $977.2 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and our offering expenses. 
The effective interest rate upon issuance of the 2026 Notes was 0.45%, which is the effective interest rate as of June 30, 2025.
Repurchase of a Portion of the 2026 Convertible Notes
In May 2024, we entered into separate, privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of the 2026 Notes to repurchase $801.0 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes for an aggregate of $724.9 million of cash. We accounted for this repurchase of the 2026 Notes as a debt extinguishment under ASC 470-50, 
Debt – Modifications and Extinguishments
 (“ASC 470-50”). We recorded a $69.8 million gain on early extinguishment of debt during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, which included the write-off of previously deferred debt issuance costs of $6.3 million, which was included within Net gain on debt refinancing on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.
Termination of Capped Call Transactions
In connection with the offering of the 2026 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain counterparties (the “Capped Call Transactions”). In the last quarter of fiscal year 2024, we terminated the Capped Call Transactions in their entirety pursuant to negotiated termination agreements with each such counterparty.
Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
On May 30, 2024, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain banks and financial institutions party thereto as lenders and issuing banks.
The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for a $1.0 billion term loan facility (the “Term Loan”), which will be due and payable on May 30, 2029. The Term Loan amortizes in quarterly installments of 0.25%, payable at the end of each fiscal quarter and on the maturity date.
The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also provides for a $100.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”), which will mature on May 30, 2029. We are only required to meet the total liquidity covenant, set at $250.0 million for the last business day of any week, and the subscription revenues covenant, set at $1.2 billion for the four-quarter trailing period, to the extent any revolving loans are borrowed and outstanding.
The Revolving Facility, when drawn, bears interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus 4.00% per annum or the Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus 5.00% per annum. We are required to pay an annual commitment fee of 0.500% or 0.375% per annum, depending on whether the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) is greater or less than 5.00 to 1.00, on a quarterly basis based on the unused portion of the Revolving Facility. 
The Term Loan initially bears interest at a rate equal to, at our option, either the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus 5.00% per annum or the Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus 6.00% per annum. The applicable rate for Alternate Base Rate loans or Term SOFR Rate loans is subject to a 0.50% step down, depending on whether the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio is less than 5.00 to 1.00 as measured on a quarterly basis. Any borrowing at the Alternate Base Rate is subject to a 1.00% floor and the Term SOFR Rate is subject to a 0.00% floor. 
The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants as well as customary negative covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens or grant negative pledges, make loans and investments, conduct certain transactions with affiliates, sell certain assets, enter into certain swap agreements, guarantee obligations of third parties, declare dividends or make certain distributions, and undergo a merger or consolidation or certain other transactions. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains certain customary events of default. Certain baskets and covenant levels have been adjusted and will apply equally to both the Term Loan and Revolving Facility for so long as the Term Loan is outstanding.
The obligations under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with respect to the Term Loan and the Revolving Facility are secured by substantially all of our assets, with certain exceptions set forth in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and are required to be guaranteed by certain material subsidiaries of the Company if, at the end of future financial quarters, certain conditions are not met.
During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, we incurred total commitment fees of $0.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, which are included in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
As of June 30, 2025, we had drawn the full amount of the Term Loan and had not drawn on the Revolving Facility, and we had $990.0 million total outstanding borrowings under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
In connection with the execution of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Term Loan was accounted for as a modification, extinguishment, or new loan for certain lenders in accordance with ASC 470-50. Accordingly, a discount and debt issuance costs of $10.0 million and $2.3 million, respectively, will be amortized to Interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Furthermore, we expensed $8.7 million of debt issuance costs incurred and wrote-off $7.5 million of previously 
56
deferred debt discount and debt issuance costs, which was included within Net gain on debt refinancing on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.
As of June 30, 2025, we had not drawn any amount under the Revolving Facility and as such did not have to test the financial covenants under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. We are required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of cash and cash equivalents as collateral for standby letters of credit. As of June 30, 2025, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $46.2 million, which are classified as Restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Upon entering into the Term Loan, the effective interest rate was 12.4% and the current effective interest rate as of June 30, 2025 is 10.9%.

Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities of $333.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 was primarily related to non-cash adjustments of $424.5 million and a net decrease in operating assets and liabilities of $27.4 million, partially offset by a net loss of $118.9 million. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of $229.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, $89.7 million of depreciation and amortization, $64.1 million of impairment expense, and $54.5 million of non-cash operating lease expense. The net decrease in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $136.5 million decrease in net inventory levels and a $66.6 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a $94.0 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a $82.3 million decrease in net operating lease liabilities due to lease payments and lease terminations as we continue to reduce our real estate footprint through our 2024 Restructuring Plan efforts.
The increase in cash flows from operating activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, was driven by operating expense reductions following the 2024 Restructuring Plan and gross profit improvements. 
Investing activities
Net cash used in investing activities of $5.1 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 was primarily related to $9.3 million used for capital expenditures, partially offset by $4.2 million in proceeds from the sale of the remaining Peloton Output Park land parcel.
The decrease in cash flows from investing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, was primarily due to less cash proceeds from the sale of the remaining Peloton Output Park land parcel during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 when compared to the proceeds received from the sale of Peloton Output Park and a manufacturing subsidiary in Taiwan during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, partially offset by fewer capital expenditures during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.
Financing activities
Net cash provided by financing activities of $1.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 was primarily related to net proceeds from option exercises under our employee stock plans and purchases under the ESPP of $11.8 million, partially offset by $10.0 million in principal repayments on the Term Loan.

The increase in cash flows from financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, was primarily due to less cash used in debt financing activities during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, as the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 included a $742.5 million payment on principal of our previous term loan and revolving credit facility, $724.9 million payment on a portion of the 2026 Notes, $986.9 million net proceeds from the issuance of the Term Loan, and $342.3 million net proceeds from the issuance of the 2029 Notes. This was partially offset by a reduction in proceeds from option exercises under our employee stock plans during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.

______________________
(1) Lease obligations relate to our office space, warehouses, production studios, retail locations, and equipment. The original lease terms are between one and 21 years, and the majority of the lease agreements are renewable at the end of the lease period. The Company has finance lease obligations of $0.3 million, also included above.
(2) We are subject to minimum royalty payments associated with our license agreements for the use of licensed content. See 
“Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business— 
We depend upon third-party licenses for the use of music in our content. An adverse change to, loss of, or claim that we do not hold necessary licenses may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.”
(3) Pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, we are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.500% or 0.375% per annum, depending on whether the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) is greater or less than 5.00 to 1.00, on a quarterly basis based on the unused portion of the Revolving Facility. The payments due by period in the table above are reflective of the rate as of June 30, 2025, which is 0.375%.
(4) Other purchase obligations include all other non-cancelable contractual obligations. These contracts are primarily related to cloud computing costs.
(5) Refer to 
Note 11, Debt
 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes and Term Loan obligations.
The commitment amounts in the table above are associated with contracts that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum services to be used, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions, and the approximate timing of the actions under the contracts.
We utilize contract manufacturers to build our products and accessories. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build products based on demand forecast information we supply, which typically covers a rolling 12-month period. Consistent with industry practice, we acquire inventories from such manufacturers through purchase orders against which orders are applied based on projected demand information and availability of goods. Such purchase commitments typically cover our forecasted product and manufacturing requirements for periods that range a number of months. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and/or adjust our requirements based on our business needs for a period of time before the order is due to be fulfilled. While our purchase orders are legally cancellable in many situations, some purchase orders are not cancellable in the event of a demand plan change or other circumstances, such as where the supplier has procured unique, Peloton-specific designs, and/or specific non-cancellable, non-returnable components based on our provided forecasts. 
As of June 30, 2025, our commitments to contract with third-party manufacturers for their inventory on-hand and component purchase commitments related to the manufacture of our products were estimated to be approximately $96.1 million. See 
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our operating results have been, and could in the future be, adversely affected if we are unable to accurately forecast consumer demand for our products and services and adequately manage our inventory
.”
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
We did not have any undisclosed off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2025.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See 
Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading 
“Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements”
 for a discussion about new accounting pronouncements adopted and not yet adopted as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, stockholders’ equity (deficit), revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We re-evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results may differ from these estimates and could differ based upon other assumptions or conditions. The critical accounting policies that reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include those noted below.
58
Inventory Valuation and Reserves
We review our inventory to ensure that its carrying value does not exceed its net realizable value (“NRV”), with NRV based on the estimated selling price of inventory in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion, disposal and transportation. When our expectations indicate that the carrying value of inventory may exceed its NRV, we calculate the approximate amount by which carrying value is greater than NRV and record a write-down for that difference as a component of Connected Fitness Products Cost of revenue. Once a write-down occurs, a new, lower cost basis is established. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and should our estimates used in these calculations change in the future, such as estimated selling prices or disposal costs, additional and potentially material write-downs may occur.
We also regularly monitor inventory quantities on-hand and in-transit and reserve for excess and obsolete inventories using estimates based on historical experience, historical and projected sales trends, specific categories of inventory, and age of on-hand inventory. Inventories presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are net of reserves for excess and obsolete inventory. If actual conditions or product demands are less favorable than our assumptions, additional inventory reserves may be required and could potentially be material. For additional information regarding these reserves, refer to 
Note 6, Inventories
, in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We review our long-lived asset groups for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of our long-lived asset groups are measured by comparing the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated from the asset group to the carrying value of the asset group. If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, the asset group’s fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow method. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. 
For our Connected Fitness Products segment and Subscription segment, we evaluate long-lived tangible assets at the lowest level at which independent cash flows can be identified, which is dependent on the strategy and expected future use of our long-lived assets. We evaluate corporate assets or other long-lived assets that are not segment-specific at the consolidated level.
We measure the fair value of an asset group based on market prices (i.e., the amount for which the asset could be sold to a third party) when available. When market prices are not available, we generally estimate the fair value of the asset group using the income approach and/or the market approach. The income approach uses cash flow projections. Inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plan forecasts, expected growth rates, and cost of capital, similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value. We also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other data. Significant judgments and estimates are included in the determination of the fair value of our right-of-use assets, including the expected downtime period to the commencement of future subleases, projected sublease income over the remaining lease period, and discount rates that reflect the level of risk associated with the expected future cash flows. 
Our estimates are subject to uncertainty and may be affected by a number of factors outside our control, including general economic conditions and the competitive environment. Unforeseen events, changes in circumstances and market conditions, and changes in assumptions and estimates of future cash flows could adversely affect the fair value of our long-lived asset groups and could result in future impairment charges.
During fiscal 2023, 2024 and 2025, management identified various qualitative factors that collectively indicated that the Company had impairment triggering events, including (i) realignment of cost structure in connection with the restructuring initiatives, (ii) softening demand and (iii) significant decrease in the market price of certain long-lived asset groups. For details regarding the impairment charges recognized as a result of these triggering events, refer to 
Note 7, Property and Equipment
, and 
Note 10, Leases
, in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Loss Contingencies
We are, or may become, a party to legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax, and government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. These estimates have been based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances at each balance sheet date and are subject to change based on new information and future events. For the matters we disclose in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, estimating such an amount is not possible or is immaterial.
The outcomes of our legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and until the final resolution of any such matter, there may be exposure to a material loss in excess of the amount recorded. Given that our legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax, and government inquiries and investigations are subject to uncertainty, there can be no assurance that such legal proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For additional information regarding these contingencies, refer to 
Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies
, in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Product Warranty and Recall Related Provisions
Product warranty costs are recognized as a component of Connected Fitness Products Cost of revenue upon the transfer of control of our Connected Fitness Products to our customers. We estimate our product warranty obligation based on factors including historical and current product failure rates, historical service delivery and replacement costs, and warranty policies and business practices. Product warranty obligations are reviewed and adjusted quarterly to ensure that accruals are adequate to meet expected future warranty obligations. 
59
We accrue cost of product recalls and other potential corrective actions based on management’s estimate of when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated, which occurs when management commits to either a corrective action plan or quality improvement plan, or when required by regulatory requirements. These costs are recognized in Connected Fitness Products Cost of revenue, which may include the cost of the development of the product being replaced, logistics costs, and other related costs such as product scrap cost, inventory write-down and cancellation of any supplier commitments. The accrued cost is based on management’s estimate of the cost to repair each affected product and the estimated number of products to be repaired based on actions taken by the impacted customers. 
Estimating future product warranty and recall related provisions is highly subjective and requires significant management judgment. Based on information that is currently available, management believes that the product warranty and recall related provisions are adequate, however it is possible that substantial additional charges may be required in future periods based on new information, changes in facts and circumstances, and actions we may commit to or be required to undertake. 
Music Royalty Fees
To secure the rights to use music in our content, we enter into agreements to obtain licenses from rights holders such as performing rights organizations, record labels, music publishers, collecting societies, artists and songwriters, and other copyright owners (or their agents). Music royalty fees are calculated using negotiated rates in accordance with our license agreements or estimates of those rates where rights holders are not identified, which may involve significant judgment, assumptions, and estimates in addition to a significant volume of data to be processed and analyzed.
Certain of our license agreements contain payment guarantees. We rely on estimates to forecast whether guaranteed payments against royalties will be fully recouped against our actual content costs incurred over the term of the license agreement. To the extent that our content costs do not exceed such guaranteed payments, incremental music royalty fees may need to be expensed over the period we determine the guaranteed payment is no longer deemed recoverable.
The process of obtaining licenses involves identifying and negotiating with many rights holders, some of whom are unknown, or difficult to identify, or for whom we may have conflicting ownership information, and this can generate a myriad of complex and evolving legal issues across many jurisdictions, including open questions of law as to when and whether particular licenses are needed. As such, we may be required to estimate music royalty fees based on comparable contractual rates and our best estimate of usage of a licensor. These estimates are subject to change based on several factors, including new observable data from license negotiations and the execution of new license agreements.
Some of our license agreements also include so-called “most-favored nations” provisions, which require that certain terms (including material financial terms) are no less favorable than those provided to any similarly situated licensor. If agreements are amended or new agreements are entered into on more favorable terms with another licensor, these most-favored nations provisions could cause our payment or other obligations to escalate substantially. If a license agreement contains a most-favored nations provision, a reserve is established based on the “most-favored” rates within the market.
Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Interest Rate Risk
We had Cash and cash equivalents of $1,039.5 million as of June 30, 2025. The primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of capital, and we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. We have not been exposed, nor do we anticipate being exposed, to material risks due to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates during any of the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
We are primarily exposed to changes in short-term interest rates with respect to our cost of borrowing under our Term Loan. We monitor our cost of borrowing under our facilities, taking into account our funding requirements, and our expectations for short-term rates in the future. A hypothetical 10% change in the interest rate on our Term Loan for all periods presented would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Foreign Currency Risk
Our international sales are primarily denominated in foreign currencies and any unfavorable movement in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and the currencies in which we conduct sales in foreign countries could have an adverse impact on our revenue. We source and manufacture inventory primarily in U.S. dollars and Taiwanese dollars. A portion of our operating expenses is incurred outside the United States and are denominated in foreign currencies, which are also subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, some of our contract manufacturing takes place in Taiwan and the related agreements are denominated in foreign currencies and not in U.S. dollars. Further, certain of our manufacturing agreements provide for fixed costs of our Connected Fitness Products and hardware in Taiwanese dollars but provide for payment in U.S. dollars based on the then-current Taiwanese dollar to U.S. dollar spot rate. In addition, our suppliers incur many costs, including labor and supply costs, in other currencies. While we are not currently contractually obligated to pay increased costs due to changes in exchange rates, to the extent that exchange rates move unfavorably for our suppliers, they may seek to pass these additional costs on to us, which could have a material impact on our gross margins. Our operating results and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We have the ability to use derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forwards, and have the ability to use option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates historically has been partially hedged as our foreign currency denominated inflows create a natural hedge against our foreign currency denominated expenses.
60
Inflation Risk
As a result of inflationary conditions, there have been and may continue to be additional pressures on the ongoing increases in supply chain and logistics costs, materials costs, and labor costs. The effect of U.S. and global tariffs may spur inflationary conditions and create further pressures on costs. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we have recently experienced the effects of inflation on our results of operations and financial condition. Our business may continue to be impacted by inflation in the future which could have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue if we are unable to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Additionally, because we purchase component parts from our suppliers, we may be adversely impacted by their inability to adequately mitigate inflationary, industry, tariffs, or economic pressures.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Peloton Interactive, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Peloton Interactive, Inc. (the Company) as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated August 7, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.
63
Existence of Inventory
Description of the Matter
At June 30, 2025 the Company held $205.6 million of inventory across its distribution centers in the United States, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Austria, including $40.3 million of finished goods inventory in transit. As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, inventories consist of finished goods and raw materials.

Auditing the existence of inventory involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the dispersion of inventory across numerous leased and operated and contracted third-party logistics provider distribution centers, as well as finished goods inventory in transit. This results in a high degree of auditor judgment in determining the extent of procedures to be performed in order to validate the existence of inventory. For example, there is judgment required in determining the sample of distribution centers at which to perform testing procedures.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
To test the existence of inventory at the balance sheet date, our audit procedures included, among others, performing test counts of inventory items at a sample of leased and operated distribution centers and performing procedures to confirm and test inventory quantities held by third-party logistics providers. We compared our test counts and the quantities confirmed by the third parties to the Company’s records. We also tested finished goods inventory in transit and inventory cutoff at the inventory count date by comparing related third-party shipping documentation to the Company’s records.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Peloton Interactive, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Peloton Interactive, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Peloton Interactive, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, and the related notes and our report dated August 7, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in millions, except share and per share amounts)
1. 
Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
Description and Organization
Peloton Interactive, Inc. (“Peloton” or the “Company”) is a leading global fitness and wellness company that empowers its Members to live fit, strong, long, and happy by providing fitness and wellness products and services they can use anytime, anywhere. Peloton has a highly engaged community of Members, which the Company defines as any individual who has a Peloton account through a paid Connected Fitness Subscription or a paid App Subscription, inclusive of the Peloton App+, App One and Strength+ Memberships (the “Peloton Apps”), and engages in one or more workouts in the trailing 12-month period. As a category innovator at the nexus of fitness and wellness, technology, and media, the Company delivers experiences through Peloton’s world-renowned Instructors, premium hardware and innovative software, personalization, and extensive modalities and content formats.
The Company’s Connected Fitness Products portfolio includes the Peloton Bike, Bike+, Tread, Tread+, Guide (discontinued as of July 2025), Row, and various Precor products. Access to the Peloton Apps is available with an All-Access or Guide Membership for Members who have Connected Fitness Products or through standalone App Memberships (App+, App One, or Strength+). Access to the Strength+ App is available with an All-Access, Guide, or App+ Membership or through a standalone Strength+ subscription. The Company’s revenue is generated primarily from recurring Subscription revenue and the sale of its Connected Fitness Products. The Company defines a “Paid Connected Fitness Subscription” as a person, household, or commercial property, such as a hotel or residential building, that has paid for a subscription to a Connected Fitness Product (a Connected Fitness Subscription with a successful credit card billing or with prepaid subscription credits or waivers). “Paid App Subscriptions” include all App+, App One, or Strength+ subscriptions for which the Company currently receives payment.
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Peloton Interactive, Inc. and its subsidiaries in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
Certain monetary amounts, percentages, and other figures included elsewhere in these financial statements have been subject to rounding adjustments. Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the figures that precede them, and figures expressed as percentages in the text may not total 100% or, as applicable, when aggregated may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the percentages that precede them.
Except as described elsewhere in 
Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 in the section titled 
“Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements,”
 there have been no material changes to the Company’s significant accounting policies as described in the Form 10-K.
71
2. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including, among others, those related to revenue related reserves, product recall and corrective action cost, the realizability of inventory, collectability of receivables, fair value measurements, the incremental borrowing rate associated with lease liabilities, impairment of long-lived assets, useful lives of long-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, product warranty, goodwill, accounting for income taxes, stock-based compensation expense, standalone selling price and transaction price estimates, future restructuring charges, and commitments and contingencies. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all cash and short-term investments purchased with maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were primarily held in money market and operating accounts. At various times during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, the balances of cash at financial institutions exceeded the federally insured limit. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes its cash and cash equivalents are not subject to any significant credit risk.
Accounts Receivable, Net of Allowances
The Company's accounts receivable primarily represent amounts due from third-party retailers and commercial sales and amounts due from third-party payment processors. Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount less allowances for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is based upon a number of factors, including the length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company's previous loss history, the specific customer's ability to pay its obligation and any other forward-looking data regarding customers' ability to pay which may be available.
Inventories
Inventories consist of finished goods and raw materials. Finished goods are primarily purchased from contract manufacturers. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. For Peloton-branded Connected Fitness products, accessories, apparel, and raw materials, cost is determined using a weighted-average cost method. For Precor-branded fitness products and raw materials, cost is determined using a first-in, first-out basis. Adjustments to reduce inventory to net realizable value are recognized in Connected Fitness Products Cost of revenue. The Company periodically assesses and adjusts the value of inventory for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates of future demand and market conditions, as well as damaged or otherwise impaired goods. The Company may be required to write down the value of inventory if estimates of future demand and market conditions indicate excess and/or obsolete inventory. Inventory write-downs are recorded as a component of Connected Fitness Products Cost of revenue. Spare parts are recorded as inventory and recognized in cost of revenue as consumed.
 Refer to 
Note 6
, 
Inventories
 for additional information.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment purchased by the Company are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any. Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of those leasehold improvements and the remaining lease term. Depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the corresponding cost of revenue or operating expense categories on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Charges for repairs and maintenance that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed as incurred.
 Refer to 
Note 7, Property and Equipment
 for additional information.
Internal-Use Software
The Company capitalizes certain qualified costs incurred in connection with the development of internal-use software. The Company evaluates the costs incurred during the application development stage of internal use software and website development to determine whether the costs meet the criteria for capitalization. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities including maintenance are expensed as incurred. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, not to exceed 
three years
. Capitalized costs less accumulated amortization are included within Property and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (“triggering events”) indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted net future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value, which is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow method.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognized for non-controlling interest, if any, over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. 
72
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually on April 1 of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. In conducting its annual impairment test, the Company first reviews qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If factors indicate that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company performs a quantitative assessment and the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by analyzing the expected present value of future cash flows. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss equal to the excess is recorded.
Intangible assets other than goodwill are comprised of acquired developed technology and other finite-lived intangible assets. At initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition are recognized at their fair value as of the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at acquisition date fair value less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any, and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. The Company has 
no
 intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.
The Company assesses the impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Refer to 
Note 8, Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
for additional information.
Restricted Cash
The Company’s Restricted cash primarily relates to cash used to collateralize outstanding letters of credit.
Leases
Lessee arrangements
The Company leases facilities under operating leases with various expiration dates through 2039. The Company leases space for its corporate headquarters and the operation of its production studio facilities, distribution facilities, warehouses, retail locations, and other office spaces. The Company does not have any material finance leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception and records the leases in its financial statements upon lease commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for use by the lessor.
Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are established on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for leases with an expected term greater than one year. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the fixed and determinable lease payments not yet paid, less any lease incentives payable to the Company. Right-of-use assets are recognized based on the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any initial direct costs incurred by the Company and any lease payments made to the landlord at or before lease commencement, minus any lease incentives received. As the rate implicit in the lease is not determinable, the Company uses its secured incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and has elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for its real estate and equipment leases. Non-lease components include fixed payments for common area maintenance, utilities, insurance, and other costs.
The Company recognizes lease expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The Company's lease terms include options to extend or terminate the underlying lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The operating lease arrangements included in the measurement of lease liabilities do not reflect options to extend or terminate, as management does not consider the exercise of these options to be reasonably certain. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to lease payments based on an index or rate. The Company calculates the present value of future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date for new leases. Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred. Variable lease payments include, but are not limited to, percentage of sales, common area charges, taxes paid by the landlord that are charged to the Company, and changes to the consumer price index. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred.
The Company subleases certain corporate offices, warehouses and distribution facilities, and retail locations to third parties, which does not relieve the Company of its primary lease obligations with the lessor (the “head lease”). These subleases are classified as operating leases, and therefore the Company continues to account for the head lease as it did before the commencement date of the sublease. The Company recognizes sublease income on a straight-line basis over the sublease term. Variable lease payments include, but are not limited to, common area charges, real estate taxes, and utilities, and are recognized as variable sublease income in the period in which they are earned. Sublease income is presented within the same category of operating expenses as the underlying head lease expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. If the lease cost for the term of the sublease exceeds the Company’s anticipated sublease income for the same period, the Company assesses the right-of-use asset associated with the head lease for impairment under the long-lived asset impairment provisions of ASC 360. 
Lessor arrangements
The Company leases Peloton Bike portfolio products under the Peloton Rental program. The lease arrangement provides the customer with an option to purchase the underlying equipment or terminate the lease at any time. The price to purchase the underlying equipment is determined based on the number of months that the customer has leased the equipment, and is not considered a bargain purchase option. All Peloton Rental lease agreements are considered operating leases, and the Company currently does not have any sales-type or direct financing leases as a lessor. Refer to

Convertible Senior Notes
In February 2021, the Company issued in a private offering $
1.0
 billion aggregate principal amount of 
0.00
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the "2026 Notes"), including the initial purchasers’ exercise in full of their option to purchase additional notes, of which $
801.0
 million aggregate principal amount was repurchased in May 2024.
In May 2024, the Company issued in a private offering $
350.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
5.50
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”), including the initial purchasers’ exercise in full of the option to purchase additional notes.
The 2026 Notes and 2029 Notes are accounted for in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Subtopic 470-20, 
Debt with Conversion and Other Options
. Pursuant to ASC Subtopic 470-20, debt with an embedded conversion feature shall be accounted for in its entirety as a liability and no portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debt instrument shall be accounted for as attributable to the conversion feature unless the conversion feature is required to be accounted for separately as an embedded derivative or the conversion feature results in a premium that is subject to the guidance in ASC 470. 
The 2026 Notes and the 2029 Notes (together, “the Notes”) are accounted for as a liability with no portion of the proceeds attributable to the conversion options as the conversion feature did not require separate accounting as a derivative, and the Notes did not involve a premium subject to the guidance in ASC 470. 
Refer to 
Note 11, Debt
 for additional information.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Subsequent changes in fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income when they occur. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurement or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and credit risk.
The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:
•
Level 1 inputs are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•
Level 2 inputs are based on observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
•
Level 3 inputs are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of fair value of assets or liabilities, and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
The Company’s material financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, Term Loan (as defined in 
Note 11, Debt
), and the convertible senior notes. The carrying values of the Company’s accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximated their fair values at June 30, 2025 and 2024, due to the short period of time to maturity or repayment. Refer to 
Note 5, Fair Value Measurements
 for additional information.
Loss Contingencies
Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties, and other sources are recorded when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If a loss is reasonably possible, but not probable, and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated, or if a loss is probable and the loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, the Company discloses the nature of the contingency and an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss or states that such an estimate cannot be made.
 Refer to 
Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies
 for additional information.
Revenue Recognition
The Company’s primary sources of revenue are its recurring content Subscription revenue and revenue from sales of its Connected Fitness Products and related accessories, as well as Precor-branded fitness products, delivery and installation services.
The Company determines revenue recognition through the following steps:
•
Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;
•
Identification of the performance obligations in the contract;
•
Determination of the transaction price;
•
Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
•
Recognition of revenue when, or as, the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
74
Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The Company’s revenue is reported net of sales returns and concessions, discounts and allowances, incentives, and rebates to commercial distributors as a reduction of the transaction price. Certain contracts include consideration payable that is accounted for as a payment for distinct goods or services. An estimated amount of variable consideration is included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized would not occur once the uncertainty is resolved. The Company’s transaction price estimate includes its estimate for product returns and concessions based on the terms and conditions of home trial programs, historical return trends by product category, impact of seasonality, an evaluation of current economic and market conditions, and current business practices, and the Company records the expected customer refund liability as a reduction to revenue, and the expected inventory right to return asset as a reduction of cost of revenue. If actual return costs differ from previous estimates, the amount of the liability and corresponding revenue are adjusted in the period in which such costs occur.
For customer contracts that include multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for individual performance obligations if they are distinct. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. The Company generally determines the standalone selling price based on the prices charged to customers.
The Company applies the practical expedient as per ASC 606-10-50-14, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 and does not disclose information related to remaining performance obligations due to their original expected terms being one year or less. 
The Company applies the practical expedient as per ASC 340-40-25-4, 
Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers
 and expenses sales commissions when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. These costs are recorded in Sales and marketing in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
Some of the Company’s revenues relate to arrangements for Peloton Bike portfolio rental products. The Peloton Rental program allows Members to lease Peloton Bike portfolio products with a Peloton Rental Membership for a single monthly cost and a one-time delivery fee, and gives the Member the option to purchase the equipment outright or cancel at any time with no penalty. These lease arrangements include both lease and non-lease components. Consideration is allocated between the lease and non-lease components based on management’s best estimate of the relative standalone selling price of each component. The lease component relates to the customer’s right to use the equipment over the lease term and is accounted for as an operating lease in accordance with ASC 842, 
Leases
. Lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease within Connected Fitness Products Revenue, while the underlying customer-leased equipment remains within Property and equipment, net on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and depreciates over the equipment’s useful life. Depreciation expense associated with the underlying equipment is reflected in Connected Fitness Products Cost of revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Non-lease components primarily consist of an All-Access Membership, which is recognized ratably over the subscription term within Subscription Revenue.
Connected Fitness Products
Connected Fitness Products include the Company’s portfolio of Connected Fitness Products and related accessories, Precor-branded fitness products, delivery and installation services, Peloton Bike portfolio rental products, extended warranty agreements, branded apparel, and commercial service contracts. The Company recognizes Connected Fitness Products Revenue net of sales returns and concessions, discounts and allowances, and third-party financing program fees, when the product has been delivered to the customer, except for extended warranty revenue that is recognized ratably over the warranty coverage period and service revenue that is recognized over the term of the service contract. The Company generally allows customers to return Peloton branded Connected Fitness Products within 
thirty days
 of purchase, as stated in its return policy.
The Company records fees paid to third-party financing partners in connection with its consumer financing program as a reduction of revenue, as it considers such costs to be a customer sales incentive. The Company records payment processing fees for its credit card sales for Connected Fitness Products within Sales and marketing in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
Subscription
The Company’s subscriptions provide access to Peloton content and its library of live and on-demand fitness classes. The Company’s subscriptions are offered on a month-to-month or prepaid basis.
Amounts paid for subscription fees, net of refunds are included within Deferred revenue and customer deposits on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognized ratably over the subscription term. The Company records payment processing fees for its monthly subscription charges within Subscription Cost of revenue in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
Sales tax collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities is not included in revenue and is reflected as a liability on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Cost of Revenue
Connected Fitness Products
Connected Fitness Products Cost of revenue consists of the Company’s portfolio of Connected Fitness Products, related accessories, Precor-branded fitness products, and branded apparel product costs, including third party manufacturing costs, duties and other applicable importing costs, shipping and handling costs, packaging, warranty replacement and service costs, fulfillment costs, warehousing costs, costs related to the Company’s commercial business, depreciation of property and equipment, and certain costs related to management, facilities, and personnel-
75
related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, associated with supply chain logistics. Inventory write-downs and related obsolescence reserve expense are also included within Connected Fitness Products Cost of revenue.  
Subscription
Subscription Cost of revenue includes costs associated with content creation and costs to stream content to Members. These costs consist of both fixed costs, including Instructor and production personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, depreciation of property and equipment, studio rent and occupancy, and other studio overhead, as well as variable costs, including music royalty fees, third-party platform streaming costs, and payment processing fees for monthly subscription billings.
Music Royalty Fees
The Company has entered into agreements with music rights holders for the music included in the operation of Peloton’s service. The Company pays and recognizes music royalty fees in accordance with the terms of the relevant license agreement with the music rights holder. This can include royalties incurred for paid subscriptions and royalties incurred as part of free-trial offers, which are recognized within Subscription Cost of revenue and Sales and marketing in the Company’s Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, respectively. The Company has certain license agreements whereby music royalty fees are subject to payment guarantees. When a guaranteed payment is made in advance, the amount is recorded as a prepaid asset and amortized over the shorter of the period consumed or the term of the license agreement. When actual music royalty fees to be incurred during a contractual period are expected to fall short of the guaranteed payment, the expected under-recoupment is expensed pro-rata across the contractual period.
Some of the Company’s license agreements also include so-called “most-favored nations” provisions, which require that certain terms (including material financial terms) are no less favorable than those provided to any similarly situated licensor. When it is probable that the Company will incur incremental music royalty fees under a most-favored nations provision, a liability is established within Accounts payable and accrued expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Given the at times migratory, uncertain, or opaque nature of music rights ownership, the Company’s archived library may continue to include music for which certain rights or fractional interests have unknowingly changed and require updated licensing. Prior to the execution of a music license agreement, the Company estimates and records a charge based upon license agreements previously entered into and the respective music rights holdings.
Advertising Costs
Advertising and other promotional costs to market the Company's products are expensed as incurred.
 Advertising expenses were $
247.0
 million, $
435.0
 million, and $
362.6
 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and are included within Sales and marketing expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
Research and Development Costs
Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation expense, and facilities-related expenses, consulting and contractor expenses, tooling and prototype materials, software platform expenses, and depreciation of property and equipment. Substantially all of the Company’s research and development expenses are related to developing new products and services and improving existing products and services. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Certain qualified costs incurred in connection with the development of internal-use software are capitalized that may also cause research and development expenses to vary from period to period.
Stock-Based Compensation
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In August 2019, the Company's Board of Directors ("Board of Directors") adopted the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"), which was subsequently approved by the Company’s stockholders in September 2019. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to shares issued pursuant to its ESPP on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is 
twenty-four months
. The ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company's Class A common stock at a 
15
 percent discount through accumulated payroll deductions. The ESPP became effective on September 25, 2019, the date the registration statement filed in connection with the Company’s initial public offering was declared effective by the SEC (the “Effective Date”). The number of shares of Class A common stock that are available for issuance and sale to eligible employees under the ESPP will increase automatically on the first day of each fiscal year of the Company beginning on July 1, 2020 through 2029, in an amount equal to 
1
% of the total number of outstanding shares of all classes of the Company's common stock on the immediately preceding June 30, or such lesser number as may be determined by the Board of Directors or applicable committee in its sole discretion. On July 1, 2024, the number of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the ESPP was automatically increased according to its terms by 
3,762,617
 shares. As of June 30, 2025, a total of 
18,133,477
 shares of Class A common stock were available for sale to employees under the ESPP.
Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, each offering period will consist of 
four

six-month
 purchase periods, commencing on September 1 and March 1 and ending on August 31 and February 28 of each 
two-year
 period or each 
six-month
 period, respectively, subject to a reset provision. If the closing price of Class A common stock on the first day of an offering period is higher than the closing price of Class A common stock on the last day of any applicable purchase period, participants will be withdrawn from the ongoing offering period immediately following the purchase of ESPP shares on the purchase date and would automatically be enrolled in the subsequent offering period (“ESPP reset”), resulting in a modification under ASC 718, 
Compensation - Stock Compensation
.
76
Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, the purchase price for each share of Class A common stock purchased under the ESPP will be 
85
% of the lower of the fair market value per share on the first trading day of the applicable offering period or the fair market value per share on the last trading day of the applicable purchase period.
The Company estimates the fair value of shares expected to be purchased at the commencement of the ESPP offering periods using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company estimates the expected term based on each offering period's respective purchase date. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the price of Class A common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected dividend yield is zero as the Company has not paid and does not currently anticipate paying dividends on its common stock.
2019 Equity Incentive Plan
In August 2019, the Board of Directors adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan ("the 2019 Plan"), which was subsequently approved by the Company’s stockholders in September 2019. Stock-based awards are measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and are recognized as expense, net of actual forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. For stock option and restricted stock unit grants, vesting generally occurs over 
two
 to 
four years
. Stock option grants are not exercisable after the expiration of 
ten years
 from the date of grant or such shorter period as specified in a stock award agreement. Restricted stock units are generally granted with a service condition only or both a service and performance condition. 
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, the Company granted performance-based restricted stock units to certain members of management. The performance-based restricted stock units generally cliff vest, if earned, two and one-half months after the end of the fiscal year. The number of shares that can be earned generally ranges from 
0
% to 
200
% of the target number based on the achievement of the performance condition over the respective measurement period. For performance-based awards issued, the value of the instrument is measured at the grant date as the fair value of the award and expensed over the vesting term under an accelerated attribution method when the performance targets are considered probable of being achieved. 
The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The determination of the grant date fair value of stock awards issued is affected by a number of variables, including the fair value of the Company’s common stock, the expected common stock price volatility over the expected life of the awards, the expected term of the stock option, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of the Company’s common stock. The expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the price of Class A common stock. The Company estimates the expected term based on the simplified method for employee stock options considered to be “plain vanilla” options, as the Company’s historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected dividend yield is 
0.0
% as the Company has not paid and does not currently anticipate paying dividends on its common stock.
The 2019 Plan serves as the successor to the 2015 Stock Plan. The 2015 Stock Plan continues to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards previously granted thereunder. Any reserved shares not issued or subject to outstanding grants under the 2015 Plan on the effective date of the 2019 Plan became available for grant under the 2019 Plan and will be issued as Class A common stock. Generally, the 2015 Stock Plan permitted the early exercise of stock options granted prior to the IPO. The unvested portion of shares exercised was recorded within Other current liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and reclassified to equity as vesting occurred. 
The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan will increase automatically on July 1 of each of 2020 through 2029 by the number of shares of Class A common stock equal to 
5
% of the total outstanding shares of all of the Company’s classes of common stock as of each June 30 immediately preceding the date of increase (the “evergreen feature”), or a lesser amount as determined by the Board of Directors. On July 1, 2024, the number of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the 2019 Plan was automatically increased according to its terms by 
18,813,085
 shares.
In October 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the 2019 Plan (the “Amendment”) that increases the number of shares available under the 2019 Plan by 
36,000,000
 shares of Class A common stock (and retains the existing evergreen feature through July 1, 2029) and extends the right to grant awards under the 2019 Plan through October 24, 2033.  The Amendment became effective following approval by the Company’s stockholders on December 7, 2023. As of June 30, 2025, 
61,874,557
 shares of Class A common stock were available for future award under the 2019 Plan.
Common Stock
The holder of each share of Class A common stock is entitled to 
one
 vote, while the holder of each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 
twenty
 votes. Each outstanding share of the Company’s Class B common stock is convertible into an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock and generally convert into shares of Class A common stock upon transfer.
Defined Contribution Plan
The Company maintains a defined contribution retirement plan offered to all of its U.S. employees, as well as plans at certain foreign and domestic subsidiaries. For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, the Company's matching contributions totaled $
14.5
 million, $
18.5
 million, and $
19.1
 million, respectively, and were expensed as contributed.
Restructuring
The Company's restructuring charges consist of employee severance and other personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense, one-time termination benefits and ongoing benefits related to the reduction of its workforce, professional services, facility closures and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities. One-time termination benefits are expensed when the plan of termination has been communicated to the employee, unless the employee must provide future service beyond a minimum retention period, in which case the benefits 
77
are expensed ratably over the future service period. Ongoing benefits are expensed when it is probable that the employee is entitled to the severance benefits and the benefit amounts are reasonably estimable. Other costs primarily consist of termination fees, idle rent and related expenses for exited locations, professional services, and other costs related to restructuring activities, and are expensed when incurred.
 Refer to 
Note 4, Restructuring
 for additional information.
Foreign Currency
The Company’s reporting currency is the U.S. dollar while the functional currencies of non-U.S. subsidiaries are determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, revenues and expenses are translated using average rates for the period, and equity is translated using historical rates. Change in foreign currency translation adjustments is included in Other comprehensive (loss) income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, and in Accumulated other comprehensive income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit). Transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary and are included in Foreign exchange (loss) gain on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
Income Taxes
The Company utilizes the asset and liability method for computing its income tax provision, which consists primarily of income taxes related to state and international taxes for jurisdictions in which the Company conducts business. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss, capital loss, and tax credit carryforwards, using enacted tax rates. Management makes estimates, assumptions, and judgments to determine the Company’s provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent the Company believes recovery of its deferred tax assets is not more-likely-than-not, a valuation allowance is established. A valuation allowance is maintained on the majority of the Company’s deferred tax assets as the Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred assets will not be utilized.
The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company utilizes a two-step approach to recognize and measure unrecognized tax benefits. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon tax authority examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, which to date have not been material, are recognized within Income tax expense (benefit) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
 Refer to 
Note 15, Income Taxes
 for additional information.
Earnings (Loss) Per Share
The Company computes basic earnings (loss) per share based on the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Potential shares of common stock consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options, ESPP shares to be issued, vesting of restricted stock units and awards, and performance-based restricted stock units, when the related performance criterion has been met, using the treasury stock method, and convertible senior notes, using the if-converted method.

Note 16, Net Loss Per Share

Restructuring
In February 2022, the Company announced and began implementing a restructuring plan (the “2022 Restructuring Plan”) and in April 2024, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new restructuring plan to expand upon its 2022 Restructuring Plan (as expanded and collectively with the 2022 Restructuring Plan, the “2024 Restructuring Plan”). 
In August 2025, the Company announced a new restructuring plan (the “2025 Restructuring Plan”), which includes a reduction in global headcount and is intended to improve the Company’s cost structure, operating efficiency, and profitability, while providing the opportunity to return to growth by reinvesting savings into Peloton’s differentiating capabilities. The Company expects the Restructuring Plans to be substantially implemented by the end of fiscal year 2026, which is subject to change.
As of June 30, 2025, actions pursuant to our 2024 Restructuring Plan, which includes any remaining restructuring activity under the original 2022 Restructuring Plan, have been substantially completed. As such, any remaining charges under these plans are included within the 2025 Restructuring Plan.
In connection with the 2025 Restructuring Plan, the Company estimates that it will incur additional cash restructuring charges of approximately $
50.0
 million, primarily comprised of location strategy costs, lease termination costs, and other exit costs. Additionally, the Company expects to recognize additional non-cash restructuring charges of approximately $
10.0
 million, primarily comprised of asset write-downs and write-offs, in connection with the continued exit of the Company’s retail and other leased locations. The Company expects these charges to be substantially incurred by the end of fiscal year 2026, which is subject to change.
80
As a result of these restructuring initiatives, the Company incurred the charges shown in the following table. Asset write-downs and write-offs are included within Impairment expense, Write-offs of inventory related to restructuring activities are included within Connected Fitness Products Cost of revenue, and the remaining charges incurred during the relevant periods are included within Restructuring expense, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss:

Due to the actions taken pursuant to the Restructuring Plans, the Company tested certain long-lived assets (asset groups) for recoverability by comparing the carrying values of the asset group to estimates of their future undiscounted cash flows, which were generally the liquidation value, or for operating lease right-of-use assets, income from a sublease arrangement. Based on the results of the recoverability tests, the Company determined that during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, the undiscounted cash flows of certain assets (asset groups) were below their carrying values, indicating impairment. The assets were written down to their estimated fair values, which were determined based on their estimated liquidation or sales value, or for operating lease right-of-use assets, discounted cash flows of a sublease arrangement.

Debt
Convertible Notes due 2029
In May 2024, the Company issued $
350.0
 million aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Notes in a private offering, including the exercise in full of the option granted to the initial purchasers to purchase $
50.0
 million of the 2029 Notes. The 2029 Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture (the “2029 Notes Indenture”) between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. The 2029 Notes bear interest at a rate of 
5.50
% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2024. The net proceeds from this offering of 2029 Notes were approximately $
342.3
 million, after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and commissions of $
7.7
 million.
Each $1,000 principal amount of the 2029 Notes is initially convertible into 218.4360 shares of Class A common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
4.58
 per share. The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the 2029 Notes Indenture. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change occur or the Company elects to redeem the 2029 Notes, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time.
The 2029 Notes will mature on December 1, 2029, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. The 2029 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at certain times and upon the occurrence of certain events. A holder may convert its 2029 Notes during any calendar quarter if the last reported sale price per share of the Class A common stock exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price for each of at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. The last reported sale price of the Class A common stock exceeded 
130
% of the conversion price of the 2029 Notes for more than 
20
 trading days during the 
30
 consecutive trading days, including the last trading day, ended June 30, 2025. Accordingly, as of July 1, 2025, the 2029 Notes may be converted at the option of the applicable holder through September 30, 2025.
On or after September 1, 2029, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their 2029 Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the applicable holder. 
The Company may satisfy any conversion obligation under the 2029 Notes by paying and/or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Class A common stock, at the Company’s election, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the 2029 Notes Indenture. If all of the 2029 Notes were to be converted prior to September 30, 2025, the Company’s current intention would be to settle such conversion in shares of the Class A common stock.
The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion (subject to the partial redemption limitation described in the 2029 Notes Indenture) of the 2029 Notes, at its option, on or after June 7, 2027 and on or before the 20th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, if the last reported sale price per share of the Class A common stock exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price then in effect on (1) each of at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption and (2) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such notice at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the 2029 Notes, which means that the Company is not required to redeem or retire the 2029 Notes periodically.
Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the 2029 Notes Indenture), subject to certain conditions, holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 2029 Notes for cash at a price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2029 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The definition of fundamental change includes certain business combination transactions involving the Company and certain de-listing events with respect to the Company’s common stock.
The 2029 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2029 Notes; equal in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness; and structurally subordinated to all existing and 
87
future indebtedness and other liabilities of current or future subsidiaries of the Company (including trade payables and to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof, preferred equity, if any, of the Company’s subsidiaries).
The effective interest rate upon issuance of the 2029 Notes was 
5.97
%, which is the effective interest rate as of June 30, 2025.

Convertible Notes due 2026
In February 2021, the Company issued $
1.0
 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes in a private offering, including the exercise in full of the option granted to the initial purchasers to purchase $
125.0
 million of the 2026 Notes. The 2026 Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture (the “2026 Notes Indenture”) between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $
977.2
 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and the Company’s offering expenses. The 2026 Notes do not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the 2026 Notes does not accrete.
Each $1,000 principal amount of the 2026 Notes is initially convertible into 4.1800 shares of Class A common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
239.23
 per share. The conversion rate is subject to customary adjustments under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the 2026 Notes Indenture. In addition, if certain corporate events that constitute a make-whole fundamental change occur or the Company elects to redeem the 2026 Notes, then the conversion rate will, in certain circumstances, be increased for a specified period of time.
The 2026 Notes will mature on February 15, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. The 2026 Notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at certain times and upon the occurrence of certain events. As of June 30, 2025, the 2026 Notes are classified as Current portion of debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets due to their upcoming maturity date.
On or after August 15, 2025, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their 2026 Notes, in multiples of $1,000 principal amount, at the option of the holder. Upon conversion, the Company may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying and/or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of Class A common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock, at the Company’s election, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions provided in the 2026 Notes Indenture. 
The Company may redeem for cash all or any portion (subject to the partial redemption limitation described in the 2026 Notes Indenture) of the 2026 Notes, at its option, on or before the 20th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, if the last reported sale price per share of the Class A common stock exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price then in effect on (1) each of at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption and (2) the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such notice at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the 2026 Notes, which means that the Company is not required to redeem or retire the 2026 Notes periodically.
Upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the 2026 Notes Indenture), subject to certain conditions, holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 2026 Notes for cash at a price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid special interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The definition of fundamental change includes certain business combination transactions involving the Company and certain de-listing events with respect to the Company’s common stock.
88
The 2026 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank senior in right of payment to any of the Company’s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 2026 Notes; equal in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness; and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of current or future subsidiaries of the Company (including trade payables and to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof, preferred equity, if any, of the Company’s subsidiaries).
Repurchase of a Portion of the 2026 Convertible Notes
In May 2024, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of the 2026 Notes to repurchase $
801.0
 million of aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes for an aggregate of $
724.9
 million of cash. The Company accounted for this repurchase of the 2026 Notes as a debt extinguishment under ASC 470-50,
 Debt – Modifications and Extinguishments
 (“ASC 470-50”). The Company recorded a $
69.8
 million gain on early extinguishment of debt during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, which included the write-off of previously deferred debt issuance costs of $
6.3
 million, which was included within Net gain on debt refinancing on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.  
The effective interest rate upon issuance of the 2026 Notes was 
0.45
%, which is the effective interest rate as of June 30, 2025.

Termination of Capped Call Transactions
In connection with the offering of the 2026 Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain counterparties (the “Capped Call Transactions”). In the last quarter of its fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, the Company terminated the Capped Call Transactions in their entirety pursuant to negotiated termination agreements with each such counterparty.
Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
On May 30, 2024, the Company entered into a Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the “Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and certain banks and financial institutions party thereto as lenders and issuing banks.
The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for a $
1.0
 billion term loan facility (the “Term Loan”), which will be due and payable on May 30, 2029. The Term Loan amortizes in quarterly installments of 
0.25
%, payable at the end of each fiscal quarter and on the maturity date.
The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also provides for a $
100.0
 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”), which will mature on May 30, 2029. The Company is only required to meet the total liquidity covenant, set at $
250.0
 million for the last business day of any week, and the subscription revenues covenant, set at $
1.2
 billion for the four-quarter trailing period, to the extent any revolving loans are borrowed and outstanding. 
The Revolving Facility, when drawn, bears interest at a rate equal to, at the Company’s option, either the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus 
4.00
% per annum or the Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus 
5.00
% per annum. The Company is required to pay an annual commitment fee of 
0.500
% or 
0.375
% per annum, depending on whether the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) is greater or less than 
5.00
 to 1.00, on a quarterly basis based on the unused portion of the Revolving Facility. 
The Term Loan initially bears interest at a rate equal to, at the Company’s option, either the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus 
5.00
% per annum or the Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) plus 
6.00
% per annum. The applicable rate for Alternate Base Rate loans or Term SOFR Rate loans is subject to a 
0.50
% step down, 
89
depending on whether the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio is less than 
5.00
 to 1.00 as measured on a quarterly basis. Any borrowing at the Alternate Base Rate is subject to a 
1.00
% floor and the Term SOFR Rate is subject to a 
0.00
% floor. 
The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants as well as customary negative covenants that restrict the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens or grant negative pledges, make loans and investments, conduct certain transactions with affiliates, sell certain assets, enter into certain swap agreements, guarantee obligations of third parties, declare dividends or make certain distributions, and undergo a merger or consolidation or certain other transactions. The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains certain customary events of default. Certain baskets and covenant levels have been adjusted and will apply equally to both the Term Loan and Revolving Facility for so long as the Term Loan is outstanding.
The obligations under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with respect to the Term Loan and the Revolving Facility are secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets, with certain exceptions set forth in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and are required to be guaranteed by certain material subsidiaries of the Company if, at the end of future financial quarters, certain conditions are not met.
During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, the Company incurred total commitment fees of $
0.5
 million, $
1.3
 million, and $
1.6
 million, respectively, which are included in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
As of June 30, 2025, the Company had drawn the full amount of the Term Loan and had 
not
 drawn on the Revolving Facility, and the Company had $
990.0
 million total outstanding borrowings under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.
In connection with the execution of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Term Loan was accounted for as a modification, extinguishment, or new loan for certain lenders in accordance with ASC 470-50. Accordingly, incremental discount and debt issuance costs of $
10.0
 million and $
2.3
 million, respectively, will be amortized to Interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Furthermore, the Company expensed $
8.7
 million of debt issuance costs incurred with third parties related to loss on debt modification and recognized a $
7.5
 million loss on extinguishment related to previously deferred debt discount and debt issuance costs, which was included within Net gain on debt refinancing on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.
As of June 30, 2025, the Company had not drawn any amount under the Revolving Facility and as such did not have to test the financial covenants under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Company is required to pledge or otherwise restrict a portion of cash and cash equivalents as collateral for standby letters of credit.  As of June 30, 2025, the Company had outstanding letters of credit totaling $
46.2
 million, which are classified as Restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Upon entering into the Term Loan, the effective interest rate was 
12.4
% and the current effective interest rate as of June 30, 2025 is 
10.9
%.

Bike Seat Post Recall
On May 11, 2023, in collaboration with the CPSC, the Company announced a voluntary recall of the original Peloton Bike (not Bike+) sold in the U.S. from January 2018 to May 2023 related to its seat post, and the Company is offering Members a free replacement seat post as the approved repair. As a result of this recall, the Company recognized 
zero
,

$(
5.5
) million, and $
48.4
 million
 for the (benefits) costs to replace the bike seat posts based on an amount that was deemed probable and reasonably estimable, reflected in Connected Fitness Products Cost of revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, 
2024, and 2023. As o
f June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024
, 
accruals of $
0.7
 million and 
$
1.2
 million, respectively,
 were 
included within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets related to the recall. The estimated cost to replace the bike seat posts is primarily based on the estimated number of requests for seat posts and the estimated costs of the production and shipment of the replacement parts.
 For more detail on the potential impacts of the recall to the Company’s business, see 
“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Connected Fitness Products and Members—Our products and services may be affected from time to time by design and manufacturing defects or product safety issues, real or perceived, that could adversely affect our business and result in harm to our reputation.”
Commitments to Suppliers
The Company utilizes contract manufacturers to build its products and accessories. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build products based on demand forecast information the Company supplies, which typically covers a rolling 12-month period. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires inventories from such manufacturers through purchase orders against which orders are applied based on projected demand information and availability of goods. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company’s forecasted product and manufacturing requirements for periods that range a number of months. In certain instances, these agreements allow the Company the option to cancel, reschedule, and/or adjust its requirements based on its business needs for a period of time before the order is due to be fulfilled. While the Company’s purchase orders are legally cancellable in many situations, there are some which are not cancellable in the event of a demand plan change or other circumstances, such as where the supplier has procured unique, Peloton-specific designs, and/or specific non-cancellable, non-returnable components based on the Company’s provided forecasts.
91
Legal and Regulatory Proceedings
The Company is, or may become, a party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of its business, including the matters set forth below. The Company denies the allegations in the active matters described below and intends to vigorously defend against such matters.
Some of the Company’s legal and regulatory proceedings, including matters and litigation that center around intellectual property claims, may be based on complex claims involving substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except for proceedings that have settled or been terminated, or except where otherwise indicated below, it is not possible to determine the probability of loss or estimate damages for such matters, and therefore, the Company has not established reserves for any of these proceedings. When the Company determines that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company records a liability, and, if the liability is material, discloses the amount of the liability reserved.
Unless otherwise disclosed below, while it is reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred, the Company is unable to estimate a range of potential loss due to the complexity and current status of these lawsuits. In these matters, the Company has not established a reserve.
The Company evaluates, on a regular basis, developments in its legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and makes adjustments and changes to the Company’s accruals and disclosures, as appropriate. For the matters the Company discloses that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial.
Given that the Company’s legal and regulatory proceedings are subject to uncertainty, there can be no assurance that such legal and regulatory proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
In May 2021, the Company initiated a voluntary recall of its Tread+ product in collaboration with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”). In December 2022, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with the CPSC regarding matters related to the Tread+ recall. In the settlement, the Company agreed to pay a $
19.1
 million civil penalty, resolving the CPSC’s charges that the Company violated the Consumer Product Safety Act (the “CPSA”). On May 18, 2023, the Company and the CPSC jointly announced the approval of a rear guard repair for the recalled Tread+. In 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security subpoenaed the Company for documents and other information related to the Company’s statutory obligations, including under the CPSA.
On October 26, 2021 and January 24, 2022, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York consolidated four stockholder derivative actions purportedly brought on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company’s officers and directors under the caption In re Peloton Interactive, Inc. Derivative Litigation, Master File No. 21-cv-02862-CBA-PK (the “EDNY Derivative Action”), which alleged, among other claims, breaches of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste, and violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act related to the Peloton Tread+ and the safety of the product. Alan Chu, Moshe Genack, Xingqi Liu and Anthony Franchi were appointed as co-lead plaintiffs. On December 14, 2022, two putative verified stockholder derivative actions in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, purportedly brought on behalf of the Company against certain of the Company’s officers and directors asserting similar allegations to those made in the EDNY Derivative Action, were consolidated as In re Peloton Interactive, Inc. Stockholder Derivative Litigation, Consol. Case No. 2022-1051-KSJM (the “Chancery Derivative Action”). On December 22, 2022, a stockholder filed a related putative stockholder derivative action in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting similar allegations to those in the EDNY Derivative Action and the Chancery Derivative Action against certain of the Company’s officers and directors, captioned Blackburn v. Foley, et al., Case No. 22-cv-01618-GBW (the “Blackburn Action”). The EDNY Derivative Action, the Chancery Derivative Action, and the Blackburn Action were all stayed pending the resolution of a related securities class action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the “EDNY Class Action”). The court entered a final judgment in the EDNY Class Action on July 9, 2024. The parties in the EDNY Derivative Action, the Chancery Derivative Action, and the Blackburn Action agreed to a settlement-in-principle to resolve those derivative actions on July 29, 2024, and plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of that settlement in the EDNY Derivative Action on November 15, 2024, which was granted on April 7, 2025.

Equity-Based Compensation 
2019 Equity Incentive Plan
In August 2019, the Board of Directors adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”), which serves as the successor the 2015 Stock Plan. The 2019 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants.

The fair value of the common stock is the closing stock price of Class A common stock as reported on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. The aggregate intrinsic value of exercised options was $
9.2
 million, $
12.7
 million, and $
85.1
 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

As of June 30, 2025, the Company had $
292.3
 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested stock-based awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 
2.0
 years.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, 
five
 employees who were eligible to participate in the Company’s Severance and Change in Control Plan (the “Severance Plan”) terminated employment. Certain modifications were made to equity awards, including the extension of the post-termination period during which the employee could exercise outstanding stock options from 
90
 days to 
one year
 (or the option expiration date, if earlier). In two instances during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, the employee transitioned to a non-executive advisory role. As a result of these modifications, the Company recognized incremental stock-based compensation expense of $
4.2
 million within General and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, certain modifications were made to equity awards for 
four

employees, who were eligible to participate in the Severance Plan, excluding the impact separately disclosed below, of the Company’s former President and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) who was also covered under the Severance Plan. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, this included the extension of the post-termination period during which an employee may exercise outstanding stock options from 
90
 days to 
one year
 (or the option expiration date, if earlier). In one instance during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the post-termination period during which an employee may exercise outstanding stock options was extended from 
90
 days to the earlier of the original expiration date or 
3
 years. This employee transitioned to a non-executive advisory role. As a result of these modifications, the Company recognized incremental stock-based compensation expense of $
5.6
 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 within Restructuring expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
On February 7, 2022, the Board of Directors granted the Company’s former President and CEO, 
8,000,000
 shares of the Class A common stock (the "Option Award"). The Option Award had an exercise price of $
38.77
 per share, equal to the closing price of the Class A common stock on the CEO Commencement Date of February 9, 2022. The awards were to vest and become exercisable over 
four years
, with 1/48th vesting on each monthly anniversary of the CEO Commencement Date, subject to the provision of the CEO’s continued service to the Company through each vesting date. The awards were to be exercisable through February 8, 2032. On May 2, 2024, Mr. McCarthy transitioned to a non-executive, strategic advisory role and was granted a new option award (the "Advisory Award") that vested in equal monthly installments through December 31, 2024. Mr. McCarthy also received 
one year
 of accelerated vesting on all outstanding stock options (other than the Advisory Award), which will remain exercisable until December 31, 2027. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, in connection with the CEO transition, the Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $
41.9
 million for the one year of accelerated vesting of the Option Award, which had an exercise price of $
38.77
 per share and a grant date fair value of approximately $
167.6
 million. In addition, the Company recognized incremental stock-based compensation expense of $
5.4
 million for the modification of stock option awards related to the extension of the exercise window through December 31, 2027. These expenses were recognized within General and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, 
13
 employees of the Company who were eligible to participate in the Severance Plan terminated employment. Certain modifications were made to equity awards, including, in certain instances, the post-termination period during which an employee may exercise outstanding stock options was extended from 
90
 days to 
one year
 (or the option expiration date, if earlier), and extended 
95
vesting was tied to certain consulting services that were deemed to be non-substantive. In one instance, the post-termination period during which an employee may exercise outstanding stock options was extended from 
90
 days to approximately 
2.8
 years. As a result of these modifications, the Company recognized incremental stock-based compensation expense of $
49.6
 million within Restructuring expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.
On July 1, 2022, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company approved a one-time repricing of certain stock option awards that had been granted to date under the 2019 Plan. The repricing impacted stock options held by all employees who remained employed through July 25, 2022. The repricing did not apply to the Company’s U.S.-based hourly employees (or employees with equivalent roles in non-U.S. locations) or its C-level executives. The original exercise prices of the repriced stock options ranged from $
12.94
 to $
146.79
 per share for the 
2,138
 total grantees. Each stock option was repriced to have a per share exercise price of $
9.13
, which was the closing price of Class A common stock on July 1, 2022. There were no changes to the number of shares, the vesting schedule or the expiration date of the repriced stock options. Incremental stock-based compensation expense resulting from the repricing was $
21.9
 million in the aggregate.
14. 
Concentration of Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. The Company’s cash and cash equivalents are maintained with high-quality financial institutions, the compositions and maturities of which are regularly monitored by management.
For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, there were no customers representing greater than 10% of the Company’s Total revenue.
The Company procures components from a broad group of suppliers. Some of the Company’s products require one or more components that are available from only a single source. In the event of an interruption from any of these suppliers, the Company may not be able to increase capacity from other sources or develop alternate or secondary sources without incurring material additional costs and delays. Accordingly, a loss of or poor performance by any of the Company’s significant suppliers could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and operating results.

The primary differences from the U.S. statutory rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 are due to the change in valuation allowance, stock-based compensation, permanent differences relating to excess officer compensation, and federal credits. The primary differences from the U.S. statutory rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 were due to the change in valuation allowance, stock-based compensation, and state and international taxes. The primary differences from the U.S. statutory rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 were due to the change in valuation allowance, stock-based compensation including excess tax benefits, and state and international taxes.
On July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was signed into law in the United States, which made permanent or extended many of the provisions from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The immediate expensing of domestic research and experimental expenditures for tax years beginning after December 31, 2024 is now permanent, as is 100% bonus depreciation for qualified property acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025. The bill permanently reinstates the more favorable EBITDA approach for calculating the business interest deduction limitation under Section 163(j). There are also changes to the effective rates and calculations on GILTI, FDII, and BEAT, among other provisions.  The Company is currently assessing the provisions of the law but does not currently believe it will have material adverse impacts for the business moving forward.
On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in the United States. Among other provisions, the Inflation Reduction Act includes a 15% minimum tax rate applied to corporations with profits in excess of $1 billion and also includes an excise tax on the repurchase of corporate stock. The Company has reviewed the provisions of the law and does not believe that any of the provisions will have a material impact on the business.
On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan was enacted, which extends the period companies can claim an Employee Retention Credit, expands the IRC Section 162(m) limit on deductions for publicly traded companies, and repeals the election that allows US affiliate groups to allocate interest expense on a worldwide basis, among other provisions. The Company reviewed the provisions of the law and determined it had no material impact for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.
As of June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, the Company’s deferred tax assets were primarily the result of U.S. federal and state net operating losses (“NOLs”), Section 174 capitalized expenditures, lease liability, non-qualified stock options, and research and development tax credits. A valuation allowance was maintained and/or established in substantially all jurisdictions on the Company’s gross deferred tax asset balances as of June 30, 2025 and 2024. As of each reporting date, the Company’s management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact management’s view with regard to future realization of deferred tax assets. The realization of deferred tax assets was based on the evaluation of current and estimated future profitability of the operations, reversal of deferred tax liabilities and the likelihood of utilizing tax credit and/or loss carryforwards. As of June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, the Company continued to maintain that it is not at the more likely than not standard, wherein deferred taxes will be realized due to the recent history of losses and management’s expectation of continued tax losses.

As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company had federal NOLs of approximately $
3,290.0
 million and $
3,313.8
 million, respectively, of which $
64.8
 million will begin to expire in 2034 and the remainder will be carried forward indefinitely. The Company has undergone three ownership changes in the past which have historically subjected its NOLs to a Section 382 limitation. The resulting Section 382 limitations are large enough to avail the Section 382 limited NOLs by June 30, 2022, therefore no NOLs are currently limited. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company had state NOLs of approximately $
2,657.9
 million and $
2,590.8
 million, respectively, which began to expire at various dates beginning in 2024. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company had foreign NOLs of approximately $

 million, respectively, generated primarily from its operations in the United Kingdom, which will be carried forward indefinitely. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company had $
79.4
 million and $
74.6
 million, respectively, of federal U.S. research and development credit carryovers that will begin to expire in 2036.
As of June 30, 2025, the Company did not have material undistributed foreign earnings. The Company has not recorded a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding or other foreign local tax on the undistributed earnings from the Company’s international subsidiaries as such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.

At both June 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company had 
no
 unrecognized tax benefits included as a component of income taxes payable within accrued expenses within the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
The Company has the following activity relating to unrecognized tax benefits:

Although it is possible that unrecognized tax benefits may increase or decrease within the next twelve months due to tax examination changes, settlement activities, expirations of statute of limitations, or the impact on recognition and measurement considerations related to the results of published tax cases or other similar activities, the Company does not anticipate any significant changes to unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months.
The Company is subject to taxation in the United States, various state and local jurisdictions, as well as foreign jurisdictions where the Company conducts business. Accordingly, on a continuing basis, the Company cooperates with taxing authorities for the various jurisdictions in which it conducts business to comply with audits and inquiries for tax periods that are open to examination. The tax years ended June 30, 2021 and later remain open to examination by tax authorities in the United States and United Kingdom.

Segment Information
The Company applies ASC 280, 
Segment Reporting
, in determining reportable segments. The Company has 
two
 reportable segments: Connected Fitness Products and Subscription. Segment information is presented in the same manner that the chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), the Chief Executive Officer and President, reviews the operating results in assessing performance and allocating resources. The CODM reviews consolidated revenue and gross profit for both of the reportable segments, primarily by monitoring actual results compared to forecasted results as well as by reviewing year-over-year results and trending historical performance. Gross profit, which is the Company’s measure of segment 
99
profit or loss, is defined as Revenue less Cost of revenue incurred by the segment. No other significant expense categories or performance metrics are regularly provided to the CODM on a disaggregated basis.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the reportable segments. The Company does not allocate assets at the reportable segment level as these are managed on an entity wide group basis and, accordingly, the Company does not report asset information by segment. 
The Connected Fitness Products segment primarily derives revenue from sale of the Company's portfolio of Connected Fitness Products and related accessories, as well as Precor-branded fitness products, delivery and installation services, Peloton Bike portfolio rental products, extended warranty agreements, branded apparel, and commercial service contracts. The Subscription segment primarily derives revenue from monthly Subscription fees. There are no internal revenue transactions between the Company’s segments.
Key financial performance measures of the segments including Revenue, Cost of revenue, and Gross profit are as follows:

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2025. 
Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for Peloton. With the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025 based on the guidelines established in the Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2025.
Remediation of Material Weaknesses
As reported in Part II, Item 9A. “Controls and Procedures” of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024, June 30, 2023, June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, we previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to controls around the existence, completeness, and valuation of inventory. 
Management has completed the implementation of significant enhancements to our inventory management process related to the existence, completeness, and valuation of inventory. Management has implemented new or enhanced internal control procedures which we believe address both the identified material weakness and strengthens our overall financial control environment, including:
•
Increased frequency of the periodic physical inventory count process at our distribution centers and final mile and locations; 
•
Increased accuracy of periodic inventory count at all third-party logistics service providers through increased communication, oversight of their inventory management policies and procedures, and higher partner accountability when dealing with errors;
•
Designed and implemented management oversight controls specifically related to inventory counts at third party distribution centers and final mile locations;
•
Increased operational accuracy of inventory cycle count processes;
•
Improved timeliness and accuracy of transactional processing between Peloton and third-party service providers and increased the accuracy of inventory data across Peloton internal systems, Peloton warehouses, and third-party providers;
•
Implemented or enhanced controls related to inventory costing and the review of inventory excess and obsolescence reserves;
•
Consolidated our inventory network and reduced our inventory exposure to locations with historically high physical count inaccuracy; and
•
Enhanced our training of standard operating procedures and internal controls to key stakeholders within the supply chain, logistics, and inventory processes.
These steps have been subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as oversight by the audit committee of our Board of Directors. 
Based on the results of our testing of the enhanced controls, we have determined that the updated controls and procedures are effective as of June 30, 2025.  As a result, we believe this material weakness has been remediated. 
In addition, as previously reported in Part II, Item 9A. “Controls and Procedures” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the business process control environment at Precor. Management assessed the design and operating effectiveness of automated and manual business process controls in Precor’s environment, and identified a number of deficiencies related to lack of proper design of controls and lack of sufficient documentation to validate control design effectiveness, in particular management review controls. Management determined that in the aggregate, these control deficiencies constitute a material weakness.

Management has completed the implementation of significant enhancements to our Precor’s business process controls. Management has implemented new or enhanced internal control procedures which we believe address both the identified material weakness and strengthens our overall financial control environment, including:
•
Utilized a risk-based approach to remediation and prioritized business process controls designed to mitigate significant financial statement risk areas, including financial statement close process review controls and management review controls over inventory and revenue transactions; 
•
Engaged an accounting advisory firm to assist with the documentation, evaluation, remediation, and testing of our internal control over financial reporting related to Precor’s business process control environment based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission;
101
•
Trained relevant personnel on the design and operation of our internal control over financial reporting relating to Precor’s business process control environment; and
•
Hired additional qualified accounting and financial reporting personnel with internal control expertise to suppo
rt the Precor business.
These steps have been subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as oversight by the audit committee of our Board of Directors. 
Based on the results of our testing of the enhanced controls, we have determined that the updated controls and procedures are effective as of June 30, 2025.  As a result, we believe this material weakness has been remediated. 
We concluded with respect to each of the material weaknesses described above that these material weaknesses did not result in any material misstatements in our financial state
ments or disclosures 
in the current year or in our annual consolidated financial statements in any of the prior fiscal years in which this material weakness existed. Based on additional procedures and post-closing review, management concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual
 Report on Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Other than the remediation efforts described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues within a company are detected. The inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements, has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
