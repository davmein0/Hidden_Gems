Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.
You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, performance, or achievements. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as required by law.
You should read this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the documents that we reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and have filed with the SEC, with the understanding that our actual future results, performance, and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect.
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the words “we,” “us,” “our,” and "Peloton" refer to Peloton Interactive, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise.

RISK FACTOR SUMMARY
Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should carefully consider these risks and uncertainties when investing in our Class A common stock. Some of the principal risks and uncertainties include the following:
•
We have incurred operating losses in the past, may incur operating losses in the future, and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.
•
We may be unable to attract and retain Subscribers, which could have an adverse effect on our business and rate of growth.
•
Our operating results have been, and could in the future be, adversely affected if we are unable to accurately forecast consumer demand for our products and services and adequately manage our inventory.
•
We may not successfully execute or achieve the expected benefits of our restructuring initiatives and other cost-saving measures we may take in the future, and our efforts may result in further actions and/or additional asset impairment charges and adversely affect our business.
•
The Company has evolved rapidly in recent years and continues to establish its operating experience at the appropriate scale. If we are unable to manage our longer-term growth, intervening changes and costs, or implement restructuring initiatives effectively, our brand, company culture, and financial performance may suffer
.
•
If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully develop and offer new, innovative, and updated products and services in a timely manner, or effectively manage the introduction of new or enhanced products and services, our business may be adversely affected.
•
The connected fitness market is relatively new and, if the general market and specific demand for our products and services does not resume growth, or fails to grow as much as we expect, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected.
•
Our past financial results may not be indicative of our future performance.
•
Our success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of the Peloton brand.
•
Changes in trade policies in the U.S. and internationally, including the imposition of tariffs, have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
Any major disruption or failure of our information technology systems or websites, or those of third-parties on whom we rely, or our failure to successfully implement upgrades and new technology effectively, could adversely affect our business and operations. 
•
Our growing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies may present additional risks and challenges, which could result in reputational and competitive harm, legal liability and adversely affect our results of operations.
•
We rely on a limited number of suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics partners for our Connected Fitness Products. We also partner with and rely on third-party billing and e-commerce systems. A loss of any of these partners or an interruption or inability of these partners to satisfy our demand needs could negatively affect our business.
•
We have limited control over our suppliers, contract manufacturers, and logistics partners, which may subject us to significant risks, including the potential inability to produce or obtain quality products and services on a timely basis or in sufficient 
quantity.
•
We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our Connected Fitness Products. A further decline in sales of our Connected Fitness Products would negatively affect our future revenue and operating results.
•
We operate in a highly competitive market, and we may be unable to compete successfully against existing and future competitors.
•
We depend upon third-party licenses for the use of music in our content. An adverse change to, loss of, or claim that we do not hold necessary licenses may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
•
From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings, government inquiries or investigations, product recalls or similar programs, or disputes that could cause us to incur significant expenses, divert our management’s attention, and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
