Our net income during 2024 compared to 2023 primarily reflects the effects of the following factors:

Electric Utility

An increase in electric investments, as part of the 2024 rate case, contributed to earnings for 2024. Unfavorable weather contributed to lower electric residential sales during 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year.

Gas Utility

Lower gas retail sales resulting from warmer than normal weather in the first quarter of 2024 contributed to lower gas earnings in 2024. Gas retail sales decreased approximately 4% and heating degree days (a measure for determining the impact of weather during the heating season) decreased by approximately 6% in 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year.

Nonregulated Energy

An increase in electric generation lease revenue from the Elm Road Units and WCCF assets contributed to earnings during 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year.

Transmission Investments

In 2024, our share of ATC's earnings reflected an increase in net income for the reduction of estimated possible loss of approximately $0.8 million inclusive of interest and net of tax, related to the October 2024 developments in the MISO transmission owners complaints on authorized return on equity. See additional information in "
Other Matters
" below.

All Other

The decrease in net loss for all other operations during 2024 compared to 2023, is primarily related to a $1.5 million (pre-tax) voluntary contribution to the Madison Gas and Electric Foundation in 2023.

Significant Events

The following events affected our results of operations in 2024:

2024/2025 Rate Proceeding: In December 2023, the PSCW approved a 1.54% increase to electric rates and 2.44% increase to gas rates for 2024. The PSCW also approved a 4.17% increase to electric rates and 1.32% increase to gas rates in 2025. The PSCW approved a 2025 Fuel Cost Plan in December 2024. The plan lowered the 2025 increase in electric rates to 2.63%, reflecting lower expected fuel costs. See "
Other Matters
" below for additional information on the 2024/2025 rate proceeding.

The 2024/2025 rate order includes an earnings sharing mechanism, under which, if MGE earns above the 9.7% ROE authorized in the rate order: (i) MGE will retain 100% of earnings for the first 15 basis points above the authorized ROE; (ii) 50% of the next 60 basis points will be required to be deferred and returned to customers; and (iii) 100% of any remaining excess earnings will be required to be refunded to customers. The earnings calculation excludes fuel rules adjustments.

Estimated costs are expected to exceed PSCW previously approved CA levels. Notifications are provided to the PSCW when costs increase above CA levels. MGE has requested, and will continue to request, recovery of the updated estimated costs in its rate case proceedings.

(e)
Pending approval by the PSCW.

West Riverside. In June 2024, MGE purchased an additional 25 MW of capacity of West Riverside for approximately $25 million. After purchase, MGE owns 50 MW of capacity of West Riverside. West Riverside is a natural gas-fired generating plant.

Deferred Fuel Costs - Subject to Refund: As of December 31, 2024, MGE had deferred $3.0 million of 2024 fuel savings. These costs will be subject to the PSCW's annual review of 2024 fuel costs, expected to be completed during 2025. See 
Footnote 9.b.
 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further information regarding fuel proceedings.

2023 Annual Fuel Proceeding: MGE had fuel savings in 2023. As of December 31, 2023, MGE had deferred $7.2 million of 2023 fuel costs. The PSCW has completed the annual review of 2023 fuel costs and approved MGE's return of these savings over a three-month period from October 2024 through December 2024. There was no change to the costs to be refunded as a result of the fuel rules proceedings from the amount MGE deferred in 2023.

Equity Issuance Plans: In September 2024, MGE Energy began issuing new shares of common stock to participants in our Direct Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan.

ATC Return on Equity: As discussed in "
Other Matters
" below, ATC's authorized ROE, which is used in calculating its rates and revenues, was the subject of a challenge before FERC. A decrease in ATC's ROE could result in lower equity earnings and distributions from ATC in the future. MGE Energy derived approximately 7.4% and 6.4% of net income for 2024 and 2023, respectively, from the investment in ATC.

During 2025, several items may affect our financial condition and results of operations, including:

Environmental Initiatives: There are proposed legislative rules and initiatives involving matters related to air emissions, water effluent, hazardous materials, and greenhouse gases, all of which affect generation plant capital expenditures and operating costs as well as future operational planning. Legislation and rulemaking addressing climate change and related matters could significantly affect the costs of owning and operating fossil-fueled generating plants. MGE would expect to seek and receive recovery of any such

31

costs in rates. However, it is difficult to estimate the amount of such costs due to the uncertainty as to the timing and form of any legislation or rules, the timing and effects of any judicial review, and the scope and time of the recovery of costs in rates, which may occur after those costs have been incurred and paid.

Future Generation - 80% carbon reduction target by 2030 (from 2005 levels): MGE has outlined initiatives to achieve our target.

•
Transitioning away from coal. 
Columbia: MGE, along with the other plant co-owners, announced plans to retire Columbia Unit 1 and Unit 2 by the end of 2029. Final timing and retirement dates for Units 1 and 2 are subject to change depending on operational, regulatory, capacity needs, and other factors impacting one or more of the Columbia co-owners. MGE has a plan, which it continues to evaluate, to replace the generation from Columbia while maintaining electric service reliability. In December 2024, MGE and Columbia's co-owners announced plans to explore converting at least one unit of Columbia to natural gas before the end of 2029.

Elm Road Units: MGE, along with the plant co-owner, announced plans to end the use of coal as a primary fuel at the Elm Road Units and transition the plant to natural gas. Transition plans and costs will be subject to PSCW approval. MGE's remaining use of coal is expected to be further reduced as the Elm Road Units transition to natural gas. By the end of 2030, coal is expected to be used only as a backup fuel at the Elm Road Units. This transition will help MGE meet its 2030 carbon reduction goals. By the end of 2032, MGE expects that the Elm Road Units will be fully transitioned away from coal, which will eliminate coal as an internal generation source for MGE.

•
Growing renewable generation. 
MGE is seeking to acquire a joint interest in several renewable generation projects. See our 2025-2029 capital expenditures forecast included under "
Liquidity and Capital Resources
" below for information on these projects.

Environmental Initiatives – Natural gas distribution: Building upon our long-standing commitment to providing affordable, sustainable energy, MGE has set a goal to achieve net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas distribution system by 2035. If MGE can accelerate plans to achieve net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas system—through the evolution of new technologies, such as renewable natural gas—it will. MGE is working to reduce overall emissions from its natural gas distribution system in a quick and cost-effective manner. For customers who want to reduce their environmental footprint further, MGE introduced a renewable natural gas program in May 2024, after approval by the PSCW. MGE purchases renewable thermal credits on behalf of customers who voluntarily elect in the program to offset the emissions associated with the customer's monthly natural gas usage.

Solar Procurement Disruptions: MGE is monitoring import regulations under the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act and the U.S. Department of Commerce new solar tariffs. These disruptions have a potential to impact current and future solar projects which may result in an increase in costs or delays in construction timelines. In the event that such disruptions cause costs to exceed the levels approved for specific projects, we have filed, and expect to continue to file, notifications with the PSCW and expect to request recovery of any increases in MGE's future rate proceedings. See "
Other Matters
" below for additional information on the solar procurement disruptions.

Executive Order – Tariffs: MGE is monitoring the actions of the Trump Administration with respect to certain proposed import tariffs on foreign goods, including those from Canada, Mexico, and/or China. These tariffs have a potential impact on cost of operations and on current and future capital projects. See "
Other Matters
" below for additional information on the executive orders on Tariffs.

•
Rate changes. 
In December 2023, the PSCW authorized MGE to increase 2024 rates for retail electric customers by approximately 1.54%. Rates charged to retail customers during 2024 were $6.5 million higher than those charged during 2023. See 
Footnote 9
 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further information on the rate increase. Any increase in rates associated with fuel or purchase power costs are generally offset in fuel and purchased power costs and do not have a significant impact on net income.

•
Customer fixed and demand charges. 
During 2024, fixed and demand charges increased $2.6 million primarily attributable to the increase in demand charges for commercial customers.

•
Sales to the market. 
Sales to the market typically occur when MGE has more generation and purchases in the MISO market than are needed for its customer demand. The excess electricity is then sold to other utilities or power marketers in the MISO market. During 2024, market volumes increased compared to 2023, reflecting increase in sales. However, the cost of capacity sold decreased offsetting the revenue generated from increased sales to the market from excess generation and purchases. The revenue generated from these sales is included in fuel rules costs. See fuel rules discussion in 
Footnote 9
 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report.

•
Volume. 
During 2024, residential sales decreased by approximately 1% compared to 2023. The decrease was driven by unfavorable weather.

•
Revenue subject to refund. 
For cost recovery mechanisms, any over-collection of revenues resulting from costs authorized to be collected from customers in rates exceeding actual costs is recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period incurred, as the over-collection is expected to be refunded to customers in a subsequent period. In the year the over-collection is refunded, rates are reduced and offset as revenue subject to refund. There is no net income impact in the year the costs are refunded.

The $3.6 million decrease in fuel for electric generation was due to an approximately 17% decrease in the average cost, partially offset by an approximately 13% increase in internal generation. Renewable generation increased approximately 26% driven by new generation sources including Badger Hollow II.

Excluding deferred fuel costs, purchased power decreased $9.7 million. The decrease in purchased power was due to an approximately 30% decrease in market purchases as a result of increased internal generation. Furthermore, there was an approximately 4% increase in average cost partially offsetting the decrease in market purchases. Deferred fuel cost recovered in 2024 is $6.7 million compared to $5.4 million in 2023.

Fuel and purchased power costs are generally offset by electric revenue and do not have a significant impact on net income. MGE expects to seek and receive recovery of fuel and purchased power costs outside the fuel rules bandwidth in customer rates. See 
Footnote 9
 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further information on the fuel rules bandwidth.


Rate changes. 
In December 2023, the PSCW authorized MGE to increase 2024 rates for retail gas customers by 2.44%. 

MGE recovers the cost of natural gas in its gas segment through the purchased gas adjustment clause (PGA). Under the PGA, MGE is able to pass through to its gas customers the cost of gas. Changes in PGA recoveries affect revenues but do not change net income in view of the pass-through treatment of the costs. Payments for natural gas decreased driving lower rates during 2024.

The average retail rate per therm excluding customer fixed charges for 2024, decreased approximately 7% compared to 2023, reflecting a decrease in natural gas commodity costs (recovered through the PGA).

•
Volume. 
For 2024, retail gas deliveries decreased approximately 4% compared to 2023 primarily attributable to unfavorable weather conditions in the first half of 2024.

34

•
Other.
 Other gas revenues decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily related to lower residential customer fixed charges. The PSCW approved a reduction in the customer fixed charge component of the residential gas rate in the 2024 rate proceeding.

Cost of gas sold

Cost of gas sold decreased $24.0 million in 2024 compared to 2023. Cost per therm decreased approximately 19% and therms delivered decreased approximately 4%. MGE recovers the cost of natural gas in its gas segment through the PGA as described under "Gas deliveries and revenues" above.

•
Increased customer accounts costs are primarily related to collection of deferred bad debt expense from prior years. MGE has received approval to recover deferred bad debt expense from 2020 through 2023 over a two-year period beginning in 2024. Bad debt expense is generally offset by electric revenue and does not have a significant impact on net income.

•
Increased transmission costs are primarily a result of an increase in transmission rate and collection of deferred costs from prior years. Transmission costs represent ATC and MISO network transmission expenses authorized to collect in rates. The PSCW has approved MGE to defer as a regulatory asset or liability, the difference between actual costs included in rates and to be recovered or refunded in a future rate proceeding. Transmission cost is generally offset by electric revenue and does not have a significant impact on net income.

•
Increased electric production expenses are primarily related to operating and maintenance costs for Columbia and renewable generating facilities. MGE continues to add new renewable generation sites including the second phase of Badger Hollow which went online in December 2023.

•
Increased electric distribution expenses in 2024 are primarily related to the May 2024 storm response costs.

•
Decreased administrative and general costs are primarily related to a decrease in pension and other postretirement service costs. These costs are generally offset by electric revenue and do not have a significant impact on net income.

Consolidated depreciation expense

Electric depreciation expense increased $6.8 million and gas depreciation expense increased $1.2 million for 2024, compared to 2023. MGE purchased West Riverside in March 2023 and Badger Hollow II was placed in service in December 2023. The timing of the in-service dates contributed to the increase in electric depreciation expense.

Electric and gas other income and interest expense

Electric other income decreased $9.8 million and gas other income decreased $5.7 million during 2024, compared to 2023, primarily related to pension and other postretirement other than service costs.

Electric interest expense increased $2.2 million and gas interest expense increased $0.8 million during 2024, compared to 2023, primarily related to new long-term debt issuances. See 
Footnote 14
 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for additional information on the new debt issuances.

Nonregulated Energy Operations - MGE Energy and MGE

The nonregulated energy operations are conducted through certain of MGE Energy's subsidiaries: MGE Power Elm Road (the Elm Road Units) and MGE Power West Campus (WCCF), which have been formed to own and lease electric generating capacity to assist MGE. For 2024 and 2023, net income at the nonregulated energy operations segment was $24.1 million and $22.4 million, respectively.

Transmission Investment Operations - MGE Energy

The transmission investment segment holds our interest in ATC and ATC Holdco, and its income reflects our equity in the earnings of those investments. ATC Holdco was formed in December 2016 to pursue transmission development opportunities that typically have long development and investment lead times before becoming operational. During 2024 and 2023, other income from the transmission investment segment primarily reflected ATC's operations and was $12.3 million and $10.6 million, respectively. In October 2024, FERC issued a ruling eliminating the risk premium in the ROE calculation resulting in a 4-basis point reduction in the base ROE from 10.02% to 9.98%. See 
Footnote 7
 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report and "
Other Matters
" below for additional information concerning ATC and summarized financial information regarding ATC.

All Other Operations - MGE Energy

Other income

The increase of $2.1 million in other income from all other operations during 2024 compared to 2023, is primarily related to a $1.5 million (pre-tax) voluntary contribution to the Madison Gas and Electric Foundation, MGE's philanthropic arm, in 2023.

Consolidated Income Taxes - MGE Energy and MGE

See 
Footnote 10
 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for the effective tax rate reconciliation.

Noncontrolling Interest, Net of Tax - MGE

Noncontrolling interest, net of tax, reflects the accounting required for MGE Energy's interest in MGE Power Elm Road (the Elm Road Units) and MGE Power West Campus (WCCF). MGE Energy owns 100% of MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus; however, due to the contractual agreements for these projects with MGE, the entities are considered VIEs with respect to MGE and their results are consolidated with those of MGE, the primary beneficiary of the VIEs.

Forecasted capital expenditures are based upon management's assumptions with respect to future events, including the timing and amount of expenditures associated with environmental compliance initiatives, legislative and regulatory action, supply chain and market disruptions, customer demand and support for electrification and renewable energy resources, energy conservation

37

programs, load growth, the timing of any required regulatory approvals, and the adequacy of rate recovery. Actual events may differ materially from these assumptions and result in material changes to those forecasted amounts.

MGE is targeting at least 80% carbon reduction from electric generation by 2030 (from 2005 levels) and net-zero carbon electricity by 2050. Solar, wind, and battery storage projects are a major step toward deep decarbonization and greater use of clean energy sources in pursuit of our goal. In addition, natural gas generation projects help enable MGE's clean energy transition and ensure reliability for customers as the energy supply is decarbonized. MGE continues to evaluate solar, wind, battery storage, and natural gas generation projects that align with its goals as legacy fossil fuel-fired facilities are retired.

MGE continues to assess the potential impact of procurement disruptions on current and future solar projects that may result in an increase in costs or delays in construction timelines. In the event that such disruptions cause costs to exceed the levels approved for specific projects, we have filed, and expect to continue to file, notifications with the PSCW and expect to request recovery of any increases in MGE's future rate proceedings. See further information on procurement disruptions discussed earlier under "
Executive Overview
."

Columbia Energy Storage Project: In August 2024, MGE was included in a Joint Application to develop an Energy Dome closed-loop gas-to-liquid solution. This project would use vaporized liquid carbon dioxide to power an electric generating turbine. The project was awarded with a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations. The grant will reduce the total estimated project expenses. MGE holds a 19% ownership interest in this project and the cost, after grant, is expected to be approximately $12 million. This project is pending approval from the PSCW.

Other local solar and battery storage projects: In 2025 through 2026, electric renewable capital expenditures include local investments in solar generation and battery storage. Forecasted total capital expenditures for those years is approximately $35 million.

West Riverside: In June 2024, MGE purchased an additional 25 MW of capacity of West Riverside for approximately $25 million. After purchase, MGE owns 50 MW of capacity of West Riverside. West Riverside is a natural gas-fired generating plant.

Electric and Gas Distribution: In 2025 through 2029, electric and gas capital expenditures include investment in enhanced metering solutions to provide customers with more timely and detailed energy use information. Investments in advanced metering infrastructure will provide additional benefits including outage and demand response and automated meter reading capabilities. Forecasted total capital expenditures for those years is approximately $52 million.

Financing Activities

The principal sources and uses of cash are related to short-term and long-term borrowings and repayments and the payment of cash dividends.

The principal increases (decreases) in cash flows from financing activities during 2024, compared to 2023, were as follows:

(a)
The noncontrolling interest arises from the accounting required for the entities, which are not owned by MGE but are consolidated as VIEs.

(b)
During 2024, MGE issued $50 million of senior unsecured notes that were used to assist with financing additional capital expenditures and other corporate obligations. During 2023, MGE issued $120 million of senior unsecured notes that were used to repay $30 million of maturing unsecured senior notes and to assist with financing additional capital expenditures and other corporate obligations. In addition, during 2023 $19.3 million of Industrial Development Revenue Bonds were tendered by their holders as required by the terms of the bonds and remarketed as permitted by those terms.

Dividend Restrictions

Dividend payments by MGE to MGE Energy are subject to restrictions arising under a PSCW rate order and, to a lesser degree, MGE's first mortgage bonds. The PSCW order restricts any dividends that MGE may pay MGE Energy if its common equity ratio, calculated in the manner used in the rate proceeding, is less than 55%. MGE's thirteen month rolling average common equity ratio as of December 31, 2024, is 57.6%, as determined under the calculation used in the rate proceeding. This restriction did not restrict MGE's payment of dividends in 2024. Cash dividends of $34.5 million and $41.0 million, respectively, were paid by MGE to MGE Energy in 2024 and 2023. The rate proceeding calculation includes indebtedness imputed amounts for MGE's outstanding purchase power capacity payments and other PSCW adjustments but does not include the indebtedness associated with MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus, which are consolidated into MGE's financial statements but are not direct obligations of MGE.

39

MGE has covenanted with the holders of its first mortgage bonds not to declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on or purchase any shares of its common stock unless, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of all such dividends and distributions and all amounts applied to such purchases, after December 31, 1945, shall not exceed the earned surplus (retained earnings) accumulated subsequent to December 31, 1945. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $754.6 million was available for the payment of dividends under this covenant.

MGE Power West Campus has covenanted with the holders of its outstanding senior secured notes not to declare or make distributions to us in the event that, both before and after giving effect to such distribution, its total debt to total capitalization would exceed 0.65 to 1.00 or its projected debt service coverage ratio for the following four fiscal quarters would be less than 1.25 to 1.00. Projected debt service coverage considers the projected revenues available for debt service, after deducting expenses other than debt service, in relation to projected debt service on indebtedness.

MGE Power Elm Road has covenanted with the holders of its outstanding senior secured notes not to declare or make distributions to us in the event that, both before and after giving effect to such distribution, its projected debt service coverage ratio for the following four fiscal quarters would be less than 1.25 to 1.00. Projected debt service coverage considers the projected revenues available for debt service, after deducting expenses other than debt service, in relation to projected debt service on indebtedness.

Borrowings under the Credit Agreements may bear interest at a rate based upon either a "floating rate" or an "Adjusted Term SOFR Rate," plus an adder based upon the credit ratings assigned to MGE's senior unsecured long-term debt securities. The "floating rate" is calculated on a daily basis as the highest of a prime rate and several adjusted interest rate indices (as set forth in the Credit Agreements), subject to a floor of one percent per annum or zero, depending on the credit agreement. The "floating rate" adder ranges from zero to 0.125%. The "Adjusted Term SOFR Rate" is calculated as provided in the Credit Agreements. The "Adjusted Term SOFR Rate" adder ranges from 0.625% to 1.125%.

The credit agreements require the borrower to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization not to exceed a maximum of 65%. In the case of MGE, the ratio calculation excludes assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses included in MGE's financial statements as a result of the consolidation of VIEs, such as MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus. As of December 31, 2024, the ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated total capitalization for each of MGE Energy and MGE, as calculated under the credit agreements' covenant, were 38.5% and 41.4%, respectively. See 
Footnote 13
 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for additional information regarding the credit facilities.

MGE Energy's and MGE's access to the capital markets, including, in the case of MGE, the commercial paper market, and their respective financing costs in those markets, may depend on the credit ratings of the entity that is accessing the capital markets.

40

None of MGE Energy's or MGE's borrowing is subject to default or prepayment as a result of a downgrading of credit ratings, although a downgrading of MGE's credit ratings would increase fees and interest charges under both MGE Energy's and MGE's credit agreements and may affect the collateral required to be posted under derivative transactions.

Construction obligations consist primarily of Paris, Darien, and other renewable projects.

(g)
Other obligations are primarily related to investment commitments, environmental projects, and uncertain tax positions.

The above amounts do not include any contributions for MGE's pension and postretirement plans. MGE does not expect to need to make any required contributions to the qualified plans for 2025. The contributions for years after 2025 are not yet currently estimated. Due to uncertainties in the future economic performance of plan assets, discount rates, and other key assumptions, estimated contributions are subject to change. MGE may also elect to make additional discretionary contributions to the plans.

The above amounts do not include future capital calls by ATC and ATC Holdco. In January 2025, MGE Transco made a $2.5 million contribution to ATC. The amount and timing of future capital calls to these entities is uncertain and primarily dependent on the operations and expansion of ATC and the development activities by ATC Holdco.

Rate Matters

In December 2023, the PSCW approved the 2024/2025 rate application for an increase of 1.54% for electric rates and a 2.44% increase for gas rates in 2024. The PSCW also approved a 4.17% increase for electric rates and a 1.32% increase to gas rates for 2025. The PSCW approved a 2025 Fuel Cost Plan in December 2024. The plan lowered the 2025 increase in electric rates to 2.63%.

(a)
Average rate base amounts reflect MGE's allocated share of rate base and do not include construction work in progress (CWIP) or a cash working capital allowance and were calculated using a forecasted 13-month average for the test periods. The PSCW provides a return on selected CWIP and a cash working capital allowance by adjusting the percentage return on rate base.

(b)
50% of the forecasted 13-month average CWIP for the test periods which earns an AFUDC return. Projects eligible to earn 100% AFUDC are excluded from this balance and discussed further in the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Significant Events section.

(c)
Authorized returns on common equity may not be indicative of actual returns earned or projections of future returns, as actual returns will be affected by the volume of electricity or gas sold.  

See 
Footnote 9.a.
 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further discussion of rate proceedings.

ATC

MISO transmission owners, including ATC, are involved in two complaints filed at FERC by several parties challenging that the base ROE in effect for MISO transmission owners, including ATC, was no longer just and reasonable. Each complaint provided for a 15-month statutory refund period: November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015 (the "First Complaint Period") and February 12, 2015 through May 11, 2016 (the "Second Complaint Period").

In May 2020, FERC issued an order further refining the methodology for setting authorized ROE. This refined methodology increased the authorized ROE from 9.88% to 10.02%. This base ROE is effective for the First Complaint Period and for all periods following September 2016. This order also dismissed the second complaint. Accordingly, no refunds were ordered for the Second Complaint Period.

Several petitions for review of FERC’s prior orders were filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (the "Court") and an oral argument was held in November 2021. In August 2022, the Court ruled that four of the five arguments made by the complaining parties were unpersuasive. However, the Court agreed that FERC’s decision to reintroduce a risk-premium model into its ROE methodology was arbitrary and capricious. The Court vacated the underlying orders for the First Complaint Period and remanded to FERC for further proceedings. In October 2024, FERC issued a ruling eliminating the risk premium in the ROE calculation resulting in a 4-basis point reduction in the base ROE from 10.02% to 9.98%. FERC also affirmed its prior decision to dismiss the second complaint. ATC must provide refunds, with interest, by December 2025 covering the First Complaint Period and all periods following September 2016. Prior to the ruling, MGE Energy's share of ATC’s earnings reflected a possible loss of approximately $1.2 million, inclusive of interest and net of tax, for a possible additional refund for the First Complaint Period and

42

for the period following the Second Complaint Period. As a result of the October 2024 ruling, during the fourth quarter 2024  earnings in ATC reflected an approximately $0.8 million reduction of the reserve.

We derived approximately 7.4% and 6.4% of our net income for 2024 and 2023, respectively from our investment in ATC.

Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act

In June 2021, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued a Withhold Release Order (WRO) against silica-based products made by Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd., a company located in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. As a result of this WRO, CBP is holding many solar panels imported into the United States until importers can prove that the panels do not contain materials originating from this region. The Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act (UFLPA), a federal law that became effective on June 21, 2022, further established that all goods mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in Xinjiang or by certain defined entities are prohibited from U.S. importation. Suppliers for MGE's current solar projects were able to provide the CBP sufficient documentation to meet WRO compliance requirements, and MGE expects the same will be true for UFLPA purposes, however we cannot currently predict what, if any, impact the UFLPA will have on the overall supply of solar panels into the United States and the related impact to timing and cost of solar projects included in MGE's capital plan. In the event that such disruptions cause costs to exceed the levels approved for specific projects, we have filed and expect to continue to file a notification with the PSCW and expect to request recovery of any cost increases in MGE's future rate proceedings.

U.S. Department of Commerce - Solar Cells and Modules

In August 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued its final determination on a solar tariff investigation that began in 2022, finding that Chinese manufacturers were circumventing tariffs on solar panels by shipping them through four Southeast Asian countries. A 24-month exemption from tariffs for solar panel and module imports from these four countries was in effect from June 2022 until June 6, 2024. In May 2024, the Biden Administration announced that bifacial solar panels would be subject to safeguard tariffs under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, from which they were previously excluded. President Biden also directed U.S. Trade Representatives to increase tariffs under Section 301 from 25% to 50% on solar cells and modules. MGE continues to assess the potential impact of these

tariffs on current and future solar projects which may result in an increase in costs or delays in construction timelines. In the event that such disruptions cause costs to exceed the levels approved for specific projects, we have filed and expect to continue to file a notification with the PSCW and expect to request recovery of any cost increases in MGE's future rate proceedings.

Executive Order on Tariffs

On February 1, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order implementing a 25% additional tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10% additional tariff on imports from China. Energy resources from Canada will have a lower 10% tariff. On February 3, 2025, the Canada and Mexico tariff was immediately paused for one month. MGE continues to assess the potential impact of these tariffs to MGE's cost of operations and on current and future capital expenditures including solar or battery storage projects. These tariffs may cause an increase in costs or delays in construction timelines.

Critical Accounting Estimates - MGE Energy and MGE

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, estimates are evaluated, including those related to regulatory assets and liabilities, unbilled revenues, pension obligations, and income taxes. Estimates are based on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Those values may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect the more significant judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.

Regulatory Assets/Liabilities

Regulatory assets represent costs that have been deferred to future periods when it is probable that the regulator will allow future recovery of those costs through rates. MGE bases its assessment of recovery on precedents established by the regulatory body. Regulatory liabilities represent previous collections from customers that are expected to be refunded to customers in future periods. Regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities typically include deferral of energy costs, the normalization of income taxes, pension and other postretirement costs, the deferral of certain operating expenses, and non-ARO removal costs. The accounting for these regulatory assets and liabilities is in accordance with regulatory accounting standards.

43

MGE continually assesses whether the regulatory assets and liabilities meet the criteria for probability of future recovery or deferral. This assessment considers factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, recent rate orders to other regulated entities under the same jurisdiction, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. If future recovery of costs becomes no longer probable, the assets and liabilities would be recognized as current-period revenues or expenses.

Amortization of regulatory assets and liabilities is provided over the recovery or deferral period as allowed in the related regulatory agreement.

Unbilled Revenues

Revenues from the sale of electricity and gas are recorded when they are delivered to customers. Sales quantity is measured by customers' meters. Due to the large volume of those meters, it is impractical to read all of them at month end. Meters are read on a systematic basis throughout the month based on established meter-reading schedules. Consequently, at the end of any month, there exists a quantity of electricity and gas that has been delivered to customers but has not been captured by the meter readings. As a result, management must estimate revenue related to electricity and gas delivered to customers between meter-read dates and the end of the reporting period. These estimates include:

•
The amount of electricity expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers (referred to as line loss) and the amount of electricity actually delivered to customers.

•
The amount of gas expected to be lost in the process of distribution to customers and the amount of gas actually delivered to customers.

•
The mix of sales between customer rate classes having different rates, which is based upon historical utilization assumptions.

MGE monitors the reasonableness of the unbilled revenue estimate through the review of ratios such as unbilled electric consumption compared to billed electric sales. To confirm the reasonableness of unbilled gas, the estimated unbilled consumption is compared to various other statistics, including percent of gas available for sale, change in unbilled month-to-month and change in unbilled compared to the prior year.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

MGE provides employees with certain retirement (pension) and postretirement (health care and life insurance) benefits. In order to measure the expense and obligations associated with these benefits, management must make a variety of estimates, including discount rates used to value certain liabilities, the expected return on plan assets set aside to fund these costs, the rate of compensation increase, employee turnover rates, retirement rates, health care trends, mortality rates, and other factors. These accounting estimates may change due to the uncertainty attached to the estimate as well as the fact that these estimates are difficult to measure. Different estimates used could result in recognizing different amounts of expense over different periods of time. Recovery in rates is expected.

MGE uses third-party specialists to assist with evaluating its assumptions and measurement of the costs and obligations associated with these retirement benefits. The discount rate and expected return on plan assets are based primarily on available investment yields and the historical performance of plan assets. They are critical accounting estimates because they are subject to management's judgment.

•
Assumed return on assets
. This assumption represents the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested (or to be invested) to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. For 2024, MGE used an assumed return on assets of 7.24% for pension and 6.81% for other postretirement benefits. In 2025, the pension asset assumption will decrease to 7.00% and the postretirement benefit assumption will increase to 7.00%. The annual expected rate of return is based on projected long-term equity and bond returns, maturities and asset allocations. Holding other assumptions constant, for every 1% reduction in the expected rate of return on plan assets, annual pension and other postretirement cost would increase by approximately $4.4 million, before taxes.

•
Discount rate
. The discount rate represents the rate at which pension obligations could effectively be settled on a present-value basis. MGE uses high-grade bond yields as a benchmark for determining the appropriate discount rate. MGE uses individual spot rates rather than a weighted average of the yield curve spot rates to measure the service cost and interest cost components for net periodic benefit cost. Holding other assumptions constant, a 0.5% decrease in the discount rate on the obligation balance as of December 31, 2024, would decrease annual pension and other postretirement cost by approximately $0.2 million, before taxes.

•
Medical trend assumptions
. The health care cost trend rate is the assumed rate of increase in per-capita health care charges.

44

•
Mortality rate assumption.
 Expected mortality rates are used in the valuation to determine the expected duration of future benefit payments to the plan participants. MGE utilizes mortality tables and projection scales developed by the society of actuaries. These tables and scales were last updated in 2021.

See 
Footnote 11
 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for additional discussion of these plans.

Income Tax Provision

MGE Energy's and MGE's income tax provisions, including both current and deferred components, are based on estimates, assumptions, calculations, and interpretation of tax statutes for the current and future years. Determination of current-year federal and state income tax will not be settled for years.

Management regularly makes assessments of tax return outcomes relative to financial statement tax provisions and adjusts the tax provisions in the period when facts become final.

Additionally, in determining the current income tax provision, an assessment is completed on temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are recorded in the balance sheets. For deferred tax assets, a likelihood assessment is completed to determine if these assets will be recovered through adjustments to future taxable income. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recorded for those benefits that do not meet this criterion. An allowance is recorded reducing the asset to a value that is believed to be recoverable based on the expectation of future taxable income. The accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is believed to be a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as it requires management to make assumptions about the future income over the lives of the deferred tax assets, and the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to the results of operations.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

MGE Energy and MGE are potentially exposed to market risk associated with interest rates, commodity prices, and equity returns. MGE currently has no exposure to foreign currency risk. MGE manages some risk exposure through risk management policies and the use of derivative instruments. MGE's risk management policy prohibits speculative trading transactions.

Commodity Price Risk

MGE has commodity price risk exposure with respect to the price of natural gas, electricity, coal, emission credits, and oil. MGE's electric operations burn natural gas in several of its power plants and, in many cases, the cost of purchased power is tied to the cost of natural gas. MGE employs established policies and procedures to reduce the market risks associated with changing commodity prices. MGE's commodity risks are substantially mitigated by the current ratemaking process in place for recovering electric fuel cost, purchased energy costs, and the cost of natural gas.

The recovery of MGE's electric fuel costs is subject to fuel rules established by the PSCW. Fuel rules require Wisconsin utilities to defer electric fuel-related costs that fall outside a symmetrical cost tolerance band. Any over or under recovery of the actual costs is determined in the following year and is then reflected in future billings to electric retail customers. MGE was subject to a plus or minus 2% range in 2024. MGE assumes the risks and benefits of variances that are within the cost tolerance band. For 2025, $72.3 million in fuel and purchased power costs is expected to be recovered in rates and are subject to this rule to the extent that actual costs vary from that amount. See 
Footnote 9.b.
 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for additional information on fuel rules.

MGE recovers the cost of natural gas in its gas utility segment through the purchased gas adjustment clause (PGA). Under the PGA, MGE is able to pass through to its gas customers the cost of gas. If the commodity costs of gas exceed a monthly benchmark amount, the excess amount is subject to a prudence review and approval by the PSCW before it can be passed through to customers.

MGE also reduces price risk caused by market fluctuations via physical contracts and financial derivative contracts, including futures, swaps, options, forwards, and other contractual commitments. The maximum length of time over which cash flows related to energy commodities can be hedged under applicable PSCW approvals is four years.

45

MGE has financial gas and electric commodity contracts to hedge commodity price risk in the gas and electric utility segments. These contracts are primarily comprised of exchange-traded option and future contracts. MGE also holds financial transmission rights (FTRs), which are used to hedge the risk of increased transmission congestion charges. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of exchange traded derivatives and FTRs exceed the cost basis by $0.1 million. Under the PGA clause and electric fuel rules, MGE may include the costs and benefits of the aforementioned fuel price risk management tools in the costs of fuel (natural gas or power). Because these costs or benefits are recoverable, the related unrealized loss or gain has been deferred on the consolidated balance sheets as a regulatory asset or liability, respectively.

Interest Rate Risk

Both MGE Energy and MGE may have short term borrowings at varying interest rates. MGE issues commercial paper for its short-term borrowings, while MGE Energy draws from its current credit facility to meet short-term borrowing needs. Borrowing levels vary from period to period depending upon capital investments and other factors. Future short-term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short-term interest rates and borrowing levels. MGE Energy and MGE manage interest rate risk by limiting their variable rate exposure and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates. MGE is not exposed to changes in interest rates on a substantial portion of its long-term debt until that debt matures and is refinanced at market rates. Assuming the current level of short-term borrowings and assuming a 1% change in the 2024 average interest rate under those borrowings, it is estimated that 2024 interest expense and net income would have increased/decreased by $0.4 million for both MGE Energy and MGE.

Equity Price Risk - Pension-Related Assets

MGE currently funds its liabilities related to employee benefits through trust funds. These funds, which include investments in debt and equity securities, are managed by various third-party investment managers. Changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities. Holding other assumptions constant, for every 1% reduction in the expected rate of return on plan assets, annual pension and other postretirement cost would increase by approximately $4.4 million, before taxes. MGE's risk of expense and annuity payments, as a result of changes in the market value of the trust funds, is mitigated in part through future rate actions by the PSCW. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the value of employee benefit plans trusts' assets increased in value by approximately 11% and 15%, respectively.

Credit Risk - Counterparty

Credit risk is the loss that may result from counterparty nonperformance. MGE is exposed to credit risk primarily through its merchant energy business. MGE uses credit policies to manage credit risk, which include an established credit approval process, counterparty limits, credit mitigation measures such as collateral or prepayment arrangements, and using netting agreements.

Due to the possibility of extreme volatility in the prices of energy commodities and derivatives, the market value of contractual positions with individual counterparties could exceed established credit limits or collateral provided by those counterparties. If such a counterparty were then to fail to perform its obligations under its contract (for example, fail to deliver the electricity MGE originally contracted for), MGE could sustain a loss that could have a material impact on its financial results.

Additionally, if a counterparty were to default and MGE were to liquidate all contracts with that entity, MGE's credit loss could include: the loss in value of mark-to-market contracts, the amount owed for settled transactions, and additional payments to settle unrealized losses. As of December 31, 2024, no counterparties had defaulted.

MGE is obligated to provide service to all electric and gas customers within its franchised territories. MGE's franchised electric territory includes a 264 square-mile area in Dane County, Wisconsin, and MGE's franchised gas territory includes a service area covering 1,684 square miles in Wisconsin. Based on results for the year ended December 31, 2024, no one customer constituted more than 10% of total operating revenues for MGE Energy and MGE. Credit risk for electric and gas is managed by MGE's credit and collection policies, which are consistent with state regulatory requirements.

Cash, cash equivalents, and customer accounts receivable are the financial instruments that potentially subject MGE Energy and MGE to concentrations of credit risk. MGE Energy and MGE place their cash and cash equivalents with high credit-quality financial institutions. MGE has limited concentrations of credit risk from customer accounts receivable because of the large number of customers and relatively strong economy in its service territory.

Report of Indepe
ndent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of MGE Energy, Inc.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, as listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1), and the financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2), of MGE Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.

Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Accounting for 
the Effects of Regulatory Matters

As described in Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recorded consistent with regulatory treatment. Regulatory assets represent costs which are deferred due to the probable future recovery from customers through regulated rates, while regulatory liabilities represent the excess recovery of costs or accrued credits which were deferred because management believes it is probable such amounts will be returned to customers through future regulated rates. As disclosed by management, management assesses whether the regulatory assets and liabilities meet the criteria for probability of future recovery or deferral. This assessment considers factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, recent rate orders to other regulated entities under the same jurisdiction, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized in the consolidated statements of income consistent with the recovery or refund included in customer rates. As of December 31, 2024, there was $45.3 million of regulatory assets and $171.3 million of regulatory liabilities.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to accounting for the effects of regulatory matters is a critical audit matter are a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to assessing the effects of regulatory matters on the accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities, including the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and deferral of regulatory liabilities.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s assessment of regulatory proceedings, including controls over the probability of recovery of regulatory assets, deferral of regulatory liabilities, and the related accounting and disclosure impacts. These procedures also included, among others, (i) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding the probability of recovery of regulatory assets and deferral of regulatory liabilities, (ii) assessing the effects of new or changes to existing rate orders on certain regulatory asset and liability balances, and (iii) testing, on a sample basis, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities by considering the provisions outlined in rate orders, applicable information from other correspondence with regulators, and applicable regulatory precedents.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022

This report is a combined report of MGE Energy and MGE. The notes to the consolidated financial statements that follow include consolidated MGE Energy footnotes and certain footnotes related to MGE as signified below.

1.
Summary of Sign
ificant Accounting Policies.

a.
Basis of Presentation - MGE Energy and MGE.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which give recognition to the rate making accounting policies for regulated operations

prescribed by the regulatory authorities having jurisdiction, principally the PSCW and FERC. MGE's accounting records conform to the FERC uniform system of accounts.

b.
Principles of Consolidation - MGE Energy and MGE.
MGE, a wholly owned subsidiary of MGE Energy, is a regulated electric and gas utility headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin. MGE Energy and MGE consolidate all majority owned subsidiaries in which they have a controlling influence.

Additional wholly owned subsidiaries of MGE Energy include CWDC, MAGAEL, MGE Power, MGE State Energy Services, MGE Services, MGE Transco, and MGEE Transco.

CWDC owns 
100
% of North Mendota, a subsidiary created to serve as a development entity for property. MGE Power owns 
100
% of MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus. MGE Power and its subsidiaries are part of MGE Energy's nonregulated energy operations, which were formed to own and lease electric generation projects to assist MGE. MGE Transco and MGEE Transco are nonregulated entities formed to own the investments in ATC and ATC Holdco, respectively. MGE did not own any subsidiaries as of 
December 31, 2024.

MGE Energy and MGE consolidate variable interest entities (VIEs) for which each is the primary beneficiary. Variable interest entities are legal entities that possess any of the following characteristics: equity investors who have an insufficient amount of equity at risk to finance their activities, equity owners who do not have the power to direct the significant activities of the entity (or have voting rights that are disproportionate to their ownership interest), or equity holders who do not receive expected losses or returns significant to the VIE. Ongoing reassessments of all VIEs are performed to determine if the primary beneficiary status has changed. MGE has consolidated MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus. Both entities are VIEs. See 
Footnote 3
 for more discussion of these entities.

The consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain accounting policies described in this note. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

c.
Use of Estimates - MGE Energy and MGE.
In order to prepare consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make estimates and assumptions. These estimates could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from management's estimates.

Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.

Restricted Cash
MGE has certain cash accounts that are restricted to uses other than current operations and designated for a specific purpose. MGE's restricted cash accounts include cash held by trustees for certain employee benefits and cash deposits held by third parties. These are included in "Other current assets" on the consolidated balance sheets.

Receivable – Margin Account
Cash amounts held by counterparties as margin collateral for certain financial transactions are recorded as Receivable – margin account in "Other current assets" on the consolidated balance sheets. The costs being hedged are fuel for electric generation, purchased power, and cost of gas sold.

e.
Trade Receivables, Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, and Concentration Risk - MGE Energy and MGE.
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. A 
1
% late payment charge is recorded on all receivables unpaid after the due date. The allowance for credit losses associated with these receivables represents MGE's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses for existing accounts receivable. MGE manages concentration of credit risk through its credit and collection policies, which are consistent with state regulatory requirements. The allowance for credit losses is estimated based on historical write-off experience, regional economic data, review of the accounts receivable aging, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, MGE had a reserve balance of $
9.0

million and $
8.1
 million, respectively, against accounts receivable. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, MGE recorded $
4.0

million and $
3.6
 million, respectively, in write-offs. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, MGE recorded $
4.9

million and $
3.3
 million, respectively, of additional reserves. The current accounting treatment for bad debt expense allows MGE to defer any differential between bad debt expense reflected in rates and actual costs incurred in its next rate case filing. See 
Footnote 8
 for further details of deferred bad debt expense.

f.
Inventories - MGE Energy and MGE.
Inventories consist of natural gas in storage, fuel for electric generation, materials and supplies, and renewable energy credits (RECs). MGE values natural gas in storage, fuel for electric generation, and materials and supplies using average cost. 
REC allowances are included in "Materials and supplies" on the consolidated balance sheets and are recorded based on specific identification. These allowances are charged to purchase power expense as they are used in operations.

g.
D
erivative and Hedging Instruments - MGE Energy and MGE.
As part of regular operations, MGE enters into contracts, including options, swaps, futures, forwards, and other contractual commitments, to manage its exposure to commodity prices. MGE recognizes derivatives, excluding those that qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales exclusion, in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, with changes in the fair value of derivative instruments to be recorded in current earnings or deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), depending on whether a derivative is designated as, and is effective as, a hedge and on the type of hedge transaction. Derivative activities are in accordance with the company's risk management policy.

If 
the derivative qualifies for regulatory deferral, the derivatives are marked to fair value and are offset with a corresponding regulatory asset or liability depending on whether the derivative is in a net loss or net gain position,

62

respectively. 
Cash flows from such derivative instruments are classified on a basis consistent with the nature of the underlying hedged item.

h.
Regulatory Assets and Liabilities - MGE Energy and MGE.
Regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recorded consistent with regulatory treatment. Regulatory assets represent costs which are deferred due to the probable future recovery from customers through regulated rates. Regulatory liabilities represent the excess recovery of costs or accrued credits which were deferred because MGE believes it is probable such amounts will be returned to customers through future regulated rates. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized in the consolidated statements of income consistent with the recovery or refund included in customer rates. MGE believes it is probable that its recorded regulatory assets and liabilities will be recovered and refunded, respectively, in future rates. See 
Footnote 8
 for further information.

i.
Debt Issuance Costs - MGE Energy and MGE.
Premiums, discounts, and expenses incurred with the issuance of outstanding long-term debt are amortized over the life of the debt issue. Any call premiums or unamortized expenses associated with refinancing higher-cost debt obligations used to finance utility-regulated assets and operations are amortized consistent with regulatory treatment of those items. These costs are included as a direct reduction to the related debt liability on the consolidated balance sheets.

j.
Property, Plant, and Equipment - MGE Energy and MGE.
Property, plant, and equipment is recorded at original cost. Cost includes indirect costs consisting of payroll taxes, pensions, postretirement benefits, other fringe benefits, and administrative and general costs. Also, included in the cost is AFUDC for utility property and capitalized interest for nonregulated property. Additions for significant replacements of property are charged to property, plant, and equipment at cost; and minor items are charged to maintenance expense. Depreciation rates on utility property are approved by the PSCW, based on the estimated economic lives of property, and include estimates for salvage value and removal costs. Removal costs of utility property, less any salvage value, are adjusted through regulatory liabilities. Depreciation rates on nonregulated property are based on the estimated economic lives of the property. See 
Footnote 4
 for further information.

Provisions at composite straight-line depreciation rates approximate the following percentages for the cost of depreciable property:

k.
Asset Retirement Obligations - MGE Energy and MGE.
A liability is recorded for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation (ARO) to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated. The offsetting associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as a long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. The expected present value technique used to calculate the fair value of ARO liabilities includes assumptions about costs, probabilities, settlement dates, interest accretion, and inflation. Revisions to the assumptions, including the timing or amount of expected asset retirement costs, could result in increases or decreases to the AROs. All asset retirement obligations are recorded as "Asset retirement obligations" on the consolidated balance sheets. MGE has regulatory treatment and recognizes regulatory assets or liabilities for the timing differences between when it recovers legal AROs in rates and when it would recognize these costs. See 
Footnote 17
 for further information.

l.
Repairs and Maintenance Expense - MGE Energy and MGE.
MGE utilizes the direct expensing method for planned major maintenance projects. Under this method, MGE expenses all costs associated with major planned maintenance activities as incurred.

m.
Purchased Gas Adjustment Clause - MGE Energy and MGE.
MGE's natural gas rates are subject to a fuel adjustment clause designed to recover or refund the difference between the actual cost of purchased gas and the amount included in rates. Differences between the amounts billed to customers and the actual costs recoverable are deferred and recovered or refunded in future periods by means of prospective monthly

63

adjustments to rates. 
These amounts are included as a regulatory asset or liability depending on whether MGE is under-collected or over-collected actual costs.
 See 
Footnote 8
 for further information.

n.
Revenue Recognition - MGE Energy and MGE.
Operating revenues are recorded as service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers. Meters are read on a systematic basis throughout the month based on established meter-reading schedules. At the end of the month, MGE accrues an estimate for the unbilled amount of energy delivered to customers. The unbilled revenue estimate is based on daily system demand volumes, weather factors, estimated line losses, estimated customer usage by class, and applicable customer rates. See 
Footnote 20
 for further information.

o.
Utility Cost Recovery - MGE Energy and MGE.
MGE's tariff rates include a provision for fuel cost recovery. The PSCW allows Wisconsin utilities to defer electric fuel-related costs that fall outside a symmetrical cost tolerance band around the amount approved for a utility in its annual fuel proceedings. Any over- or under-recovery of the actual costs is determined in the following year and is then reflected in future billings to electric retail customers. Over-collection of fuel-related costs that are outside the approved range will be recognized as a reduction of revenue. Under-collection of these costs will be recognized in "Purchased power" expense in the consolidated statements of income. The cumulative effects of these deferred amounts will be recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability until they are reflected in future billings to customers. See 
Footnote 9.b.
 for further information.

p.
Regional Transmission Organizations - MGE Energy and MGE.
MGE reports on a net basis transactions on the MISO markets in which it buys and sells power within the same hour to meet electric energy delivery requirements.

q.
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction - MGE Energy and MGE.
Allowance for funds used during construction is included in utility plant accounts and represents the cost of borrowed funds used during plant construction and a return on shareholder's capital used for construction purposes. In the consolidated income statements, the cost of borrowed funds (AFUDC-debt) is presented as an offset to "Interest expense, net" and the return on shareholder's capital (AFUDC-equity funds) is shown as an item within "Other income, net." 
For 
2024, 2023, and 2022
, as approved by the PSCW, MGE capitalized AFUDC-debt and equity on 
50
% of applicable average construction work in progress as shown in the following table:

For the years ended 
2024, 2023, and 2022, MGE recorded AFUDC-debt and AFUDC-equity as shown in the following table:

r.
Investments - MGE Energy and MGE.
Investments in limited liability companies that have specific ownership accounts in which MGE Energy or MGE's ownership interest is more than minor and are considered to have significant influence are accounted for using the equity method. For equity security investments without readily determinable fair values and for which MGE Energy and MGE do not have significant influence, MGE Energy and MGE have elected to use the practicability exception to measure these investments, defined as cost adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, less impairment. Changes in measurement are reported in earnings. Equity security investments with readily determinable fair values are carried at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in earnings. See 
Footnote 7
 for further information on investments and 
Footnote 19
 for further information on fair value of investments.

s.
Capitalized Software Costs - MGE Energy and MGE.
The net book value of capitalized costs of internal use software included in property, plant, and equipment was $
67.5
 million and $
77.2
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023,

64

accumulated amortization was $
74.4
 million and $
63.9
 million, respectively. For the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, MGE recorded $
10.5
 million, $
10.4
 million and $
10.8
 million, respectively, of amortization expense. Capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives range from 
three
 to 
fifteen
 years.

t.
Capitalized Software Assets – Hosting Arrangements – MGE Energy and MGE.
The net book value of capitalized costs of internal use software incurred in a hosting arrangement was $
8.5

million and $
10.7

million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, accumulated amortization was $
14.6
 million and $
11.4
 million, respectively. Capitalized software assets for hosted arrangements and the related accumulated amortization expense are recorded in "Other deferred assets and other" on the consolidated balance sheets.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, MGE recorded $
3.2
 million, $
2.9
 million, and $
3.1
 million, respectively, of amortization expense related to software assets for hosted arrangements. These costs are recognized in "Other operations and maintenance" expense in the consolidated statements of income and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the hosted contract, which includes renewable option periods. Software assets for hosted arrangements have terms ranging from
 three 
to
 thirteen
 years.

u.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - MGE Energy and MGE.
MGE reviews plant and equipment and other property for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. MGE's policy for determining when long-lived assets are impaired is to recognize an impairment loss if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) from an asset are less than the carrying amount of that asset. If an impairment loss is recognized, the amount that will be recorded will be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.

When it becomes probable that a generating unit will be retired before the end of its useful life, MGE assesses whether the generating unit meets the criteria for probability of abandonment. If a generating unit meets the applicable criteria to be considered probable of abandonment, MGE assesses the likelihood of recovery of the remaining net book value of that generating unit at the end of each reporting period. If it becomes probable that regulators will disallow full recovery or a return on the remaining net book value of a generating unit that is either abandoned or probable of being abandoned, an impairment loss would be required. An impairment loss would be recorded for the difference of the remaining net book value of the generating unit that is greater than the present value of the amount expected to be recovered from ratepayers. There was 
no
 significant impairment of long-lived assets during 
2024, 2023, and 2022
.

v.
Income Taxes and Excise Taxes - MGE Energy and MGE.

Income taxes
Under the balance sheet method, income taxes are deferred for all temporary differences between pretax financial and taxable income and between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the tax rates scheduled by law to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. A valuation allowance is recorded for those benefits that do not meet this criterion.

Accounting for uncertainty in income taxes applies to all tax positions and requires a recognition threshold and measurement standard for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in an income tax return. The threshold is defined for recognizing tax return positions in the financial statements as "more likely than not" that the position is sustainable, based on its merits. Subsequent recognition, derecognition, and measurement is based on management's best judgment given the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date.

Regulatory and accounting principles have resulted in a regulatory liability related to income taxes. Excess deferred income taxes result from past taxes provided in customer rates higher than current rates. The income tax regulatory liability and deferred investment tax credit reflect the revenue requirement associated with the return of these tax benefits to customers.

Investment tax credits from regulated operations are amortized over related property service lives.

65

Transfer tax credits
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allows the transfer of certain tax credits to third parties in exchange for cash. In 2024, MGE sold transfer eligible tax credits generated in 2023 and 2024. MGE elects to account for the transferred tax credits under the scope of ASC 740. The sale of tax credits is presented in the operating activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows consistent with the presentation of cash taxes paid. MGE includes any expected proceeds from the transfer of tax credits in the evaluation of realizability of deferred tax assets related to tax credits and records a valuation allowance for the difference between the tax value of the credits and the expected proceeds. The PSCW approved the deferral by MGE of any differential between tax credit transfer proceeds and the tax value of credits reflected in rates to its next rate case filing.

Excise taxes
MGE Energy, through its utility operations, pays a state license fee tax in lieu of property taxes on property used in utility operations. License fee tax is calculated as a percentage of adjusted operating revenues of the prior year. The electric tax rate is 
3.19
% for retail sales and 
1.59
% for sales of electricity for resale by the purchaser. The tax rate on sales of natural gas is 
0.97
%. The tax is required to be estimated and prepaid in the year prior to its computation and expensing. License fee tax expense, included in "Other general taxes," was $
17.0
 million, $
16.5
 million, and $
14.7
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Operating income taxes, including tax credits and license fee tax, are included in rates for utility related items.

w.
Share-Based Compensation - MGE Energy and MGE.
Eligible employees and non-employee directors may receive awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units, and dividend equivalents, or any combination of the foregoing. 
Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Awards classified as equity awards are measured based on their grant-date fair value. Awards classified as liability awards are recorded at fair value each reporting period. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur, rather than estimating potential future forfeitures and recording them over the vesting period. See 
Footnote 12
 for additional information on MGE's share-based compensation plans.

2.
New Acco
unting Standards - MGE Energy and MGE.

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board modified authoritative guidance within the codification's Segment Reporting topic, which enhanced the disclosure requirements for significant segment expenses and other segment items. The authoritative guidance became effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. MGE adopted the standard as of the effective date. See 
Footnote 22
 for segment disclosures.

In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative guidance within the codification's Income Taxes topic, which expanded the disclosure requirements over effective tax rate reconciliations and income taxes paid. For public business entities, the authoritative guidance will become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. MGE will adopt the standard as of the effective date. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on MGE Energy's and MGE's income, comprehensive income, financial position or cash flows.

In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative guidance within the codification's Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income topic, which added disclosure requirements for the disaggregation of certain income statement expenses. The authoritative guidance will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027. MGE will adopt the standard as of the effective date. The adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on MGE Energy's and MGE's income, comprehensive income, financial position or cash flows.

3.
Variable Inte
rest Entities - MGE Energy and MGE.

MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus are not subsidiaries of MGE, but they have been consolidated in the financial statements of MGE. MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus were created for the purpose of owning new generating assets and leasing those assets to MGE. MGE Power Elm Road's sole principal asset is an undivided ownership interest in two coal-fired generating plants (the Elm Road Units) located in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, which it leases to MGE pursuant to long-term leases. MGE Power West Campus's sole principal asset is an ownership interest in WCCF, which it leases to MGE pursuant to a long-term lease. Based on the nature and terms of the contractual agreements, MGE is expected to absorb a majority of the expected losses or residual value associated with the ownership of the generation assets by MGE

66

Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus and therefore MGE holds a variable interest despite the absence of an equity interest.

In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, MGE Energy and MGE consolidate VIEs of which they are the primary beneficiary. MGE has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact both the Elm Road Units' and the WCCF's economic performance and is also the party most closely associated with MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus. As a result, MGE is the primary beneficiary.

MGE has included the following significant accounts on its consolidated balance sheets related to its interest in these VIEs as of December 31:

(b)
An asset that will be retired in the near future and substantially in advance of its previously expected retirement date is subject to abandonment accounting. In the second quarter of 2021, the operator of Columbia received approval from MISO to retire Columbia Units 1 and 2. The co-owners intend to retire Unit 1 and Unit 2 by the end of 2029. Final timing and retirement dates are subject to change depending on operational, regulatory, capacity needs, and other factors impacting one or more of the Columbia co-owners. As of 
December 31, 2024
, early retirement of Columbia was probable. "Plant anticipated to be retired early" in table above is the net book value of these generating units. Assets for Columbia Unit 1 and Unit 2 are currently included in rate base, and MGE continues to depreciate them on a straight-line basis using the composite depreciation rates approved by the PSCW that included retirement dates of 2029 for Unit 1 and Unit 2. If it becomes probable that regulators will disallow full recovery or a return on the remaining net book value of a generating unit that is either abandoned or probable of being abandoned, an impairment loss would be required. An impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the remaining net book value of the generating unit exceeds the present value of the amount expected to be recovered from ratepayers. 
No
 impairment was recorded as of 
December 31, 2024
.

5.
Leas
es - MGE Energy and MGE.

As part of its regular operations, MGE enters into various contracts related to IT equipment, substations, cell towers, land, wind easements, and other property in use for operations. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Determination as to whether an arrangement is or contains a lease is completed at inception. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets; lease expense for these leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leases with initial terms in excess of 12 months are recorded as operating or financing leases on the consolidated balance sheets.

Operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. For leases that do not provide an implicit rate, a collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date, including lease term, is used in determining the present value of future payments. The operating lease asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As of December 31, 2024
, MGE had no significant leases not yet commenced that would create significant future rights and obligations.

(a)
MGE and the other co-owners announced plans to retire Columbia, a two unit coal-fired generation facility located in Portage, Wisconsin.

The co-owners intend to retire Unit 1 and Unit 2 by 2029. Final timing and retirement dates are subject to change depending on operational, regulatory, capacity needs, and other factors impacting one or more of the Columbia co-owners. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, early retirement of Columbia was probable. See 
Footnote 4
 for further information.
(b)
Two coal-fired generating units in Oak Creek, Wisconsin.

In 2021, MGE announced plans to end the use of coal as a primary fuel at the Elm Road Units and transition the plant to natural gas. By the end of 2030, MGE expects coal to be used only as a backup fuel at the Elm Road Units. This transition will help MGE meet its 2030 carbon reduction goals. By the end of 2032, MGE expects that the Elm Road Units will be fully transitioned away from coal, which will eliminate coal as an internal generation source for MGE.
(c)
MGE Power West Campus and the UW jointly own the West Campus Cogeneration Facility (WCCF) located on the UW campus in Madison, Wisconsin. The UW owns a controlling interest in the chilled-water and steam plants, which are used to meet the needs for air-conditioning and steam-heat capacity for the UW campus. MGE Power West Campus owns a controlling interest in the electric generation plant, which is leased and operated by MGE.
(d)
In March 2023, MGE purchased an ownership interest in West Riverside, a natural gas-fired facility located in Beloit, WI, from WPL, operator and co-owner of the plant. West Riverside was placed in-service in 2020. In June 2024, MGE purchased an additional ownership interest in West Riverside, increasing its interest to 6.9%.
(e)
Operating charges are allocated to the UW based on formulas contained in the operating agreement. Under the provisions of this arrangement, the UW is required to reimburse MGE for their allocated portion of fuel and operating expenses. For the years ended December 31, 
2024, 2023, and 2022
, the UW's allocated share of fuel and operating costs was $
7.0

MGE expects to recover its regulatory assets and return its regulatory liabilities through rates charged to customers based on PSCW decisions made during the ratemaking process or based on PSCW long-standing policies and guidelines. The adjustments to rates for these regulatory assets and liabilities will occur over the periods either specified by the PSCW or over the corresponding period related to the asset or liability. Management believes it is probable that MGE will continue to recover from customers the regulatory assets described above based on prior and current ratemaking treatment for such costs. All regulatory assets for which a cash outflow had been made are earning a return.

Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO)
The recovery of the underlying asset investments and related removal and monitoring costs of recorded AROs is approved by the PSCW in depreciation rates. MGE records a regulatory asset and a regulatory liability for timing differences between the recognition of AROs for financial reporting purposes and the recovery of these costs from customers. The recovery period approximates the useful life of the assets to be removed. See 
Footnote 17
 for a discussion of asset retirement obligations.

Bad debt expense
In March 2020, the PSCW issued an order authorizing deferral of expenditures incurred to ensure the provision of safe, reliable, and affordable access to utility services during the COVID-19 pandemic and late payment charges. Expenditures include items such as bad debt expense. Recovery of these expenditures is occurring during 2024 and 2025. Beginning in 2021, the PSCW approved MGE to defer any differential between bad debt expense reflected in rates and actual costs incurred in its next rate filing.

Debt Related Costs
This balance includes debt issuance costs of extinguished debt and other debt related expenses, including make-whole premiums paid on redemptions of long-term debt. The PSCW has allowed rate recovery on unamortized issuance costs for extinguished debt facilities. When the facility replacing the old facility is deemed by the PSCW to be more favorable for the ratepayers, the PSCW will allow rate recovery of any unamortized issuance costs related to the old facility.

Derivatives
MGE has physical and financial contracts that are accounted for as derivatives. The amounts recorded for the net mark-to-market value of the commodity based contracts is offset with a corresponding regulatory asset or liability because these transactions are part of the PGA or fuel rules clause authorized by the PSCW. See 
Footnote 18
 for further discussion.

Fuel Costs/Savings 
See 
Footnote 9.b.
 for discussion regarding the rules affecting our fuel-related costs.

Leases
For ratemaking all leases are treated as operating leases. MGE has regulatory treatment and recognizes regulatory assets or liabilities for timing differences between net lease costs recognized and lease cash payments made. See 
Footnote 5
 for further information.

Pension and Other Postretirement Costs
The current accounting treatment for Pension and Other Postretirement costs allows MGE to reflect any differential between pension and other postretirement costs reflected in rates and actual costs incurred in its next rate filing.

Tax Recovery Related to AFUDC Equity
AFUDC equity represents the after-tax equity cost associated with utility plant construction and results in a temporary difference between the book and tax basis of such plant. Tax recovery related to AFUDC equity represents the revenue requirement related to recovery of these future taxes payable, calculated at current statutory tax rates.

Transmission Costs
The current accounting treatment for transmission costs allows MGE to reflect any differential between transmission costs reflected in rates and actual costs incurred in its next rate filing.

Unfunded or funded Pension and Other Postretirement Asset or Liability

MGE records unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses as a net regulatory asset or liability in lieu of accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss on the balance sheet, as these amounts are expected to be recovered or refunded in future rates. See 
Footnote 11
 for further discussion.

Cost of Removal

The PSCW allows MGE to collect amounts from customers through depreciation rates to fund future asset removal activities. This regulatory liability is reduced as costs are incurred to remove the assets at the end of their useful lives.

Elm Road
Costs associated with Elm Road for lease payments, management fees, community impact mitigation, and operating costs.

Income Taxes

Excess deferred income taxes result from a decrease in tax rates subsequent to ratemaking settlements. The settlements were reached using tax rates that are higher than the currently applicable rates, and MGE is required to return these tax benefits to customers. The regulatory liability and deferred investment tax credit reflects the revenue requirement associated with the return of these tax benefits to customers.

Changes in income taxes are generally passed through in customer rates for the regulated utility. The one-time 2017 impact on timing differences related to income taxes passed through to customer rates of the 2017 Tax Act was recorded as a regulatory liability. The amount and timing of the cash impacts will depend on the period over which certain income tax benefits are provided to customers, which will be subject to review by the PSCW. A portion of the regulatory liability will be returned to customers based on a mandated timeframe dictated by applicable tax laws.

Pension and Other Postretirement Non-Service Costs
These Pension and Other Postretirement non-service costs represents the non-service components of net periodic benefit cost capitalized in rates. The FASB issued authoritative guidance within the codification's Compensation-Retirement Benefits topic that only allows the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization within the consolidated balance sheets, all non-service costs are expensed. Under the current rate structure non-service cost is eligible for capitalization. The portion of net periodic benefit costs that are capitalized are being recovered as a component of depreciation expense. The non-service capitalized costs will be recovered in rates over the depreciable life of the asset for which net periodic benefit costs was applied. See 
Footnote 11
 for further discussion.

Purchased Gas Adjustment
MGE's natural gas rates are subject to a fuel adjustment clause designed to recover or refund the difference between the actual cost of purchased gas and the amount included in rates. Differences between the amounts billed to customers and the actual costs recoverable are deferred and recovered or refunded in future periods by means of prospective monthly adjustments to rates.

Renewable Project Savings
The PSCW requires MGE to defer the revenue requirement impact for the change of the in-service date for Paris to a future rate proceeding.

(a)
The electric rate increase was driven by generation assets including MGE's investments in Badger Hollow II (solar), Paris (solar and battery), Red Barn Wind Farm (wind), and West Riverside (natural gas). In addition, the reopener request included an increase in fuel costs and the recovery of deferred 2021 fuel costs. The reopener also revised the depreciation schedule for Columbia Unit 2 and shared equipment to 2029 to align with the depreciation schedule for Unit 1. 
(b)
The electric increase was driven by an increase in rate base including 
MGE's investments made in West Riverside, local solar, continued investment in grid modernization, as well as higher costs for transmission, pension and OPEB, and uncollectible costs (including costs previously deferred from prior years). This increase in electric costs is offset by a decrease in fuel costs and benefit from lower tax expense (including impacts from the Inflation Reduction Act). In addition, the PSCW authorized MGE to defer a recovery of and a return on costs associated for any change in the in service date for Paris and force majeure costs for Badger Hollow II and Paris that were not reflected in this rate filing. The PSCW also approved deferral of any differential in PTC tax credits reflected in rates and actual credits produced. These deferrals will be reflected in MGE's next rate case filing. The gas rate increases were also driven by MGE's 
investment made in grid modernization and higher pension and OPEB and uncollectible costs (including costs previously deferred from prior years). This increase in gas costs is offset by a tax benefit related to excess deferred taxes. Included in the gas residential rate is a reduction in the customer fixed charge.
(c)
The 2024/2025 rate order includes an earnings sharing mechanism, under which, if MGE earns above the authorized Return on Equity (ROE) in the rate order: (i) the utility will retain 100.0% of earnings for the first 15 basis points above the authorized ROE; (ii) 50.0% of the next 60 basis points will be required to be deferred and returned to customers; and (iii) 100.0% of any remaining excess earnings will be required to be refunded to customers. The earnings calculation excludes fuel rules adjustments. See "Fuel Rules" below.
(d)
The PSCW approved a 2025 Fuel Cost Plan in December 2024. The plan lowered the 2025 increase in electric rates to 2.63% to reflect lower expected fuel costs. 

Sierra Club and Vote Solar filed petitions with the Dane County Circuit Court seeking review of the PSCW decisions approving MGE's electric and gas 2022/2023 rate settlement, 2023 electric limited reopener, and 2024/2025 rate order. The PSCW was named as the responding party; MGE was not named as a party. The Petitions challenged the amount of customer fixed charge that does not vary with usage. The requested relief was unclear. The revenue requirement approved by the PSCW in the settlement, limited reopener, and 2024/2025 rate order had been challenged. The PSCW is expected to vigorously defend its approval of the rate case settlement, limited reopener, and the 2024/2025 rate order. MGE intervened in the proceedings to help defend the PSCW's decision. The Dane County Circuit Court affirmed the PSCW's decision to approve the 2022/2023 rate settlement, and Sierra Club and Vote Solar appealed that decision to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals. On August 6, 2024, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals denied Sierra Club and Vote Solar's appeal and affirmed the PSCW's approval of the 2022/2023 rate settlement. Sierra Club and Vote Solar petitioned the Wisconsin Supreme Court for review of the Court of Appeals decision, and the PSCW and MGE both filed responses asking the Wisconsin Supreme Court to deny the petition. The petitions challenging the 2023 electric limited reopener and the 2024/2025 rate order were stayed pending further proceedings. On January 16, 2025, the Wisconsin Supreme Court denied the petition for review. As a result, all cases concerning these matters pending in the Dane County Circuit Court have been dismissed.

b.
Fuel 
Rules.

Fuel rules require Wisconsin utilities to defer electric fuel-related costs that fall outside a symmetrical cost tolerance band around the amount approved for a utility in its annual fuel proceedings. Any over- or under-recovery of the actual costs is determined in the following year and is then reflected in future billings to electric retail customers. The fuel rules bandwidth is set at plus or minus 
2
%
 in 2024
 and 
2023. The electric fuel-related costs are subject to an excess revenues test. Excess revenues are defined as revenues in the year in question that provide MGE with a greater return on common equity than authorized by the PSCW in MGE's latest rate order. The recovery of under-collected electric fuel-related costs would be reduced by the amount that exceeds the excess revenue test. These costs are subject to the PSCW's annual

review 
of fuel costs completed in the year following the deferral.

Unrecognized tax benefits are classified with "Other deferred liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets. The interest component recoverable in rates is offset by a regulatory asset.

As of December 31, 2022, MGE Energy and MGE had an unrecognized tax benefit primarily related to temporary tax differences associated with the change in income tax method of accounting for electric generation and electric and gas distribution repairs. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, MGE Energy and MGE continue to have an unrecognized tax benefit associated with the change in income tax method of accounting for electric generation and electric distribution repairs, however, the tax benefit relating to gas distribution repairs has been recognized due to the adoption of the safe harbor method of accounting for gas repairs issued by the Internal Revenue Service in 2023.

The unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024
, are not expected to significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. In addition, statutes of limitations will expire for MGE Energy and MGE tax returns. The impact of the statutes of limitations expiring is not anticipated to be material.

The components of net periodic benefit cost, other than the service cost component, are recorded in "
Other income, net
"
 on the consolidated statements of income. The service cost component is recorded in "Other operations and maintenance" on the consolidated statements of income. MGE has regulatory treatment and recognizes regulatory assets or liabilities for timing differences between when net periodic benefit costs are recovered and when costs are recognized. The deferred costs have not been reflected in the table above. See 
Footnote 8

MGE employs a building-block approach in determining the expected long-term rate of return for asset classes. Historical markets are studied and long-term historical relationships among asset classes are analyzed, consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run. Current market factors, such as interest rates and dividend yields, are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined.

The expected long-term nominal rate of return for plan assets is primarily a function of expected long-term real rates of return for component asset classes and the plan's target asset allocation in conjunction with an inflation assumption. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for appropriateness.

d.
Investment Strategy.

MGE employs a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equities, fixed income, and real estate investments are used to maximize the expected long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan-funded status, and corporate financial condition. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity, fixed income, and real estate investments. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through periodic investment portfolio reviews and liability measurements.

Pension Plan Assets
The asset allocation for MGE's pension plans as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the target allocation for 2025, by asset category, follows:

Other Postretirement Plan Assets
Other Postretirement plan assets are comprised of specific assets within certain defined benefit pension plans (401(h) assets) as well as assets held in VEBA trusts. The asset allocation for MGE's 401(h) assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the target allocation for 2025, by asset category, follows:

The target asset allocation for the VEBA trusts are established based on a similar investment strategy as the 401(h) assets, with consideration for liquidity needs in the VEBA trusts.

e.
Concentrations of Credit Risk.

MGE evaluated its pension and other postretirement benefit plans' asset portfolios for the existence of significant concentrations of credit risk as of December 31, 2024. Types of concentrations that were evaluated include, but are not limited to, investment concentrations in a single entity, type of industry, and foreign country. As of December 31, 2024
, there were 
no
 significant concentrations (defined as greater than 
10
 percent of plan assets) of risk in MGE pension and postretirement benefit plan assets.

f.
Fair Value Measurements of Plan Assets.

Pension and other postretirement benefit plan investments are recorded at fair value. See 
Footnote 19
 for more information regarding the fair value hierarchy.

The following descriptions are the categories of underlying plan assets held within the pension and other postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2024:

Cash and Cash Equivalents
 – This category includes highly liquid investments with maturities of less than three months which are traded in active markets.

Equity Securities
 – These securities consist of U.S. and international stock funds. The U.S. stock funds are primarily invested in domestic equities. Securities in these funds are typically priced using the closing price from the applicable exchange, NYSE, Nasdaq, etc. The international funds are composed of international equities. Securities are priced using the closing price from the appropriate local stock exchange.

Fixed Income Securities
 – These securities consist of U.S. bond funds and short-term funds. U.S. bond funds are priced by a pricing agent using inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, and issuer spreads. The short-term funds are valued initially at cost and adjusted for amortization of any discount or premium.

Real Estate
 – Real estate funds are funds with a direct investment in pools of real estate properties. These funds are valued by investment managers on a periodic basis using pricing models that use independent appraisals.

Insurance Continuance Fund
 – The Insurance Continuance Fund is a supplemental retirement plan that includes assets that had been segregated and restricted to pay retiree term life insurance premiums.

Fixed Rate Fund
 – The Fixed Rate fund is supported by an underlying portfolio of fixed income securities, including public bonds, commercial mortgages, and private placement bonds. Public market data and GAAP reported market values are used when available to determine fair value.

All of the fair values of MGE's plan assets are measured using net asset value, except for cash and cash equivalents which are considered level 1 investments.

Expected Cash Flows.

MGE does not expect to need to make any required contributions to the qualified plans for 2025. The contributions for years after 2025 are not yet currently estimated. MGE has adopted the asset smoothing as permitted in accordance with the Pension Protection Act of 2006, including modifications made by WRERA.

Due to uncertainties in the future economic performance of plan assets, discount rates, and other key assumptions, estimated contributions are subject to change. MGE may also elect to make additional discretionary contributions.

MGE expects to contribute $
2.4
 million and $
0.4
 million to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans respectively in 2025.

Share-Based Compe
nsation - MGE Energy and MGE.

In 2020, MGE Energy shareholders approved the 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2021 Incentive Plan). It provides for the issuance of up to 
500,000
 shares of MGE Energy common stock in connection with awards made under the 2021 Incentive Plan. The 2021 Incentive Plan authorizes awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units, and dividend equivalents, or any combination of the foregoing for eligible employees and non-employee directors. The 2020 Performance Unit Plan (the 2020 Plan) was adopted in February 2020 for eligible employees and is an inactive plan with final award paid to employees in 2023. Plan participants may have received awards of performance units, restricted units, or both. Prior to the adoption of the 2020 plan, eligible employees could receive awards of performance units under the 2006 Performance Unit Plan, an inactive plan with final award paid to employees in 2024. Under the 2013 Director Incentive Plan, an inactive plan with final award paid to participants in 2023, enabled eligible non-employee directors to receive awards of performance units. For the years ended December 31, 
2024, 2023, and 2022, MGE recorded $
4.5
 million, $
2.7
 million, and $
1.3
 million, respectively, related to share-based compensation awards under the 2006 Performance Unit Plan, the 2020 Performance Unit Plan, the 2013 Director Incentive Plan, and the 2021 Incentive Plan in "Other operations and maintenance" on the consolidated statements of income.

82

2006 Performance Unit Plan - Liability Awards - 
Under the 2006 Performance Unit Plan, eligible employees could receive performance units that entitled the holder to receive a cash payment equal to the value of a designated number of shares of MGE Energy's common stock, plus dividend equivalent payments thereon, at the end of the performance period set in the award. In accordance with the plans' provisions. These awards are subject to prescribed vesting schedules and must be settled in cash. Accordingly, 
no
 shares of common stock will be issued in connection with the plan.
On the grant date, the cost of the employee services received in exchange for a performance unit award is measured based on the current market value of MGE Energy common stock. The fair value of the awards is remeasured quarterly, as required by applicable accounting standards. Changes in fair value as well as the original grant are recognized as compensation cost. Since this amount is remeasured throughout the vesting period, the compensation cost is subject to variability. For nonretirement eligible employees under the 2006 Performance Unit Plan, stock-based compensation costs are accrued and recognized using the graded vesting method. Compensation cost for retirement eligible employees or employees that will become retirement eligible during the vesting schedule are recognized on an abridged horizon as retirement eligibility accelerates vesting.
Payouts under the 2006 Performance Unit Plan are subject to a 
five
-year vesting schedule.

Restricted Stock Units - Equity Awards
 - Payouts of restricted stock units under the 2021 Incentive Plan are based on the expiration of a 
three
-year time-vesting period. Restricted stock units granted are to be paid out in shares of MGE Energy common stock and are accounted for as equity awards. The fair value of each restricted stock unit granted is based on the closing market price of one share of MGE Energy common stock on the grant date of the award. Compensation expense is recorded ratably over the performance period based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date.

11,213

Performance Units - Liability Awards
 - Performance units under the 2021 Incentive Plan can be paid out in shares of MGE Energy common stock, cash or a combination of cash and stock. MGE assumes it will make future payouts of its performance units granted in cash; therefore, these performance units are accounted for as liability awards. Compensation expense for these performance units is recorded ratably over the performance period based on the fair value of the awards at each reporting period. The payout is based upon achievement of specified performance goals during a performance period set by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of MGE Energy's Board of Directors. Awards are subject to vesting provisions providing for 100% vesting at the end of the performance period. Compensation cost for retirement eligible

83

employees or employees that will become retirement eligible during the vesting schedule are recognized on an abridged horizon as retirement eligibility accelerates vesting.
The performance units contain market and performance conditions. The market condition is based on total shareowner return relative to an investor-owned utility peer group. The performance condition is based on achievement of targets specified in the award agreement (such as an earnings growth target). The fair value of each performance unit is based on the fair value of the underlying common stock on the grant date and the probability of satisfying the market and performance conditions contained in the award agreement during the 
three
-year performance period. The actual payments upon vesting depends upon actual performance and may range from 
zero
 to 
200
% of the granted number of performance units.

Common Equ
ity.

a.
Common Stock - MGE Energy and MGE.

MGE Energy sells shares of its common stock through its Direct Stock Purchase and Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the Stock Plan). Those shares may be newly issued shares or shares that are purchased in the open market by an independent agent for participants in the Stock Plan. Sales of newly issued shares under the Stock Plan are covered by a shelf registration statement that MGE Energy filed with the SEC.
 During
 the year ended 
December 31, 2024, MGE Energy issued 
a
pproximately 
314,000
 new shares of common stock. The net proceeds from these issuances were approximately $
31.6
 million, which were used for general corporate purposes.

For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, MGE Energy paid $
63.6
 million (or $
1.76
 per share) and $
60.4
 million (or $
1.67
 per share), respectively, in cash dividends on its common stock. Dividend payments by MGE to MGE Energy are subject to restrictions arising under a PSCW rate order and, to a lesser degree, MGE's first mortgage bonds. The PSCW order restricts any dividends, above the PSCW authorized amount that MGE may pay MGE Energy if MGE's common equity ratio, calculated in the manner used in the rate proceeding, is less than 
55
%. This restriction did not restrict MGE's payment of dividends in 
2024. See 
Footnote 14
 for further discussion of the mortgage indenture covenants regarding the payment of dividends. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, MGE paid $
34.5
 million and $
41.0
 million, respectively, in cash dividends to MGE Energy.

Commitments and Contin
gencies.

a.
Environmental - MGE Energy and MGE.

Columbia
In February 2021, MGE and the other co-owners of Columbia announced plans to retire Units 1 and 2 at that facility. Effects of the environmental compliance requirements discussed below will depend upon the final Columbia retirement dates approved and required compliance dates.

Water Quality
Water quality regulations promulgated by the EPA and WDNR in accordance with the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, commonly known as the Clean Water Act, impose restrictions on discharges of various pollutants into surface waters. The Clean Water Act also regulates surface water quality issues that affect aquatic life, such as water temperatures, chemical concentrations, intake structures, and wetlands filling into Waters of the U.S., defined by EPA regulation. The Clean Water Act also includes discharge standards, which require the use of effluent-treatment processes equivalent to categorical "best practicable" or "best available" technologies. The Clean Water Act regulates discharges from "point

86

sources," such as power plants, by establishing discharge limits via water discharge permits. MGE's power plants operate under Wisconsin Pollution Discharge Elimination System (WPDES) permits issued by the WDNR to ensure compliance with these discharge limits. Permits are subject to periodic renewal.

Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for Steam Electric Power Generating Point Source Category
The EPA promulgated water Effluent Limitations Guidelines (ELG) and standards for steam electric power plants that focus on the reduction of metals and other pollutants in wastewater from new and existing power plants.

With the closure of the wet pond system in 2023 (as described in further detail in the CCR section below), Columbia complies with ELG requirements. With the installation of additional wastewater treatment equipment completed in 2023, the Elm Road Units comply with ELG requirements.

In May 2024, the EPA finalized the ELG rule that further regulates the wastewater discharges associated with coal-fired power plants. The rule focuses on wastewater discharges from flue gas desulfurization, combustion residual leachate, and bottom ash transport water. The rule includes reduced requirements for plants that have already installed pollution controls based on previous versions of the rule, and for plants that will be retiring or switching to natural gas by certain dates. Due to the installation of pollution control prevention equipment under previous versions of the rule and the planned fuel switching to natural gas, MGE believes it is likely the Elm Road Units will qualify for these reduced requirements. MGE and the operator of the Elm Road Units are evaluating operational options for Elm Road to be consistent with the requirements of the rule.

Cooling Water Intake Rules (Section 316(b))
The EPA's cooling water intake rules requires that cooling water intake structures at electric power plants meet best technology available (BTA) standards to reduce the mortality from entrainment (drawing aquatic life into a plant's cooling system) and impingement (trapping aquatic life on screens of cooling water intake structures).

Blount received its most recent WPDES permit from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) in October 2023. Blount's latest WPDES permit assumes that the plant meets BTA standards for entrainment for the duration of this permit which expires in 2028. The WDNR included a requirement to conduct an optimization study to demonstrate compliance with impingement BTA standards in the latest permit which needs to be completed by January 2028. Once the WDNR determines the impingement requirements at Blount, MGE will be able to determine any compliance costs of meeting Blount's permit requirements.

Intakes at Columbia are subject to this rule. The Columbia operator timely submitted its renewal application. BTA improvements required by the renewal permit will be coordinated with the owners' plan to retire both units by the end of 2029. MGE will continue to work with Columbia's operator to evaluate regulatory requirements in light of the planned retirement. MGE does not expect this rule to have a material effect on Columbia.

Air Quality
Federal and state air quality regulations impose restrictions on various emissions, including emissions of particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO
2
), nitrogen oxides (NO
x
), and other pollutants, and require permits for operation of emission sources. These permits have been obtained by MGE and must be renewed periodically. Current EPA initiatives under the Clean Air Act, including the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), have the potential to result in additional operating and capital expenditure costs for MGE.

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Reduction Guidelines under the Clean Air Act 111(d) Rule
The Clean Air Act sets new source performance standards and emission guidelines for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units. These regulations apply to existing, new, and modified units and guide states in developing their emission control plans.

In May 2024, the EPA published its final performance standards and emission guidelines under section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act for carbon dioxide emissions from new combustion turbines and existing fossil-fuel fired boilers used to produce electricity. The final rule grants some emissions flexibility for existing coal-fired units that retire and/or fuel switch by certain dates. For existing natural gas boiler units, the final rule establishes a process where states must submit plans to the EPA for establishing standards. States will have two years from the publication date of these rules to submit plans to the EPA for review and approval. The EPA has indicated that it is separately developing performance standards and emission guidelines for GHG emissions from existing natural gas-fired combustion turbines. Preliminary evaluation of

87

the final rule shows that MGE meets the requirements for the gas-fired boilers at Blount. Furthermore, MGE will meet the requirements for the coal-fired units at Columbia through planned unit retirements and the Elm Road Units through its transition to natural gas. MGE will monitor for upcoming rulemaking planned for gas-fired combustion turbines.

National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and Related Rules
The EPA's NAAQS regulations have been developed to set allowable ambient levels of six pollutants to protect sensitive human populations (primary NAAQS) and the environment (secondary NAAQS) from the negative effects of exposure to these pollutants. The Clean Air Act requires that the EPA periodically review, and adjust as necessary, the NAAQS for these six air pollutants. The EPA's NAAQS review can result in a lowering of the allowed ambient levels of a pollutant, a change in how the pollutant is monitored, and/or a change in which sources of that pollutant are regulated. States implement any necessary monitoring and measurement changes and recommend areas for attainment (meets the ambient requirements) or nonattainment (does not meet these standards). The EPA makes final attainment and nonattainment determinations. States must come up with a State Implementation Plan (SIP) to get nonattainment areas into attainment and maintain air quality in attainment areas Stationary sources of air emissions located in a nonattainment area will be most affected and may be subject to additional data submission and emission measurement requirements during permitting renewals, new emission limitations set by the SIP (which could result in significant capital expenditures), and additional expenses and/or permitting burdens for expanding existing facilities or building new facilities. The process, which starts with determining acceptable primary and/or secondary NAAQS and ends with executing SIPs can take years. Since the NAAQS regulations have the potential to affect both existing and new facilities, MGE continuously monitors changes to these rules to evaluate whether changes could impact its operations. In addition, the EPA has adopted interstate transport rules, such as CSAPR, to address contributions to NAAQS nonattainment from upwind sources in neighboring states. In the following paragraphs we discuss specific NAAQS and transport rule developments that may affect MGE.

Ozone NAAQS
The Elm Road Units are located in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, a nonattainment area for the 2015 Ozone NAAQS. At this time, the operator of the Elm Road Units does not expect that the 2015 Ozone NAAQS or the Milwaukee County nonattainment designation will have a direct material effect on the Elm Road Units.

Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) NAAQS
In March 2024, the EPA published a final rule to lower the average annual PM2.5 NAAQS from 12 ug/m3 to 9 ug/m3, effective May 2024. The new annual PM2.5 NAAQS could impact Milwaukee County, where the Elm Road units are located, if the county is determined to be in nonattainment. A nonattainment designation would require the State of Wisconsin to develop a plan to get into attainment, which would likely include additional limitations for new and modified plants in the county.

The final impact of this rule will not be known until PM data from 2023 and 2024 is evaluated and approved, the EPA determines the attainment status of Wisconsin counties, and the State of Wisconsin develops an attainment implementation plan. MGE will continue to follow the rule's developments.

Rules regulating nitrogen oxide (NO
x
) and sulfur dioxide (SO
2
) emissions, including the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) and Clean Air Visibility Rule

The EPA's CSAPR and its progeny are a suite of interstate air pollution transport rules designed to reduce ozone and PM2.5 ambient air levels in areas that the EPA has determined as being significantly impacted by pollution from upwind states. This is accomplished through a reduction in NO
x
 and SO
2
 from qualifying fossil-fuel fired power plants and industrial boilers in upwind "contributing" states. NO
x
 and SO
2
 contribute to fine particulate pollution and NO
x
 contributes to ozone formation in downwind areas. Reductions are generally achieved through a cap-and-trade system. Individual plants can meet their caps through reducing emissions and/or buying allowances on the market.

In March 2023 (published June 2023), the EPA finalized its Federal Implementation Plan to address state obligations under the Clean Air Act "good neighbor" provisions for the 2015 Ozone NAAQS (FIP Rule). The FIP Rule impacts 23 states, including Wisconsin. For Wisconsin, the FIP Rule includes revisions to the current obligations for fossil-fuel power generation, which includes Blount, Columbia, the Elm Road Units, WCCF, West Riverside, and West Marinette. Emissions budgets can be met with planned retirements, fuel switching, and immediately available measures, including consistently operating emissions controls already installed at power plants. In 2026, additional obligations would go into effect, including a further reduction in emissions budgets. Wisconsin would need to submit a SIP to meet its obligations or accept the EPA's FIP Rule. Legal challenges to the FIP Rule are pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the

88

District of Columbia. In June 2024, the Supreme Court of the United States granted a request to stay the FIP Rule and block its enforcement pending judicial review by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on the merits of petitioner's challenges to implementation of the rule. The EPA has temporarily halted the enforcement of the Good Neighbor Plan's requirements for all pollution sources in states affected by the plan, including Wisconsin. This action follows legal challenges to the plan. While the EPA addresses these concerns, interim rules have been implemented. In Wisconsin, these interim rules aim to ensure that obligations to address interstate ozone pollution with respect to the 2008 ozone NAAQS under the CSAPR Update Rule continue to be met, even though the Good Neighbor Plan is temporarily suspended. Based on our current evaluation, if the FIP goes into effect as-is, the 2026 additional emission reductions may impact the Elm Road Units, however, final impact of the rules will not be known until judicial reviews are completed and/or the EPA takes further action regarding the rule.

Clean Air Visibility Rule
Columbia is subject to the best available retrofit technology (BART) regulations, a subsection of Clean Air Visibility Rule, which may require pollution control retrofits. Columbia's existing pollution control upgrades, and the EPA's stance that compliance with the CSAPR satisfies the requirements of BART, should mean that Columbia will not need to do additional work to meet BART requirements. Wisconsin's 2021 SIP argues that Wisconsin will meet its current regional haze goals based on expected emissions reductions, which include the planned Columbia unit retirements. Given that the Wisconsin SIP recognizes the Columbia unit retirements as part of its emission reduction plan, MGE does not anticipate further obligations with respect to this rule at Columbia. MGE will continue to monitor legal developments and any future updates to this rule.

Solid Waste

Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) Rule
The CCR rule regulates the disposal of solid waste coal ash and defines what ash use activities would be considered generally exempt beneficial reuse of coal ash. The CCR rule also regulates landfills, ash ponds, and other surface impoundments used for coal combustion residuals by regulating their design, location, monitoring, and operation. The CCR rule requires owners and operators of coal-fired power plants to stop transporting CCR and non-CCR wastewater to unlined surface impoundments. At Columbia, the coal combustion residuals system completed in 2023 replaced the unlined surface impoundment, and Columbia complies with this rule.

Review of the Elm Road Units has indicated that the costs to comply with the CCR rule are not expected to be significant.

In May 2024, the EPA published its final CCR Legacy Rule. The CCR Legacy Rule applies to previous closed disposal sites. In 2024, MGE recorded an asset retirement obligation for its estimated share of the legal liability associated with the effect of the CCR Legacy Rule for remediation and groundwater compliance monitoring. Actual costs of compliance may be different than the amount recorded due to potential changes in compliance strategies that will be used, as well as other potential changes in cost estimate. See 
Footnote 17
 for further information on asset retirement obligations.

b.
Legal Matters - 
MGE Energy and MGE.

MGE is involved in various legal matters that are being defended and handled in the ordinary course of business. MGE accrues for costs that are probable of being incurred and subject to reasonable estimation. The accrued amount for these matters is not material to the financial statements. MGE does not expect the resolution of these matters to have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.

Several environmental groups filed petitions against the PSCW challenging the fixed customer charge set in MGE's 2022/2023 rate settlement, 2023 electric limited reopener, and 2024/2025 rate order. MGE has intervened in the petitions in cooperation with the PSCW. See 
Footnote 9.a.
 for more information regarding this matter.

c.
Purchase Co
ntracts - MGE Energy and MGE.

MGE Energy and MGE have entered into various commodity supply, transportation, and storage contracts to meet their obligations to deliver electricity and natural gas to customers. Management expects to recover these costs in future customer rates.

Asset Retirement Obliga
tions - MGE Energy and MGE.

MGE recorded an obligation for the fair value of its legal liability for asset retirement obligations (AROs) associated with removal of the West Campus Cogeneration Facility and the Elm Road Units, electric substations, combustion turbine generating units, wind generating facilities, and solar generating facilities, all of which are located on property not owned and would need to be removed upon the ultimate end of the associated leases. The significant conditional AROs identified by MGE included the costs of abandoning in place gas services and mains, the abatement and disposal of equipment and buildings contaminated with asbestos and PCBs, and the proper disposal and removal of tanks, batteries, and underground cable. Changes in management's assumptions regarding settlement dates, settlement methods, or assigned probabilities could have a material effect on the liabilities and the associated regulatory asset recorded as of December 31, 2024.

MGE also may have AROs relating to the removal of various assets, such as certain electric and gas distribution facilities. These facilities are generally located on property owned by third parties, on which MGE is permitted to operate by lease, permit, easement, license, or service agreement. The asset retirement obligations associated with these facilities cannot be reasonably determined due to the indeterminate life of the related agreements.

Derivative and Hedging 
Instruments - MGE Energy and MGE.

a.
Purpose.

As part of its regular operations, MGE enters into contracts, including options, swaps, futures, forwards, and other contractual commitments, to manage its exposure to commodity prices. To the extent that these contracts are derivatives, MGE assesses whether or not the normal purchases or normal sales exclusion applies. For contracts to which this exclusion cannot be applied, the derivatives are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. MGE's financial commodity derivative activities are conducted in accordance with its electric and gas risk management program, which is approved by the PSCW and limits the volume MGE can hedge with specific risk management strategies. The maximum length of time over which cash flows related to energy commodities can be hedged is 
four
 years. If the derivative qualifies for regulatory deferral, the derivatives are marked to fair value and are offset with a corresponding regulatory asset or liability depending on whether the derivative is in a net loss or net gain position, respectively. The deferred gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the delivery month applicable to the instrument. Gains and losses related to hedges qualifying for regulatory treatment are refundable or recoverable in gas rates through the Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) or in electric rates as a component of the fuel rules mechanism.

Financial Statement Presentation.

MGE purchases and sells exchange-traded and over-the-counter options, swaps, and future contracts. These arrangements are primarily entered into to help stabilize the price risk associated with gas or power purchases. These transactions are employed by both MGE's gas and electric segments. Additionally, as a result of the firm transmission agreements that MGE holds on electricity transmission paths in the MISO market,

MGE holds

financial transmission rights (FTRs). An FTR is a financial instrument that entitles the holder to a stream of revenues or charges based on the differences in hourly day-ahead energy prices between two points on the transmission grid. The fair values of these instruments are offset with a corresponding regulatory asset/liability depending on whether the instruments are in a net loss/gain position. Depending on the nature of the instrument, the gain or loss associated with these transactions will be reflected as cost of gas sold, fuel for electric generation, or purchased power expense in the delivery month applicable to the instrument. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of exchange traded derivatives and FTRs exceeded their cost basis by $
0.1
 million. As of December 31, 2023, the cost basis of exchange traded derivatives and FTRs exceeded their fair value by $
5.2
 million.

The following table summarizes the fair value of the derivative instruments on the consolidated balance sheets. 
All 
derivative instruments in this table are presented on a gross basis and are calculated prior to the netting of instruments with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement as well as the netting of collateral. For financial statement

purposes, 
instruments are netted with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement as well as the netting of collateral.

MGE's commodity derivative contracts and FTRs are subject to regulatory deferral. These derivatives are marked to fair value and are offset with a corresponding regulatory asset or liability. Realized gains and losses are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are recognized in earnings in the delivery month applicable to the instrument. As a result of the treatment described above, there are no unrealized gains or losses that flow through earnings.

Certain counterparties extend MGE a credit limit. If MGE exceeds these limits, the counterparties may require collateral to be posted. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023
, 
no
 counterparties were in a net liability position.

Nonperformance of counterparties to the non-exchange traded derivatives could expose MGE to credit loss. However, MGE enters into transactions only with companies that meet or exceed strict credit guidelines, and it monitors these counterparties on an ongoing basis to mitigate nonperformance risk in its portfolio. As of December 31, 2024
, 
no
 counterparties had defaulted.

Fair Value of Financial Instru
ments - MGE Energy and MGE.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The accounting standard clarifies that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk. The standard also establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of the assumptions used and requires the use of observable market data when available. The levels are:

Level 1 - Pricing inputs are quoted prices within active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 - Pricing inputs are quoted prices within active markets for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations that are correlated with or otherwise verifiable by observable market data.

Level 3 - Pricing inputs are unobservable and reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
a.
Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities Recorded at the Carrying Amount.

The carrying amount of cash, cash equivalents, and outstanding commercial paper approximates fair market value due to the short maturity of those investments and obligations. The estimated fair market value of long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for similar financial instruments. Since long-term debt is not traded in an active market, it is classified as Level 2.

The estimated fair market value of financial instruments are as follows:

As of 
December 31, 2024, and 2023, collateral of less than $
0.1
 million and $
5.4
 million, respectively, was posted against and netted with derivative liability positions on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the derivative liability disclosed in this table has not been reduced for the collateral posted.

Exchange-traded Investments.

Investments include exchange-traded investment securities valued using quoted prices on active exchanges and are therefore classified as Level 1.

Deferred Compensation.
 The deferred compensation plans allow participants to defer certain cash compensation into notional investment accounts. These amounts are included within "Other deferred liabilities and other" in the consolidated balance sheets. The value of certain deferred compensation obligations is based on the market value of the participants' notional investment accounts. The underlying notional investments are comprised primarily of equities, mutual funds, and fixed income securities that are based on directly and indirectly observable market prices. Since the deferred compensation obligations themselves are not exchanged in an active market, they are classified as Level 2.

The value of legacy deferred compensation obligations is based on notional investments that earn interest based upon the semiannual rate of U.S. Treasury Bills having a 
26
-week maturity increased by 
1
% 
compounded monthly with a

94

minimum 
annual rate of 
7
%, compounded monthly. The notional investments are based upon observable market data, however, since the deferred compensation obligations themselves are not exchanged in an active market, they are classified as Level 2.

Derivatives.
 Derivatives include exchange-traded derivative contracts, over-the-counter transactions, a purchased power agreement, and FTRs. Most exchange-traded derivative contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are therefore classified as Level 1. A small number of exchange-traded derivative contracts are valued using quoted market pricing in markets with insufficient volumes and are therefore considered unobservable and classified as Level 3. Transactions done with an over-the-counter party are on inactive markets and are therefore classified as Level 3. These transactions are valued based on quoted prices from markets with similar exchange-traded transactions. FTRs are priced based upon monthly auction results for identical or similar instruments in a closed market with limited data available and are therefore classified as Level 3.

The purchased power agreement, with a term ended May 2022, was valued using an internal pricing model and therefore was classified as Level 3. See the

2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K
 for details on the internal pricing model and significant unobservable inputs.

Performance Obligations

A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of contracts have a single performance obligation.

Retail Revenue (Residential, Commercial, Industrial, and Other Retail/Municipal)
Providing electric and gas utility service to retail customers represents MGE's core business activity. Tariffs are approved by the PSCW through a rate order and provide MGE's customers with the standard terms and conditions, including pricing terms. The performance obligation to deliver electricity or gas is satisfied over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the commodities provided by MGE. MGE recognizes revenues as the commodity is delivered to customers. Meters are read on a systematic basis throughout the month based on established meter-reading schedules and customers are subsequently billed for services received. At the end of the month, MGE accrues an estimate for unbilled commodities delivered to customers. The unbilled revenue estimate is based on daily system demand volumes, weather factors, estimated line losses, estimated customer usage by class, and applicable customer rates.

Utility Cost Recovery Mechanisms
MGE's tariff rates include a provision for fuel cost recovery. Over-collection of fuel-related costs that are outside the approved range will be recognized as a reduction of revenue. Under-collection of these costs will be recognized in "Purchased power" expense in the consolidated statements of income. The cumulative effects of these deferred amounts will be recorded in "Regulatory assets" or "Regulatory liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets until they are reflected in future billings to customers. See 
Footnote 9.b.
 for further information.

MGE also has other cost recovery mechanisms. For example, any over-collection of the difference between actual costs incurred and the amount of costs collected from customers is recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period incurred.

Sales to the Market
Sales to the market include energy charges, capacity or demand charges, and ancillary charges represented by wholesale sales of electricity made to third parties who are not ultimate users of the electricity. Most of these sales are spot market transactions on the markets operated by MISO. Each transaction is considered a performance obligation and revenue is recognized in the period in which energy charges, capacity or demand charges, and ancillary services are sold into MISO. MGE reports, on a net basis, transactions on the MISO markets in which it buys and sells power within the same hour to meet electric energy delivery requirements.

96

Transportation of Gas
MGE has contracts under which it provides gas transportation services to customers who have elected to purchase gas from a third party. MGE delivers this gas via pipelines within its service territory. Revenue is recognized as service is rendered or gas is delivered to customers. Tariffs are approved by the PSCW through a rate order and provide gas transportation customers with standard terms and conditions, including pricing terms.

22.
Segment Inform
ation - MGE Energy and MGE.

The electric utility business purchases, generates and distributes electricity, and contracts for transmission service. The gas utility business purchases and distributes natural gas and contracts for the transportation of natural gas. Both the electric and gas segments operate through MGE Energy's principal subsidiary, MGE.

The nonregulated energy operations are conducted through MGE Energy's subsidiaries: MGE Power, MGE Power Elm Road, and MGE Power West Campus. These subsidiaries own electric generating capacity that they lease to MGE to assist MGE. MGE Power Elm Road has an ownership interest in two coal-fired generating units in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, which are leased to MGE, and MGE Power West Campus owns a controlling interest in the electric generation plant of a natural gas-fired cogeneration facility on the UW campus. MGE Power West Campus's portion is also leased to MGE.

The transmission investment segment invests in ATC, a company that provides electric transmission services primarily in Wisconsin, and ATC Holdco, a company formed to pursue electric transmission development and investments outside of Wisconsin. These investments are held in MGE Transco and MGEE Transco, respectively. See 
Footnote 7
 for further discussion.

The "All Other" segment includes: corporate, CWDC, MAGAEL, MGE State Energy Services, MGE Services, and North Mendota. These entities' operations consist of investing in companies and property which relate to the regulated operations, and financing the regulated operations.

General corporate expenses include the cost of executive management, corporate accounting and finance, information technology, risk management, human resources and legal functions, and employee benefits that are allocated to electric and gas segments based on formulas prescribed by the PSCW. Identifiable assets are those used in MGE's operations in each segment.

Sales between our electric and gas segments are based on PSCW approved tariffed rates. Additionally, intersegment operations related to the leasing arrangement between our electric segment and MGE Power Elm Road/MGE Power West Campus are based on terms previously approved by the PSCW. Consistent with internal reporting, management has presented the direct financing capital leases between MGE and MGE Power Elm Road/MGE Power West Campus based on actual lease payments included in rates. Lease payments made by MGE to MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West Campus are shown as operating expenses. The lease payments received by MGE Power Elm Road and MGE Power West

97

Campus from MGE are shown as lease income in interdepartmental revenues. The depreciation expense associated with the Elm Road Units and WCCF is reflected in the nonregulated energy segment.

The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), utilizes various reported measures of segment profit or loss to assess performance and allocate resources within the organization. Key metrics such as segment revenue, expenses, capital expenditures, and net income provide the CODM with valuable insights into each segment's financial health and operational efficiency. For instance, segment revenue helps gauge market performance and sales effectiveness, while net income reveals the profitability of core operations by accounting for both direct and indirect costs. By analyzing these measures, the CODM can identify high-performing segments that warrant increased investment, reallocate resources from underperforming areas, and implement strategic changes to optimize overall performance. This targeted approach ensures that resources are directed toward segments with the greatest potential for growth and profitability, aligning with the organization's broader strategic objectives.

Fuel and Purchase Power and Purchase Gas Costs are significant segment expenses as defined in Segment Reporting. The CODM does not review disaggregated assets on a segment basis; therefore, such information is not presented.

MGE Energy and MGE

Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

During the fourth quarter of 2024, each registrant's management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated its disclosure controls and procedures related to the recording, processing, summarization, and reporting of information in its periodic reports that it files with the SEC. These disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to ensure that material information relating to that registrant, including its subsidiaries, is accumulated and made known to that registrant's management, including these officers, by other employees of that registrant and its subsidiaries as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and that this information is recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated, and reported, as applicable, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. The evaluations take into account changes in the internal and external operating environments that may impact those controls and procedures. Due to the inherent limitations of control systems, not all misstatements may be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. Also, MGE Energy does not control or manage certain of its unconsolidated entities and thus, its access and ability to apply its procedures to those entities is more limited than is the case for its consolidated subsidiaries.

As of December 31, 2024, each registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Each registrant intends to strive continually to improve its disclosure controls and procedures to enhance the quality of its financial reporting.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, there were no changes in either registrant's internal controls over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect materially, that registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

MGE Energy and MGE

Management of MGE Energy and MGE are required to assess and report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. As a result of that assessment, management determined that there were no material weaknesses as of December 31, 2024 and, therefore, concluded that MGE Energy and MGE's internal control over financial reporting was effective. Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is included in 
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
 of this Report.
