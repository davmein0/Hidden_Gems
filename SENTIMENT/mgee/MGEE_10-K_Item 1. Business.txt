(b)
Audit-Related Fees for 2024 and 2023 include professional services rendered in connection with utility commission-mandated obligations.

MGE is a wholly owned subsidiary of MGE Energy and does not have a separate audit committee. Instead, that function is fulfilled for MGE by the MGE Energy Audit Committee. The Audit Committee approves each engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm to render any audit or nonaudit services before the firm is engaged to render those services. The Chair of the Audit Committee or other designated Audit Committee member may represent the entire Audit Committee for purposes of this approval. Any services approved by the Chair or other designated Audit Committee members are reported to the full Audit Committee at the next scheduled Audit Committee meeting. No de minimis exceptions to this approval process are allowed under the Audit Committee Charter; and thus, none of the services described in the preceding table were approved pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X.

Dividend Restrictions
Dividend payments by MGE to MGE Energy are subject to restrictions arising under a PSCW rate order and, to a lesser degree, MGE's first mortgage bonds. The PSCW order restricts any dividends that MGE may pay MGE Energy if its common equity ratio, calculated in the manner used in the rate proceeding, is less than 
55
%. MGE's thirteen month rolling average common equity ratio as of 
December 31, 2024, is 
57.6
% as determined under the calculation used in the rate proceeding. This restriction did not impact MGE's payment of dividends in 2024. Cash dividends of $
34.5
 million and $
41.0
 million were paid by MGE to MGE Energy in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The rate proceeding calculation includes as indebtedness imputed amounts for MGE's outstanding purchase power capacity payments and other PSCW adjustments, but does not include the indebtedness associated with MGE Power Elm Road or MGE Power West Campus, which are consolidated into MGE's financial statements but are not direct obligations of MGE.

MGE has covenanted with the holders of its first mortgage bonds not to declare or pay any dividend or make any other distribution on or purchase any shares of its common stock unless, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of all such dividends and distributions and all amounts applied to such purchases, after December 31, 1945, shall not exceed the earned surplus (retained earnings) accumulated subsequent to December 31, 1945. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $
754.6
 million was available for the payment of dividends under this covenant.
See 
Footnotes 13
 and 
14
 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Report for more information on dividend restrictions appearing in credit agreements and long-term debt, respectively.
