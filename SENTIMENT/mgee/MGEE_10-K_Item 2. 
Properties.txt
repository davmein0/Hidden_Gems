(a)
Net summer rated capacity is determined by annual testing (measured in June, July or August) and may vary from year to year due to, among other things, the operating and physical conditions of the units.

(b)
All facilities shown are owned by MGE unless footnoted otherwise.

(c)
MGE jointly owns these facilities with various other utilities. The capacity shown represents MGE's ownership share:

•
Columbia is jointly-owned by MGE, WPSC and WPL, which operates the facility. MGE's ownership interest is 19%. See "Columbia" below for further information.

•
Elm Road Units is jointly owned by MGE, WPPI Energy, Inc, and WEC, which operates the units. MGE's ownership interest is 8.33%. See "Elm Road Units" below for further information.

•
WCCF is jointly-owned by MGE and UW-Madison. Per the joint plant agreement, the UW is allocated 17 MW of the net capability of these units during the summer cooling season. The net summer-rated capacity shown reflects this decrease. MGE's ownership interest is 55%. See "WCCF" below for further information. 

•
West Riverside is jointly owned by multiple parties including MGE and WPL, which operates the facility. Power from this facility is shared in proportion to each owner's ownership interest. Commercial operation date of facility was 2020. MGE purchased its ownership interest of 6.9% in 2023 and 2024. 

•
Forward is jointly owned by MGE, WPSC and WPL, which operates the facility. Power from this facility is shared in proportion to each owner's ownership interest. Commercial operation date of facility was 2008. MGE purchased its 12.8% ownership interest in 2018. 

•
Red Barn is jointly owned by MGE and WPSC, which operates the facility. MGE's ownership interest is 10%.

•
Two Creeks and Badger Hollow I and II are both jointly owned with WPSC, which operates the facilities. MGE's ownership interest is 33%.

•
Paris is jointly owned by MGE, WPSC and WE Energies, which operates the facility. MGE's ownership interest is 10%. 

(d)
ULSFO is ultra low-sulfur fuel oil.

Columbia

MGE and two other utilities jointly own Columbia, a coal-fired generating facility consisting of two units, which, as of December 31, 2024, accounted for 22% of MGE's net summer rated capacity. Power from this facility is shared in proportion to each owner's ownership interest. As of December 31, 2024, MGE had a 19% ownership interest in Columbia. The other owners are WPL, which operates Columbia, and WPSC. MGE and the other co-owners announced plans to retire Columbia. The co-owners intend to retire Unit 1 and Unit 2 by the end of 2029. Final timing and unit retirement dates are subject to change depending on operational, regulatory, capacity needs, and other factors impacting one or more of the Columbia co-owners.

The Columbia units burn low-sulfur sub-bituminous coal obtained from the Powder River Basin coal fields located in Wyoming. The coal inventory supply for the Columbia units was approximately 90 days as of December 31, 2023, and approximately 87 days as of December 31, 2024.

Elm Road Units and WCCF

MGE Power Elm Road and two other utilities own undivided interests in the Elm Road Units, consisting of two units, which, as of December 31, 2024, accounted for 11% of MGE's net summer rated capacity. Power from these units is shared in proportion to each owner's ownership interest. MGE Power Elm Road owns an 8.33% ownership interest in the Elm Road Units, and its interest in the Elm Road Units is leased to MGE. The other owners are Wisconsin Energy Corporation, which operates the units, and WPPI Energy, Inc. The Elm Road Units burn bituminous coal obtained from northern West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania, and sub-bituminous coal from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. MGE's share of the coal inventory supply for the Elm Road Units was approximately 82 days as of December 31, 2023, and approximately 59 days as of December 31, 2024. MGE Power Elm Road's share of the Elm Road Units is reflected in "Property, plant, and equipment, net" on MGE Energy's and MGE's consolidated balance sheets. In 2021, MGE announced plans to end the use of coal as a primary fuel at the Elm Road Units and transition the plant to natural gas. By the end of 2030, MGE expects coal to be used only as a backup fuel at the Elm Road Units. This transition would help MGE meet its 2030 carbon reduction goals. By the end of 2032, MGE expects that the Elm Road Units will be fully transitioned away from coal, which would eliminate coal as an internal generation source for MGE.

MGE Power West Campus and the UW jointly own undivided interests in a natural gas-fired cogeneration facility on the UW campus. The facility has the capacity to produce 30,000 tons of chilled water, 500,000 pounds per hour of steam, and approximately 150 MW of electricity. The UW owns 45% of the facility, which represents its interest in the chilled-water and steam assets. These assets are used to meet a part of the UW's need for air-conditioning and steam-heat capacity. MGE Power West Campus owns 55% of the facility, which represents its interest in the electric generating assets. These assets are used to provide electricity to MGE's customers. The UW's share of the plant and portion of the earnings from the WCCF are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements of MGE Energy or MGE. MGE Power West Campus's share of the plant is reflected in "Property, plant, and equipment, net" on MGE Energy's and MGE's consolidated balance sheets.

MGE leases MGE Power Elm Road's ownership interest in the Elm Road Units pursuant to two separate facility leases. MGE leases the electric generating assets owned by MGE Power West Campus and is responsible for operating the entire facility. At the end of the respective lease terms, MGE may, at its option, renew the facility lease for an additional term, purchase the leased ownership interest at fair market value, or allow the lease to end. The financial terms of the facility lease agreements are as follows:

Electric and Gas Distribution Facilities

As of December 31, 2024, MGE owned 825 miles of overhead electric distribution line and 1,359 miles of underground electric distribution cable, all of which are located in Wisconsin. These electric distribution facilities are connected by 48 substations, installed with a capacity of 1.2 million kVA. MGE's gas facilities include 3,092 miles of distribution mains, which are all owned by MGE.

A significant portion of MGE's electric and gas distribution facilities are located above or underneath highways, streets, other public places, or property otherwise not owned by MGE. MGE believes that it has satisfactory rights to use those places or property in the form of permits, grants, easements, and licenses; however, it has not necessarily undertaken to examine the underlying title to the land upon which the rights rest.

Encumbrances

The principal plants and properties of MGE are subject to a lien related to its Indenture of Mortgage and Deed of Trust dated as of January 1, 1946, as amended and supplemented, under which MGE's first mortgage bonds are issued. MGE Power Elm Road has collaterally assigned its right to lease payments from MGE for the Elm Road Units in order to secure the repayment of the senior secured notes issued by MGE Power Elm Road. MGE Power West Campus has collaterally assigned its right to lease payments from MGE for the WCCF in order to secure the repayment of the senior secured notes issued by MGE Power West Campus. See 
Footnote 14
 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for additional information regarding these first mortgage bonds and the entitlement of certain senior notes issued by MGE to be equally and ratably secured if MGE issues additional first mortgage bonds.
