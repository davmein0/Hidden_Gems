BUSINESS
Overview
We are a deep-sea minerals exploration company focused on the collection, processing and refining of polymetallic nodules found on the seafloor in international waters of the Clarion Clipperton Zone (“CCZ”), approximately 1,500 miles (or 2,400 kilometers) south-west of San Diego, California. The CCZ is a geological submarine fracture zone of abyssal plains and other formations in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, with a length of around 7,240 kilometers (4,500 miles) that spans approximately 4,500,000 square kilometers (1,737,000 square miles). Polymetallic nodules are discrete rocks that sit unattached to the seafloor, occur in significant quantities in the CCZ and have high concentrations of nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese in a single rock.
We believe these four metals contained in the polymetallic nodules are critical for energy infrastructure and industrial manufacturing. Our resource definition work to date shows that nodules in our contract areas represent the world’s largest estimated undeveloped resource of these critical metals. If we are able to collect polymetallic nodules from the seafloor on a commercial scale, we plan to use such nodules to produce three types of metal products: (i) feedstock for battery cathode precursors (nickel and cobalt sulfates, or intermediary nickel-copper-cobalt matte, or nickel-copper-cobalt alloy) for electric vehicles (“EV”) and energy storage markets, (ii) copper cathode for EV wiring, energy transmission and other applications, and (iii) manganese silicate for manganese alloy production required for steel production. Our mission is to build a carefully managed, shared stock of metal (a “metal commons”) that can be used, recovered and reused for generations to come. Significant quantities of newly mined metal are required because existing metal stocks are insufficient to meet rising demand.
Exploration and exploitation of seabed minerals in international waters is regulated by the International Seabed Authority (“ISA”), an intergovernmental organization established pursuant to the 1994 Agreement Relating to the Implementation of UNCLOS. The ISA grants contracts to sovereign states or to private contractors who are sponsored by a sovereign state. The ISA requires that a contractor obtain and maintain sponsorship by a host nation that is a member of the ISA and signatory to UNCLOS, and such nation must maintain effective supervision and regulatory control over such sponsored contractor. The ISA has issued a total of 19 polymetallic nodule exploration contracts covering approximately 1.28 million square kilometers, or 0.4% of the global seafloor, 17 of which are in the CCZ. We hold exclusive exploration and commercial rights to two of the 17 polymetallic nodule contract areas in the CCZ through our subsidiaries Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. (“NORI”) and Tonga Offshore Mining Limited (“TOML”), sponsored by the Republic of Nauru (“Nauru”) and the Kingdom of Tonga (“Tonga”), respectively. We are also in the initial stages of considering the possibility of a U.S.-based regulatory pathway with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”) and the U.S. Department of Commerce under the U.S. Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act (“DSHMRA”) for the commercial production of deep-sea polymetallic nodules in the CCZ.
We are still in the exploration phase and have not yet obtained any exploitation contracts from the ISA to commence commercial-scale polymetallic nodule collection in the CCZ. Additionally, we do not have the applicable environmental and/or other permits required to build and operate commercial-scale polymetallic nodule processing and refining plants on land.
Polymetallic Nodules
Deep-sea polymetallic nodules form on and just below the sediment-covered seafloor of the abyssal plains. These nodules contain significant amounts of metals, and their unique characteristic compared to terrestrial deposits is the presence of the four critical metals, nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese, in one deposit.

​
The above characteristics of polymetallic nodules may provide an opportunity to compress lifecycle environmental and social impacts of producing the critical metals contained in nodules as compared to land ores. In order to extract nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese from land ores, at least three different types of ores would need to be excavated. Mine development often involves social displacement and impacts on Indigenous people as well as deforestation, destruction of carbon sinks and biodiversity loss. In addition, several times more mass would need to be processed, often requiring significant amounts of local water resources; mining and processing tailings which can be toxic and need to be managed indefinitely in tailings dams, using dry-stacking or a practice known as deep-sea tailings placement (DSTP). Furthermore, metal production from land ores can release several toxic streams into the surrounding environment which can negatively impact the health of local communities and ecosystems. We believe using nodules to produce the critical metals contained therein can help reduce several of these impacts associated with mining land ores. If our nodules are to be processed and refined in the United States (“U.S.”), we can also compress the current supply chain that some materials need to travel before reaching the U.S. from 50,000 miles down to 1,500 miles, while reducing dependency on China which dominates refining for critical metals such as nickel, cobalt and manganese.
Market Opportunity
Three of the four minerals contained in polymetallic nodules (nickel, copper and cobalt) are classified as critical in the world’s leading economies, meaning they are both essential to the country’s welfare and face considerable supply chain vulnerabilities. We also believe that manganese is critical for energy infrastructure and industrial manufacturing. Mining and, to a greater extent, processing of these metals are concentrated in or controlled by China. China is the largest producer of refined manganese, cobalt, and copper; while China is the second largest producer of refined nickel, it has substantial control of nickel processing in Indonesia, today’s leading global nickel supplier. An array of policies and agreements have been initiated in 2025 by the U.S. Government to combat critical mineral concentration including an executive order establishing a national energy emergency inclusive of mineral development and processing, plans to expedite mining and processing permitting, a variety of critical mineral agreements abroad, plans to locate metal refining on military bases, and an increase on tariffs for imported Chinese goods.
Given the wide range of environmental and social impacts associated with conventional land-based mining, we believe it is important to ensure that these large amounts of critical metals contained in nodules are sourced with the lowest environmental, social, and economic impacts possible. As the global supply of high-grade ore remains limited and metal demand increases, we can expect a larger environmental and social footprint, potential supply shortages and volatility in metal prices should land ores remain the only viable source of the critical metals contained in nodules.
Industries which represent end-use segments that require the critical metals contained in nodules are of particular interest to us and represent potential market opportunities. Nodules contain metals that can be employed for: (i) infrastructure (nickel, cobalt and manganese alloys for steel, jet engines and turbines), copper cables and wiring for power generation and transmission, and electronics), (ii) energy storage (battery cathode precursors in the form of nickel, manganese and cobalt sulfates, or intermediary nickel-copper-cobalt matte, or nickel-copper-cobalt alloy) and copper cathode for wiring) and (iii) chemicals (cobalt and manganese catalysts for fuel refining, manganese sulfate for fertilizer). We believe the transition to more diversified supply chains for the critical metals contained in nodules, continued urbanization of developing economies and continued growth of energy systems and EVs will test the limits of the current

supply of certain metals. See the section entitled 
“Our Competitive Advantages”.
 Manganese is used in nearly every steel manufactured process - there were 1.9 billion tonnes of steel manufactured in 2024. Both manganese and nickel are used in the manufacturing of stainless steel and high-performance specialty steels essential for maritime, aerospace and chemical uses. Steel demand is projected to rise 30% by 2050. Besides China, most regions particularly India, Africa and South-East Asia, will see an increase in demand. While end-uses driven by the energy transition represent a small fraction of the total use of the four metals contained in polymetallic nodules today, we believe that the relative use of these four metals by EVs and other energy transition systems is set to increase significantly over the next decades.

The below charts published by the International Energy Agency show increasing global demand by end-use application for nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese, under the scenario that net zero emissions is achieved by 2050. The International Energy Agency provides global demand projections for 37 critical minerals needed for clean energy transitions across various target and technology scenarios. A 2024 study by the International Energy Agency shows that the production of energy transition minerals could increase by 300% by 2040 to meet the growing demand for low-carbon energy technologies required to keep global warming at 1.5°C with deficits in mined supply emerging for nickel, copper and cobalt before 2030.

Critical Metals and Global EV Market
​
Battery chemistries that require metals contained in CCZ polymetallic nodules, nickel, cobalt and manganese, deliver high energy densities and are typically deployed in vehicles requiring long range (e.g., luxury and upmarket passenger cars) and power (trucks). In 2024, these battery chemistries accounted for 44% of overall battery manufacturing, which represented only a small portion of the overall use of nickel (~15% of nickel demand) and manganese (<1% of manganese demand). In addition, while 2024 saw an uptick in iron-based cathodes (LFP) used in entry-level EVs, production and use of LFP for EVs are concentrated in China. With continued production by Korean, Japanese and European lithium-ion battery producers, nickel-based cathodes are forecasted to retain approximately 50% of overall market share in addition to capturing 85% of cell production capacity outside of China by 2030, with production increasingly pivoting towards high-nickel content longer term. We believe softer-than-expected demand and supply-side expansions have negatively impacted nickel prices, with current prices at their lowest level since 2020, battery nickel demand grew 27% year-on-year in 2024.

In addition, we believe an oversupply of nickel largely produced in Indonesia, slowed production of EVs and resulting inventory of EV batteries/cathodes drove down prices of nickel and cobalt in 2024. According to several analysts, these surpluses, however, could be temporary and we believe potential shortages in nickel and cobalt supply could return in the 2027/2028 timeframe, subject to developments in Indonesia and responses by the U.S. and the European Union where regulators could impose measures to differentiate between sources of metal based on the environmental and social impacts of these sources

Increased Interest in Nodules from the United States
​
The U.S. Congress made several signals supporting the collection and processing of polymetallic nodules in 2024. In March 2024, members of the House of Representatives introduced H.R. 7636, the 
Responsible Use of Seafloor Resources Act of 2024
 which calls for political and financial support for domestic nodule collection and processing capacity, now with seven bill sponsors. The legislation was endorsed by the National Ocean Industries Association, the Breakthrough Institute, the Critical Ocean Minerals Research Center and industry players. In December 2024, the U.S. Congress passed the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which directs the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy, to complete a “Feasibility study of domestic refining of deep-sea critical mineral intermediates” within calendar year 2025. Our U.S. subsidiary’s application to the Defense Production Act Title III program for support with a site-specific feasibility study for its planned nodule-intermediate refinery remains active with the Department of Defense. The report from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy to the House Armed Services Committee (the “HASC”) prescribed in the fiscal year 2024 NDAA “Critical and Strategic Minerals and Materials Sourcing from Seafloor Resources” has yet to be made publicly available.
Environmental Opportunity
All nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese today are produced from land ores or recycled metal stock. Existing metal stocks available for recycling are insufficient to meet current demand. Even with high end-of-life product recycling rates, most of the new demand over the coming decades will have to be met by new mining. We believe the land-based mining sector is fundamentally challenged: ore grades are falling, production is moving to some of the more biodiverse and conflict-prone regions in the world, accessing ore bodies often requires a complete removal of ecosystems situated on and above such orebodies, and removing, breaking or tunneling through significant tonnage of waste rock. Toxic levels of heavy elements often found in land orebodies typically need to be removed, stored, and maintained indefinitely; a real challenge on seismically active and wet tropical islands in countries like Indonesia that accounts for most of the growth in nickel supply.

As a result of a vigorous campaign by several non-governmental organizations, some participants in the EV supply chain have called for a general moratorium on all forms of deep seabed mining until there is more knowledge about marine impacts of nodule collection operations. While our Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (“ESIA”) and Cultural Heritage Impact Assessment (“CHIA”) for offshore nodule collection segment of the NORI Area D project is still ongoing, based on already completed research into lifecycle impacts of critical metal production specifically from deep-sea polymetallic nodules, we identified how nodules can potentially provide an opportunity to significantly compress most lifecycle ESG impacts associated with conventional metal production from land ores.
​
​
To quantify environmental footprints of metal production from nodules as compared to conventional land ores, we commissioned several lifecycle assessments (“LCAs”) looking at the cradle-to-gate impacts of producing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese products from polymetallic nodules and how it compares to land-based routes. An LCA white paper examining a comprehensive set of impacts was commissioned by us and co-authored by certain of our executive officers in 2018 and reviewed by subject matter specialists and published on our website in April 2020; an LCA research paper focusing on climate change impacts was peer-reviewed and published in the Elsevier Journal of Cleaner Production in December 2020; an LCA research paper focusing on solid waste streams was peer-reviewed and published in the Yale Journal of Industrial Ecology in January 2022 and an independent LCA compliant with the International Organization for Standardization Standard 14040 on our NORI Area D project was conducted by Benchmark Minerals Intelligence (“Benchmark”) and released in March 2023. Based on these LCA assessments that we commissioned, we believe that we are positioned to become one of the lowest ESG footprint metal companies in the industry. The March 2023 LCA by Benchmark shows that the NORI Area D project model performed better in each impact category analyzed than all the land-based processing routes chosen for comparison, except for the global warming potential (“GWP”) and water consumption of producing cobalt sulfate, in which one land-based route performed better. While most of these reductions are attributable to the unique characteristics of the polymetallic nodule resource as described above, the elimination of solid processing waste streams onshore is due to our investment in a near-zero-waste flowsheet design and part of the low carbon emissions are due to our strong preference to locate onshore processing facilities in places with access to low-carbon power.

Benchmark modeled the land-based processing routes with background ecoinvent data and foreground data from two expert chemical engineers in the nickel and cobalt industry. The NORI Area D Project data is based on the NORI Technical Report Summary, dated March 2021, which included an initial assessment and an economic analysis of NORI Area D prepared in accordance with the SEC’s Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants set forth in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (the “SEC Mining Rules”). The NORI Technical Report Summary is filed as Exhibit 96.1 to this Annual Report. See Item 2 entitled “
Properties
” included in this Annual Report for additional information about the 2021 economic analysis of NORI Area D. 
As part of the ESIA conducted by NORI in partnership with world leading deep-sea research institutions and contractors, we are currently assessing the impacts of the NORI Area D Project on marine ecosystem function and services, including biodiversity. The CCZ abyssal plains are one of the most common and least populated habitats on the planet, akin to deserts on land. The CCZ abyssal seafloor is plant-free, food-poor and dominated by bacterial life forms. It has been studied extensively since the 1960s with over 150,000 papers published on polymetallic nodules in general and over 40,000 on CCZ nodules in particular.
The largest driver of uncertainty in assessing the potential future impact of nodule collection operations on marine biodiversity is our ability to measure biodiversity itself. Unlike biodiversity, biomass, measured as carbon contained in live organisms per m
2
 of habitat, is easier to measure and compare. Based on available data we have reviewed, we believe that the CCZ is one of lowest biomass locations on the planet. Metal production from nodules could reduce biomass at risk by over 90% compared to producing the same amount of metals from conventional land ores. 
​
In contrast, land-based mining for nickel and cobalt occurs in diverse countries as identified by Benchmark in a study commissioned by us and published in November 2023. In both Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the “DRC”), which are the world’s largest producers of nickel and cobalt respectively, the extraction of metal ores through open pit mines requires the complete removal of overlying ecosystems and contained carbon sinks, in turn eliminating the carbon sequestration. The study found that 1 kilogram of nickel mined from saprolite and limonite ore in Sulawesi, Indonesia removes forests containing carbon stock equivalent to 7.0 and 9.4 kilograms of CO
2
e, and 3.6 kilograms of CO
2
e in the case of cobalt mined in Katanga, DRC. Due to the resulting vegetation change, mining activities cause carbon sequestration services loss of 4.8 grams and 6.5 grams of CO
2
e respectively for nickel, and 9.3 grams of CO
2
e for cobalt per year.

As a precautionary environmental management and protection measure, the ISA has already set aside 43% of the CCZ or 1.97 million square kilometers as protected areas, or Areas of Particular Environmental Interest (APEIs), aiming to ensure that all types of habitats that could be impacted by exploitation are represented and preserved within APEIs. For comparison, only approximately 8.2% of global oceans are protected today and the global target agreed in the High Seas Treaty in March 2023 is to protect 30% of the oceans by 2030. Additional marine impact mitigation measures such as setting aside more no-take areas inside our contract areas and leaving partial nodule cover inside collection areas to aid natural recovery of bacterial and other communities are also being evaluated. We are collaborating with some of the world’s leading researchers to conduct environmental baseline and collection impact studies to design plans that could mitigate marine impacts of nodule collection through collection system design and adaptive management systems.

If the entire CCZ area currently under exploration (1.28 million square kilometers) were to be exploited over a 30-year period (which we believe is unlikely), these nodule collection operations would impact 42,500 square kilometers of the abyssal seafloor per year in one of the least productive areas of the ocean (with respect to the abundance of marine life). This is less than 1% of the estimated 4,900,000 square kilometers of the seafloor currently impacted every year by trawling operations that take place primarily in highly productive coastal waters.
​
​
Potential future commercial-scale nodule collection operations in the CCZ are likely to disturb marine wildlife in the operating area. We have completed studies baselining wildlife and ecosystem function, piloting the nodule collection system and assessing impacts arising from the use of this system immediately following the collector test and 12 months after the collector test. In total, almost 1 petabyte of environmental data has been collected and processed. For comparison, the world’s largest library, the Library of Congress, manages 21 petabytes of digital content. Assessment of impacts based on collected data is currently in progress. Given the significant volume of deep water and the difficulty of sampling or retrieving biological specimens in the CCZ, a complete biological inventory might never be established. Accordingly, impacts on CCZ biodiversity may never be entirely and definitively known. However, we believe similar challenges are faced on land, with an estimated 70-80% of terrestrial species still undescribed. Although we continue to review the data collected to date, we may not know the actual impact of commercial nodule collection on the deep-sea environment until after full-scale commercial production. We currently believe, however, that as the abyssal plains are the most ubiquitous habitat on the planet with low levels of biodiversity compared to the main metal-producing areas on land, it is likely that the impacts of nodule collection on global biodiversity will be less significant than those estimated for land-based mining for a similar amount of produced metal.
It is also currently not definitively known how effectively the risk of biodiversity loss in the CCZ could be eliminated or reduced through mitigation strategies or how long it will take for disturbed seabed areas to recover naturally. Prior research indicates that the density, diversity and function of fauna representing most of the resident biomass (including mobile, pelagic and microbial life) are expected to recover naturally over years to decades. Some uncertainty still exists around the recovery rate of fauna that requires the hard substrate of nodules for critical life function. Recent research suggests that carbon (food) availability is likely to be a more significant limiting factor to the ecosystem’s capacity to support nodule obligate fauna populations than hard-substrate habitat availability. 
15

Table of Contents
Therefore, we believe strategies such as leaving behind partial nodule cover and setting aside no-take areas to aid recruitment and recovery of nodule-dependent species in impacted areas look to be promising mitigation strategies. For example, recent research by NORI indicates that sediment-covered nodules left behind after collection activities ceased were exposed and became available as a source of hard-substrate habitat within 12 months. The effectiveness of these strategies in supporting self-sustaining populations of nodule-obligate fauna after nodule collection will be the focus of long-term monitoring studies in the future.
We are still in the exploration phase of the project and do not have the exploitation contracts necessary to commence commercial-scale nodule collection operations in the CCZ nor have we obtained the applicable environmental and other permits required to build and operate commercial scale polymetallic nodule processing and refining plants on land.
All extractive industries result in impacts to the receiving environment. Nodule collection is no exception and will impact the deep-sea marine environment through nodule removal, disturbance of seafloor sediment (“seafloor plumes”) and return of seawater used for nodule transport that is expected to contain residual sediment and nodule fines back in the water column (“midwater plumes”). Baselining the impacted marine environment by characterizing the ecosystem and then developing measures to avoid and mitigate these impacts is the central focus of our offshore ESIA program currently being undertaken in partnership with some of the world’s leading deep-sea research institutions. Nodule removal will impact species that depend on the hard nodule substrate for attachment. The severity of the impact will depend on (1) the extent to which these species are represented in the APEIs set aside by the ISA and additional no-take areas set aside by us and (2) the extent to which residual nodule cover will aid recruitment and recovery of these species in impacted areas. Disturbance of the seafloor by nodule collector vehicles is expected to disturb (mostly microbial) organisms living in and on the sediments. Impact severity will depend on the depth of sediment disturbance (expected to be approximately 3-5 centimeters based on modelling, laboratory tests, and recent collector tests completed in the CCZ by our subsidiary NORI and two other nodule contract-holders, Belgium’s Global Sea Mineral Resources NV (GSR) and the German’s BGR) and the impact this disturbance has on benthic ecosystem function. Over 90% of the entrained sediment is expected to be separated from nodules inside the collector vehicle and discharged behind settling back to the seafloor within a few hundred meters. The impact of the residual plume will depend on how quickly the smaller mobile sediment particles re-settle, how far they travel and how the resulting sedimentation impacts the benthic organisms. Less than 10% of entrained sediment that will likely evade separation inside the collector vehicle will be transported with nodules and seawater through the riser pipe to the surface production vessel where nodules are dewatered and residual water, sediment and nodules fines will be returned at greater than 2,000 meters in the water column below the highly productive photic zone and the measured lower limit of diel vertical migration of zooplankton in the pelagic zone. Potential impacts from the mid-water sediment plume could include clogging of the delicate respiratory and filter feeding structures of pelagic zooplankton species, such as jellyfish and krill. However, the mid-water discharge has been shown by the collector test to have very low solid particle concentration and to dilute to close to background levels within minutes. According to a research paper on midwater sediment plumes published by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”) in Communications Earth & Environment in July 2021, entrained sediment from the return of seawater used for nodule transport dilutes to natural background levels within a few hundred meters of the outlet. We believe this finding is supported by the monitoring results of the collector test completed by NORI in 2022. Another research paper on seafloor sediment plumes published by MIT and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in September 2022 found that 92-98% of benthic plume generated from the pilot nodule collector vehicle rose only two meters above the seafloor and settled locally within 10s to 100s of meters from the source of the disturbance, another result that was confirmed by the results of the collector test completed by NORI in 2022 on the NORI Area D property.
Our Strategic Positioning
We believe we are well-positioned to meet the expected demand for the critical metals contained in polymetallic nodules:
●
Supply for increasing infrastructure demand:
 As emerging economies grow and urbanize, steel demand is projected to rise 30% by 2050 and electricity demand is projected to accelerate worldwide by 3% per year through 2035. Critical base metals like nickel, copper and manganese will be required to meet rising demand for steel and electrical grids. While the copper market was volatile in 2024, demand is expected to double by 2035, potentially reaching 40-50 million tonnes and resulting in a 2-10 million tonne supply deficit. This oncoming wave of demand is anticipated to bring price premiums for low-carbon steel, particularly in light of Europe’s carbon border adjustment mechanism which requires buyers to purchase certificates to cover the embedded emissions of their steel imports beginning in 2026. Our lower carbon emissions footprint per finished tonne of nickel may improve our business prospects further.

Table of Contents
●
Supply for increasing battery demand: 
We believe the response to climate change is driving robust demand for EVs, renewable energy storage and infrastructure. To manufacture battery cells, gigafactories will need critical metals like nickel, cobalt, manganese, and copper to meet rising battery demand. Globally, the number of signatories to the Zero Emission Vehicle declaration announced at COP29 in November 2024 increased to 236, which is aimed at accelerating the transition to 100% new car sales being zero-emission globally by 2040, and by 2035 in leading markets. The U.S. government invested $ 110 billion in battery value chain projects since the IRA was enacted in 2022.
●
Path to energy security
: Following the 2023 restrictions China imposed on exports to the United States including a complete ban of gallium and germanium, which are needed to produce semiconductor chips, rare earth metal extraction and separation technologies used in production of hybrid and battery electric vehicle motors, and strict export controls for graphite, a key ingredient in battery anodes, China expanded export bans to include antimony in 2024. These events underscore a national security rationale for the U.S. and Western countries for reducing dependence on China as the world’s largest refiner of Class 1 nickel, cobalt and manganese. With our NORI and TOML contract areas ranked as the world’s first and second largest undeveloped nickel projects, respectively, by Mining.com in both 2022 and 2023, we believe the polymetallic nodules found in our NORI and TOML contract areas offer a source of four critical metals that can effectively diversify global supply chains.
●
Advancing developing countries: 
Both of our Sponsoring States are small developing Pacific Island nations impacted by climate change and expect to receive income streams from their sponsored areas if exploitation contracts are granted to extract polymetallic nodules in their sponsored areas. Royalties from commercial production of polymetallic nodules payable to the ISA are required to be distributed by the ISA with focus on developing countries. 
●
Potential U.S.-based regulatory pathway:
 On March 27, 2025, we announced that we initiated a process with NOAA and the U.S. Department of Commerce under the DSHMRA to consider a U.S.-based regulatory pathway for the commercial production of deep-sea polymetallic nodules in the CCZ.  We believe this regulatory pathway potentially offers a clear and predictable route to securing an exploration license and a commercial recover permit to polymetallic nodules found in the CCZ.  We are in the initial planning stages of this strategy, however, and there are no assurances that we will be able to secure any exploration or commercial recovery rights under the DSHMRA in a timely manner, or at all.
Our Competitive Advantages 
With the potential that our resources hold and the project advancements we have made to date, we believe we are better positioned than other suppliers to provide a solution to the growing need for the critical metals contained in nodules:
●
Availability of abundant and high-grade resource off the U.S. western seaboard:
 There are four critical metals (nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese) in relatively high concentrations in polymetallic nodules which we believe could offer a long-term secure supply of such metals in various industrial applications, as described above.
●
Opportunity for production in the U.S. of the critical metals contained in nodules:
 The current supply chain of battery materials to the U.S. is approximately 50,000 miles long and is predominantly controlled by nations and companies outside of the U.S., which is leading to increasing concerns about supply chain security in the U.S. and interest in breaking the U.S. mineral dependence by re-shoring battery material supply chain in the U.S.
●
Opportunity to reuse existing offshore assets and skills:
 We believe there is an opportunity for us to partner with offshore service providers with deep operational experience in subsea environments gained in the oil and gas industry and with existing assets that can be repurposed for our offshore nodule collection operations. We have taken advantage of this opportunity by forging a strategic alliance with Allseas Group S.A. (“Allseas”), a leading offshore contractor in 2019. In 2020, Allseas acquired a drillship that was repurposed and classified as the world’s first deep-sea mining vessel.
●
Demonstrated offshore nodule collection technology:
 In November 2022, NORI and Allseas completed the Pilot Mining Test where approximately 4,500 tonnes of wet nodules were collected and more than 3,000 tonnes of wet nodules were lifted 4.3 kilometers to the surface after traversing over 80 kilometers of the seafloor in the NORI Area D, achieving a sustained production rate of 86.4 tonnes per hour with a scaled-down prototype seafloor nodule collector vehicle. While several 
17

contractors have tested various seafloor collection machines, no other contractor has demonstrated an integrated nodule collection system since the 1970s.
●
Demonstrated onshore nodule processing technology:
 In 2021, we successfully completed the calcining and smelting of nodules into a manganese silicate product and nickel-copper-cobalt alloy intermediate product, followed by conversion and sulfidation of the alloy into matte. Test work has been successfully conducted on all process stages with the generation of test quantities of battery-grade nickel and cobalt sulfates in April 2024 and June 2024, respectively.

 We believe there is an opportunity for us to partner with onshore processors with deep operational experience in processing nickel-bearing ores and with existing Rotary Kiln Electric Arc Furnace (“RKEF”) plants that can be repurposed for processing our nodules into intermediate products. We have taken advantage of this opportunity by signing a non-binding memorandum of understanding (“MoU”) with our partner Pacific Metals Co. Ltd. (“PAMCO”), an experienced operator of a nickel laterite smelting complex in Hachinohe, Japan in 2022. Following the completion of a prefeasibility exercise by PAMCO to assess nodule processing at their facility, we have signed a binding MoU in November 2023 to complete a feasibility study to process the first 1.3 Mtpa (wet) of nodules at PAMCO’s facility. A demonstration trial at PAMCO’s Hachinohe facilities with 2,000 tonnes of nodules collected during the mining pilot is ongoing, which would further de-risk the project. In 2024, PAMCO successfully produced approximately 500 tonnes of calcine from nodules at their facility in Hachinohe, Japan.

●
Lower expected production cost:
 We are currently pursuing a low-capital asset expenditure (“CAPEX”) approach to our development and commercialization of operations for our NORI Area D project where we reuse existing production assets opposed to the high-CAPEX approach where the majority of offshore and onshore production assets would be newly built by us as described in our 2021 economic analysis included in the NORI Technical Report Summary. See Item 2 entitled “
Properties
” included in this Annual Report for additional information about the 2021 economic analysis of NORI Area D.
●
Lower expected ESG footprint: 
The LCA completed by Benchmark in March 2023 shows that the NORI Area D project model performed better in most impact categories analyzed than all the land-based routes chosen for comparison. This favorable comparison is explained by the fact that we are developing a new type of high-grade multi-metal source found on the abyssal plain, a low biomass, low carbon sequestration deep-sea environment removed from human settlement.

Exploration Contracts
We currently hold exclusive exploration rights through our subsidiaries NORI and TOML to certain polymetallic nodule areas in the CCZ.
NORI.
 NORI our wholly-owned subsidiary, holds exploration rights to four blocks (NORI Area A, B, C, and D, the “NORI Contract Area”) covering 74,830 square kilometers in the CCZ that were granted by the ISA in July 2011. NORI is sponsored by Nauru pursuant to a certificate of sponsorship signed by the Government of Nauru on April 11, 2011. The NORI Area D is the seafloor parcel where we have performed the most resource definition and environmental work to date. NORI commissioned AMC Consulting Ltd (“AMC”), a leading mining consulting firm, to undertake an Initial Economic Assessment of the mineral resource contained in NORI Area D and to compile a technical report compliant with Canadian National Instrument (NI 43-101), which was completed in March 2021. AMC subsequently compiled the NORI Technical Report Summary, dated March 2021, which included an initial assessment and an economic analysis of NORI Area D prepared in accordance with the SEC Mining Rules. The NORI Technical Report Summary is filed as Exhibit 96.1 to this Annual Report. See Item 2 entitled “
Properties
” included in this Annual Report for additional information about the 2021 economic analysis of NORI Area D.
TOML.
 TOML our wholly-owned subsidiary which we acquired in March 2020, holds exploration rights to an area covering 74,713 square kilometers in the CCZ that were granted by the ISA in January 2012 (the “TOML Contract Area”). On March 8, 2008, Tonga and TOML entered into a sponsorship agreement formalizing certain obligations of the parties in relation to TOML’s exploration application to the ISA (subsequently granted) for the TOML Contract Area. The sponsorship agreement was updated on September 23, 2021. TOML commissioned a Technical Report Summary by AMC, dated March 2021, which is filed as Exhibit 96.2 to this Annual Report.
Marawa - Termination of Service Agreement.
 On November 14, 2024, DeepGreen Engineering Pte. Ltd. (“DeepGreen”) issued a formal termination notice to Marawa Research and Exploration Limited, ending the Services Agreement dated October 1, 2013 (the “Agreement”), pursuant to DeepGreen’s right to terminate for convenience under the Agreement. The termination became effective on January 14, 2025 and we no longer have any exploration rights to the area of the CCZ that was covered by the Agreement. The impact of the cancellation of this agreement did not have a material impact on our financial results.

Business Strategy
Our contemplated business spans the entire lifecycle from the resource acquisition and definition stage through the collection and transportation phases offshore into the processing and refining of nodules onshore and finally in product marketing and offtake (and eventually recycling of end-of-life products containing nodule-derived metals). NORI and TOML, two of our subsidiaries, intend to operate in the CCZ under the effective supervision, regulation and sponsorship of the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga, respectively. We intend to utilize existing processing operations in locations like Japan and Indonesia and refineries in locations like South Korea and Canada. We have chosen a capital-light approach to our operations and have focused on forming deep strategic partnerships with leading offshore and onshore companies.
Our key strategic alliances include:
Allseas: 
Allseas, a leading global offshore contractor, developed and tested a pilot nodule collection system in the NORI Area D, completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. The experience from the development and testing program of the pilot system is now informing the design of upgrades and modifications into the initial smaller-scale commercial production system, which is expected to serve as the basis for the design of a full-scale commercial production system.
Glencore:
 Glencore International AG (Glencore) holds offtake rights to 50% of the NORI nickel and copper production. Glencore has the right to purchase from DGE 50% of the annual quantity of copper material and 50% of the annual quantity of nickel material produced by DGE from ore derived from the NORI Contract Area at a processing plant directly owned or controlled by DGE.
Hatch and KPM:
 We have worked with engineering firm Hatch Ltd. (“Hatch”) and consultants Kingston Process Metallurgy Inc. (“KPM”) to develop a near-zero solid waste flowsheet. The primary processing stages of the flowsheet from nodule to nickel-copper-cobalt (“NiCuCo”) alloy and matte intermediate were demonstrated as part of our pilot plant program at FLSmidth and Xpert Process Solutions, a Glencore company (“XPS”), facilities. The matte refining stages were tested at SGS Lakefield and the ability to produce high purity nickel and cobalt sulfates was demonstrated. The near-zero solid waste flowsheet is expected to serve as the basis for our onshore processing facilities.

Table of Contents
PAMCO:
 In November 2022, we entered into a non-binding MoU with PAMCO of Japan. In November 2023, we entered into a binding MoU with PAMCO whereby they must complete a feasibility study (anticipated to be completed in mid-2025) to toll treat 1.3 million tonnes of wet polymetallic nodules per year at its Hachinohe, Japan smelting facility. PAMCO’s Hachinohe facility is located on the coast in northern Japan and is equipped with port and processing infrastructure required to receive and process polymetallic nodules and to ship products to customers. In 2024, PAMCO successfully produced approximately 500 tonnes of calcine from nodules at their facility in Hachinohe, Japan.
The toll treatment is expected to take place on a dedicated RKEF processing line and produce two products: nickel-copper-cobalt alloy, an intermediate product used as feedstock to produce Li-ion battery cathodes, and a manganese silicate product used to make silico-manganese alloy, a critical input into steel manufacturing.
PAMCO successfully completed a pre-feasibility exercise pursuant to the non-binding MoU signed by the parties in November 2022. Under the binding MoU signed in November 2023:
●
PAMCO, with our support, expects to complete the feasibility study by mid-2025.
●
We will provide PAMCO with the exclusive right to the first 1.3Mtpa of the expected 3Mtpa of wet nodule collection capacity from our first nodule collection system until completion of the feasibility study.
●
The parties will enter into good faith negotiations to finalize definitive processing agreements on completion of the feasibility study.
The feasibility study is expected to confirm operating parameters and product specifications for PAMCO’s dedicated production line and define the scope and execution plan for any additional equipment requirements, which are expected to be minor. An extended pilot demonstration program utilizing existing kilns and furnaces at PAMCO’s Hachinohe, Japan facility is in progress, treating a 2,000-tonne sample of polymetallic nodules collected during the successful pilot nodule collector test completed by Allseas in November 2022 on NORI Area D, with the goal of optimizing the furnace refractory selection and confirm commercial scale operating parameters such as tapping temperatures and dusting rates when treating nodules through the Hachinohe facility. The cost of processing polymetallic nodules will also be estimated to help finalize the definitive processing agreements.
In parallel, PAMCO is continuing to study the addition of a converting facility to process the intermediate alloy to nickel-copper-cobalt matte, which is an upgraded intermediate feedstock for the production of metal and battery cathode precursor materials. It is expected that the additional facility would be constructed once commercial processing of polymetallic nodules to alloy has been demonstrated.
There can be no assurance that we will enter into a definitive strategic alliance with PAMCO in a particular time period, or at all, or on terms similar to those set forth in the binding MoU, or that if a definitive strategic alliance are entered into by us or that the existing facility will be able to successfully process nodules in a particular time period, or at all.
Phased Project Development
Currently, we are an exploration stage company working towards a pre-feasibility study, which is nearing completion, and will form an integral part of our ISA application for an exploitation contract for the NORI Contract Areas. Having completed resource definition and environmental baseline and impact assessment studies on NORI Area D, we intend to apply for an exploitation contract on that area first with a Plan of Work application to be submitted to the regulator on June 27, 2025. If we obtain an exploitation contract, we then plan to commence production offshore (“Project Zero”) using the 
Hidden Gem
 vessel which, subject to further modifications, is expected to be upgraded to a maximum capacity of 3.0 Mtpa of wet nodules. Subject to the success of Project Zero and any regulatory requirements, we then expect to move into the next phase of production (“Project One”) in which we intend to scale up production and expect to collect and process up to approximately 12 Mtpa of wet nodules at steady state (expected 2030-2045).

Current Work Program
We are currently focused on preparing to submit our application to the regulator for our first exploitation contract, which will include the entire NORI Contract Area, with the initial proposed collection activities occurring within NORI Area D. On November 12, 2024, we announced that NORI intends to submit its application for an exploitation contract to the regulator on June 27, 2025.
To reach our objective and initiate commercial production, we are: (i) defining our resource and project economics, (ii) developing a commercial offshore nodule collection system, (iii) assessing the environmental, social and cultural impacts of offshore nodule collection, and (iv) developing onshore technology to process collected polymetallic nodules into a manganese silicate product, and an intermediate nickel-copper-cobalt matte or nickel-copper-cobalt alloy product and/or end-products like nickel and cobalt sulfates, and copper cathode.
(i)
Resource definition and project economics:
 Having completed a total of nine offshore resource definition campaigns, collected samples and completed subsea surveys for resource evaluation, we defined the size and quality of our resource in the NORI and TOML Areas, as described below, in our SEC Regulation S-K (subpart 1300) compliant 
Technical Report Summary - Initial Assessment of the NORI Property, Clarion Clipperton Zone, Pacific Ocean 
dated March 17, 2021 (“NORI Initial Assessment”) and 
Technical Report Summary - TOML Mineral Resource, Clarion Clipperton Zone, Pacific Ocean
 dated March 26, 2021 (“TOML Mineral Resource Statement”), respectively, prepared by AMC. From this work, both NORI and TOML have reported measured, indicated and inferred resources. See Item 2 entitled “
Properties
” included in this Annual Report for additional information about these reported measured, indicated and inferred resources.We have continued to define our resource in the NORI and TOML areas, with the goal to develop project economics to pre-feasibility level with the intention of converting resources into reserves if possible.
(ii)
Commercial offshore nodule collection system development:
 We are working with our strategic partner and investor, Allseas, to develop a system to collect, lift and transport nodules from the seafloor to shore. The offshore collection system consists of nodule collector vehicles on the seafloor, a riser and lift system, a surface production support vessel and a surface nodule transfer vessel. The nodules are collected from the seafloor by self-propelled, tracked nodule collector vehicles using seawater jets aimed at nodules in parallel with the seafloor. No rock cutting, digging, drill-and-blast or other breakage are required at the point of collection. The collectors are remotely controlled and supplied with electric power via umbilical cables from the production support vessel, the 
Hidden Gem
. To test the system and assess its environmental impacts, we entered into a contract with Allseas to undertake a pilot trial of the collection system in the NORI Area D, which was completed in November 2022. The successful completion of the pilot trial will support our application for an exploitation contract with the ISA. An Environmental Impact Statement (“EIS”) for this pilot trial was submitted to the ISA in July 2021 and approved on September 7, 2022, with infield testing commencing on September 19, 2022. The surface production support vessel, the 
Hidden Gem
, was acquired by Allseas in March 2020 and has strategic importance to us, since it supported the pilot trial and is expected to be upgraded to a low-capital early production system. The vessel and collector system successfully completed trials in shallow and deepwater in the first half of 2022 prior to completing the collector test in NORI Area D in the fall of 2022, where approximately 4,500 tonnes of wet nodules were collected and more than 3000 tonnes of wet nodules were lifted 4.3 kilometers to the surface after traversing over 80 kilometers of the seafloor, achieving a production rate of 86.4 tonnes per hour.
As a result of the successful collector test in the fourth quarter of 2022, where more than 3000 tonnes of wet nodules were lifted to the 
Hidden Gem
, Allseas and NORI believe that they can upgrade the pilot nodule collection system, including the 
Hidden Gem
, into the first production system, which we refer to as the Project Zero Offshore Nodule Collection System.
In August 2023, we announced that Allseas and NORI are executing on a plan designed based on Allseas’ estimates to increase the maximum production capacity of the Project Zero Offshore Nodule Collection System from the previous estimate of 1.3 million wet tonnes per annum to up to an estimated 3.0 million wet tonnes per annum in stepped increments, a potential increase of 130%. The upgrades are expected to include the addition of a second collector vehicle, the use of a wider diameter riser pipe from the seafloor to the surface, implementation of a larger compressor spread and improvements to the system designed to further mitigate its environmental impacts.
System capacity is expected to be increased over time as environmental monitoring, production and experience milestones are met, which we believe will help manage environmental and operational risk, minimize up-front capital expenditure requirements and allow for staged increases in capacity as environmental review thresholds are met.

Table of Contents
The work program with Allseas in 2024 continued the reviewing of the test mining system’s performance, addressing operational issues, and identifying potential improvements for incorporation into the design. Key aspects included scaling technology to meet commercial production rates for the Project Zero Offshore Nodule Collection System and integrating this scaled-up technology into the Hidden Gem. As previously reported, the engineering scope was divided into six major work packages: collector, vertical transport system, storage & offloading, control & automation, electrical & instrumentation, and flow assurance. Engineering studies progressed on offshore nodule offloading and transportation systems, including hydrodynamic simulations and dynamic positioning analysis. Notably, the offshore loading process was independently peer-reviewed with satisfactory outcomes. Ongoing design reviews were conducted at Allseas’ office in Delft, Netherlands, attended by TMC, Allseas, and third-party consultants. Allseas supports our ongoing work to complete a pre-feasibility study, including assistance in establishing cost estimates, schedules, and pre-feasibility study level engineering deliverables. Discussions continued regarding system design specifics and further cost considerations. Furthermore, Allseas continues to work collaboratively with NORI on environmental monitoring scopes to be included in the EIS and Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan (“EMMP”) process.
Regular meetings between us and Allseas cover various project aspects, including health, safety and environment. We believe that as of February 2025, the ongoing program of engineering work is nearly complete and we are ready to launch into the next phase of development when we have further insight into ISA regulatory requirements and progress.
Further to our non-binding term sheet entered into in March 2022 with Allseas, we continue discussions with Allseas regarding the specifics of these upgrades and the continued development of the Project Zero Offshore Nodule Collection System and anticipate reaching definitive agreements on commercial terms and key terms around continued development and commercial operations with Allseas before the submission of the NORI exploitation application in 2025. There can be no assurances, however, that we will enter into definitive agreements with Allseas in a particular time period, or at all, or on terms similar to those currently expected, or that if such definitive agreements are entered into that the Project Zero Offshore Nodule Collection System will be successfully developed or operated.
In addition, on August 1, 2023, we entered into an Exclusive Vessel Use Agreement with Allseas pursuant to which Allseas will give exclusive use of the 
Hidden Gem
 to us in support of the development of the Project Zero Offshore Nodule Collection System until the system is completed or December 31, 2026, whichever is earlier. In consideration of the exclusivity term, we have issued 4.15 million of our common shares to Allseas (“Common Shares”) on August 14, 2023. We expect that the definitive agreement with Allseas discussed above will extend the exclusive use of the 
Hidden Gem
.
(iii)
ESIA and CHIA for offshore nodule collection
:

The ESIA and CHIA is an integral part of preparing our application for the ISA exploitation license on the NORI Contract Area. Our ESIA and CHIA programs consist of over 100 studies and rely on the work of multiple independent deep-sea research institutions and expert consultants. In 2022, we undertook the collector test monitoring campaigns which included completion of pre-collector test baseline data collection, monitoring of the collector test and completion of post collection surveys to determine the immediate impact to the environment of the collector. The monitoring was undertaken using the 
Island Pride
, a vessel contracted from Ocean Infinity Group Limited, deploying 2 remotely operated vehicles (“ROVs”), 3 autonomous underwater vehicles (“AUVs”) and an array of more than 50 seafloor sensors, supervised by multiple teams of scientists and sediment plume expert consultants, DHI Water and Environment Inc. and HR Wallingford who conducted a sound assessment. These campaigns commenced on July 15, 2022 and were completed on December 23, 2022, representing 146 operational days at sea. The preliminary plume results from the collector test have been shared with a wide range of stakeholders and presentations were conducted at the ISA during the fourth quarter of 2023. The results showed that the plume behaves as a density current with most material staying within 2 meters of the seafloor and most material settling within 1 kilometer from the source.
In October 2023, we entered into a services agreement with a third party in order for NORI to conduct an assessment of the benthic impact of the 2022 collector test in NORI Area D approximately 12 months post the collector test activities (“Campaign 8A”), which we believe will strengthen the quality of NORI’s EIS and Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan (“EMMP”) by providing additional information on the environmental regeneration in the collection test area. The key activities completed during Campaign 8A were box cores, multicores, benthic and covariance lander works, and megafauna and sedimentation survey around the test field area.
23

Table of Contents
Notwithstanding that Campaign 8A was subject to coordinated disruptive activities by Greenpeace International (“Greenpeace”) designed to prevent and obstruct the campaign, it was successfully completed on December 28, 2023. The team selected 19 sampling stations in the locality of the 2022 nodule collection system test in NORI Area D and conducted 39 multicore deployments, recovering 395 individual core samples. These yielded more than 600 subsamples that will be shared with independent researchers from leading marine research institutions for further biological analysis. Additionally, using a remotely operated vehicle, the research team deployed innovative seafloor lander systems capable of measuring seafloor oxygen fluxes using eddy covariance methods. This resulted in over 600 hours of data acquisition at a maximum deployment depth of 4,285 meters, which is the first time these bespoke sensor suites have been deployed at abyssal depths. This data is supplemented by over one thousand core sub-samples for geochemical analysis. Researchers also conducted the fourth annual recovery and redeployment of three oceanographic moorings within NORI Area D. The sensor payload on the moorings provides insights into the soundscape, regional oceanographic currents, and particulate organic carbon flux in the Eastern CCZ regions. This data contributes to the long-term oceanographic time series and importantly will cover the El Niño-Southern Oscillation fluctuations. Greenpeace spent 11 days actively obstructing the planned work of Campaign 8A, resulting in a significant impact to the work scopes planned for the campaign which we were able to successfully mitigate. In the case of TOML and our planned work as part of Campaign 8A, its work scope included the deployment of long-term monitoring moorings which was completely obstructed and was not able to be completed. The NORI and TOML work scopes were part of ISA approved plans of work and in NORI’s case, the post disturbance sampling was a specific suggestion of the ISA. NORI pursued legal action through the Dutch courts to halt Greenpeace’s activities and requested further assistance from the ISA. The District Court of Amsterdam ruled that Greenpeace’s occupation of NORI’s contracted vessel, the MV Coco, was unlawful, which led to the disembarkation of Greenpeace personnel. Greenpeace continued to actively obstruct NORI’s and TOML’s activities notwithstanding the court ruling. On November 12, 2024, the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam upheld the lower court’s ruling, reaffirming that Greenpeace’s occupation of the MV Coco was unlawful. The court also dismissed Greenpeace’s objection that NORI’s claims were inadmissible, affirming that NORI has a legally recognized interest in bringing claims against Greenpeace and retains the ability to pursue future legal action, including claims for damages, before Dutch courts. 
In 2024, NORI continued making progress on its ESIA and CHIA, both of which will be part of NORI’s application for an exploitation contract to the ISA.
Baseline data continued to be compiled and assessed for the ESIA.
Two global stakeholder webinars were held in 2024 which provided stakeholders with updates on the CHIA study’s methodologies and baseline data collection efforts. A review of bathymetry data to assess potential tangible cultural heritage sites was also undertaken and stakeholder engagement meetings were conducted in the Pacific, specifically in Nauru and Tonga, to inform the study.
(iv)
Onshore technology development:
 With the support of engineering firm Hatch and consultants KPM, we have developed a near-zero solid waste flowsheet. The primary processing stages of the flowsheet from nodule to an Fe-NiCuCo alloy and subsequent NiCuCo matte intermediate were demonstrated as part of our pilot plant program at FLSmidth (FLS, calcining) and eXpert Process Solutions, a Glencore company (XPS, smelting, sulfidation and converting), facilities. The matte refining stages were tested at SGS Lakefield and the ability to produce high purity nickel and cobalt sulfates was demonstrated. The near-zero solid waste flowsheet is expected to serve as the basis for our onshore processing facilities.
PAMCO:
 In November 2022, we entered into a non-binding MoU with PAMCO. In November 2023, we entered into a binding MoU with PAMCO of Japan, whereby they must complete a feasibility study (anticipated to be completed in mid-2025) to toll treat 1.3 million tonnes of wet polymetallic nodules per year at its Hachinohe, Japan smelting facility. PAMCO’s Hachinohe facility is located on the coast in northern Japan and is equipped with port and processing infrastructure required to receive and process polymetallic nodules and to ship products to customers.

We are also in the initial stages of considering the possibility of a U.S.-based regulatory pathway with NOAA and the U.S. Department of Commerce under the DSHMRA for the commercial production of deep-sea polymetallic nodules in the CCZ.
Summary of Mineral Resources

The initial assessment included in the NORI Technical Report Summary is a conceptual study of the potential viability of NORI’s mineral resources. This initial assessment indicates that development of the NORI mineral resource is potentially technically viable; however, due to the preliminary nature of project planning and design, and the untested nature of the specific seafloor production systems at a commercial scale, economic viability has not yet been demonstrated. See Item 2 entitled “
Properties
” included in this Annual Report for additional information about the 2021 economic analysis of NORI Area D.
The NORI Technical Report Summary and TOML Technical Report Summary do not include the conversion of mineral resources to mineral reserves.
You are specifically cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into mineral reserves, as defined by the SEC. You are also cautioned that mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic value.
 Inferred mineral resources have a high degree of uncertainty as to their existence and to whether they can be economically or legally commercialized. Under the SEC Mining Rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of an economic analysis. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. A significant amount of exploration must be completed in order to determine whether an inferred mineral resource may be upgraded to a higher category. Therefore, you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists, that it can be economically or legally commercialized, or that it will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Approximately 97% of the NORI Area D resource is categorized as measured or indicated.
Likewise, you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of measured or indicated mineral resources will ever be upgraded to mineral reserves.
Collection and Processing of Polymetallic Nodules
Collection, Transfer and Shipping 
We are planning a phased development for NORI Area D. Polymetallic nodules would be collected using offshore collection systems, comprising of nodule collector vehicles on the seafloor, a riser and lifting system (RALS) in the water column, and a production support vessel on the surface. To maintain productivity of the production vessel, nodules are expected to be recovered from the hold of the production vessel using materials handling conveyors and discharged to a dynamically positioned transfer vessel with an expected 50,000 tonne capacity. We believe that this activity can be performed while the production vessel is simultaneously conducting collection operations. The transfer vessel is expected in turn to load bulk carriers using a similar materials handling system to that of the production vessel. The bulk carriers will ship the nodules to onshore processing facilities.
Through our strategic partnership with Allseas, a former drillship vessel (the 
Hidden Gem
) acquired by Allseas in February 2020 has been converted and modified to undertake a pre-production collector test in which a collector vehicle, RALS and other systems have been tested. If we obtain an exploitation contract, the first phase of commercial production (“Project Zero”) would then be expected to commence after the 
Hidden Gem
 has been upgraded to become a production support vessel that can produce up to 3 Mtpa (wet) of nodules. The nodules collected in Project Zero are expected to be processed through existing third-party RKEF facilities on a tolling basis.

Table of Contents
In order to test the collection system, we entered into a contract with Allseas to undertake a pre-production collector test, which was successfully completed in the second half of 2022. We expect that Project Zero commercial production would then commence after the upgrading of the 
Hidden Gem
 into a production vessel. If we obtain an exploitation contract, we expect to commence Project Zero Collection at a rate of 1.3 Mtpa increasing in staged increments to up to 3.0 Mtpa of wet polymetallic nodules. For Project One, we believe that a fleet of four production vessels, each with multiple dedicated nodule collector vehicles, could be estimated to produce approximately 12 Mtpa of wet nodules at steady state (expected 2030-2045), which we intend to process, either at a new facility to be constructed by us or by potential processing partners, subject to available capital, or at third-party facilities pursuant to a toll treatment model.
We believe that this phased approach to development allows for proper management of risk and for progressive improvement of engineering and operating systems. The intention is to implement the project in multiple phases that will allow the offshore collection systems to be tested and then polymetallic nodule production to be gradually ramped- up. We believe that this approach will de-risk the project for a relatively low initial capital investment while retaining operational options, particularly in relation to logistics, to decrease unit operating cost as production is scaled up. Additionally, this phased development will allow for an adaptive approach to environmental management providing learning at small-scale which would be applied as production increases in scale.
Mineral Processing and Refining and Metallurgical Testing
Pyrometallurgical processing of polymetallic nodules has been extensively studied since the early 1970s.
From an early stage, we have recognized that processing represents a key to potentially commercializing seafloor polymetallic nodules and to becoming a low-cost producer of nickel, manganese, copper and cobalt products. Moreover, we believe that there is a commercial advantage in positioning ourselves as a leader in the onshore processing of seafloor polymetallic nodules.
To this end, we have worked extensively with leading metallurgical testing service providers with technical support from engineering consultancy Hatch to develop pyrometallurgical processing and hydrometallurgical refining technologies for the production of critical metals feedstocks from nodules. We have developed a near-zero solid waste flowsheet and have executed a metallurgical testing program consisting of multiple phases. The pyrometallurgical processing phases at bench and pilot scales have been completed at KLM, FLSmidth and XPS facilities. A bench scale hydrometallurgical program was completed in 2024 at SGS facilities in Lakefield, Ontario. Pursuant to an engineering and consulting services agreement, Hatch provided support and technical advice during the development of the pilot test program, including analyzing and interpreting the testing results through reports provided by the testing service providers.
We expect that the processing of the polymetallic nodules from the NORI Contract Area would also be ramped up in phases. This plan includes initially toll treating polymetallic nodules at existing RKEF plants, utilizing existing excess industry capacity. We believe that there is significant interest to deploy underutilized RKEF plants which may now have increased capacity capabilities as a result of the Indonesian government nickel laterite ore export ban restricting supply of the nickel laterite feedstock that they have previously utilized. These RKEF plants were originally built to convert nickel laterite to ferro-nickel alloy or nickel pig iron and could potentially be converted to smelt polymetallic nodules. 
In November 2023, we signed a binding MoU with PAMCO, where PAMCO must complete a feasibility study (anticipated to be completed by mid-2025) to toll treat 1.3 million tonnes of wet polymetallic nodules per year at its Hachinohe, Japan smelting facility. The toll treatment is expected to take place on a dedicated RKEF processing line and produce two products: nickel-copper-cobalt alloy, an intermediate product used as feedstock to produce Li-ion battery cathodes, and a manganese silicate product used to make silico-manganese alloy, a critical input into steel manufacturing. 
In parallel, PAMCO is continuing to study the addition of a converting facility to process the intermediate alloy to nickel-copper-cobalt matte, which is an upgraded intermediate battery supply chain feedstock. It is expected that the additional facility would be constructed once commercial processing of polymetallic nodules to alloy has been demonstrated.

Strategic Alliances and Key Commercial Agreements
Allseas Agreements
On March 29, 2019, we entered into a Strategic Alliance Agreement with Allseas, whereby the parties will conduct project development of an integrated offshore nodule collection system for use by our subsidiaries. As initially constituted, Allseas agreed to subscribe for (i) 6,666,667 DeepGreen Common Shares for a purchase price of $20,000,000 in cash (the “Subscription”), the entire amount of which was funded, and (ii) an additional 10,000,000 DeepGreen Common Shares in exchange for services rendered by Allseas in respect of the contemplated pilot mining test system (the “PMTS”), which would be designed, built and tested by Allseas. The 10,000,000 shares would only be issued upon completion of the pilot mining test in the CCZ using the PMTS (the “Success Fee Shares”), along with an additional $30 million cash success fee that would be payable simultaneously therewith. The Strategic Alliance Agreement also contemplated that the parties would enter into other commercial arrangements following the successful completion of the pilot trials of the PMTS in the CCZ.
On July 8, 2019, we and Allseas entered into the Pilot Mining Test Agreement (the “PMTA”), which governed the terms, design specifications, procedures, and timetable under which Allseas agreed to complete and test the PMTS, to be used by NORI. The PMTA was subsequently amended on September 1, 2019, February 20, 2020, March 4, 2021, June 30, 2021 and February 8, 2023. The Strategic Alliance Agreement was also amended on March 4, 2021 (collectively with the PMTA amendment of the same date, the “Amendment”), which Amendment became effective on September 9, 2021, the closing date of the business combination pursuant to the terms of the business combination agreement, dated as of March 4, 2021, by and among us (f/k/a Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corp.), 1291924 B.C. Unlimited Liability Company and DeepGreen Metals Inc. (the “Business Combination”). Pursuant to the Amendment, the cash fee payable pursuant to the PMTA was amended such that we would pay to Allseas (i) $10,000,000 on June 30, 2021 (which we subsequently amended with Allseas to change to within 10 business days of September 9, 2021 in a further amendment; this amount was paid on October 5, 2021), (ii) $10,000,000 on the later of January 1, 2022 and such time that confirmation is received with respect to the successful completion of the North Sea drive test, which was paid on April 25, 2022, and (iii) $10,000,000 upon successful completion of the pilot trials in the CCZ using the PMTS which was settled through the issuance of 10 million Common Shares in February 2023, along with additional costs owed Allseas under the PMTA in 850,000 Common Shares, in each case, priced at $1.00 per share under the fifth amendment to the PMTA. Pursuant to the Amendment, except as provided therein, Allseas may not, without our prior written consent, terminate the Strategic Alliance Agreement or the PMTA before NORI receives an ISA exploitation contract. 
The PMTA terminated by its terms upon the successful completion of the PMTS, whereas the overarching Strategic Alliance Agreement remains in place. 
On March 16, 2022, NORI and Allseas entered into a non-binding term sheet for the development and operation of a commercial nodule collection system. The PMTS developed and tested by Allseas was expected to be upgraded to a commercial system with a targeted production capacity of at least 1.3 Mtpa of wet nodules (“Project Zero System”). NORI and Allseas intended to equally finance all costs related to developing and getting Project Zero System into production that were estimated at less than EUR100 million. It was anticipated that NORI will not have to make any Project Zero System-related payments to Allseas until later in 2023. Once in production, NORI expected to pay Allseas a nodule collection and transshipment fee estimated at approximately EUR 150 per wet tonne in the first year of operations and expected to be reduced by more than 20% in the following years as Allseas scaled up production to at least 1.3 Mtpa of wet nodules.
Subject to the necessary regulatory approvals, Allseas and NORI also intend to investigate acquiring a second production vessel similar to the 
Hidden Gem
, a further Samsung 10000 vessel, with the potential for it to be engineered to support a production rate of 3.0 Mtpa of wet nodules.

Table of Contents
Following the successful completion of the NORI Area D pilot collection system trials in November 2022 and subsequent analysis of pilot data, the parties reviewed Project Zero System production target increases, system design changes and associated cost estimates revisions. In August 2023, we announced that Allseas and NORI were executing on a plan designed based on Allseas’ estimates to increase the maximum production capacity of the Project Zero Offshore Nodule Collection System from the previous estimate of 1.3 million wet tonnes per annum to up to an estimated 3.0 million wet tonnes per annum in stepped increments, a potential increase of 130%. The upgrades are expected to include the addition of a second collector vehicle, the use of a wider diameter riser pipe from the seafloor to the surface, implementation of a larger compressor spread and improvements to the system designed to further mitigate its environmental impacts and addition of a nodule transfer vessel with dynamic positioning to enable continuous nodule collection operations without stoppages from offloading.
System capacity is expected to be increased over time as production and experience milestones are met, which we believe will help manage operational risk, minimize up-front capital expenditure requirements and allow for staged increases in capacity as environmental review thresholds are met. 
In addition, in August 2023, we entered into an Exclusive Vessel Use Agreement with Allseas pursuant to which Allseas will give exclusive use of the 
Hidden Gem
 to us in support of the development of the Project Zero Offshore Nodule Collection System until the system is completed or December 31, 2026, whichever is earlier. In consideration of the exclusivity term, we issued 4.15 million Common Shares to Allseas on August 14, 2023. We expect that the definitive agreement with Allseas discussed above will extend the exclusive use of the 
Hidden Gem
.
There can be no assurances, however, that we will enter into definitive agreements with Allseas contemplated by the non-binding term sheet in a particular time period, or at all, or on terms similar to those set forth in the non-binding term sheet, or that if such definitive agreements are entered into by us that the proposed commercial systems and second production vessel will be successfully developed or operated in a particular time period, or at all.
Offtake Agreements
On May 25, 2012, our wholly-owned subsidiary, DGE, and Glencore, entered into a copper offtake agreement and a separate nickel offtake agreement (together, the “Glencore Offtake Agreements”), pursuant to which Glencore has the right to purchase from DGE 50% of the annual quantity of copper material and 50% of the annual quantity of nickel material produced by DGE from ore derived from the NORI Contract Area at a processing plant directly owned or controlled by DGE. Pursuant to the Glencore Offtake Agreements, for London Metal Exchange (“LME”) Codelco registered Grade “A” copper cathodes, the delivered price is the official LME Copper Grade “A” Cash Settlement quotation as published in the London Metal Bulletin averaged over the month of shipment or the following month at Glencore’s choice, plus the official long-term contract premium as announced annually by Codelco, basis CIF Main European Ports (Rotterdam, the Netherlands). For LME Registered Primary Nickel, the delivered price is the official LME Primary Nickel Cash Settlement averaged over the month of shipping or the following month at Glencore’s choice. For other copper-bearing material and other nickel-bearing material, the parties shall agree a price annually for the forthcoming calendar year on the basis of prevailing market prices for such copper products and such nickel products. The Glencore Offtake Agreements are for the life of the NORI Contract Area, and either party may terminate the agreement upon a material breach or insolvency of the other party. Glencore may also terminate either agreement by giving 12 months’ prior written notice. The Glencore Offtake Agreements do not extend to any other of our entities in the event other entities are the ultimate processing owners for metal products. The Glencore Offtake Agreements only apply with respect to metals processed and developed from the NORI areas that are processed by a facility owned or controlled by DGE and do not apply to other projects (including TOML). Concurrent with entering into the Glencore Offtake Agreements, Glencore made an equity investment of $5 million into our Company.
Binding MoU with PAMCO
In November 2022, we signed a non-binding MoU with PAMCO to evaluate the toll treatment of an initial quantity of 1.3 million tonnes of wet polymetallic nodules per year at PAMCO’s Hachinohe, Japan smelting facility. Potential progression to a NiCuCo matte product along with potentially higher throughputs were also included in the evaluation study. PAMCO successfully completed a pre-feasibility exercise pursuant to the non-binding MoU signed by the parties in November 2022.

Table of Contents
In November 2023, we signed a binding MoU with PAMCO, where PAMCO must complete a feasibility study (expected to be completed by mid-2025) to toll treat 1.3 million tonnes of wet polymetallic nodules per year at its Hachinohe, Japan smelting facility. The toll treatment is expected to take place on a dedicated RKEF processing line and produce two products: nickel-copper-cobalt alloy, an intermediate product used as feedstock to produce Li-ion battery cathodes, and a manganese silicate product used to make silico-manganese alloy, a critical input into steel manufacturing. PAMCO’s Hachinohe facility is located on the coast in northern Japan and is equipped with port and processing infrastructure required to receive and process polymetallic nodules and to ship products to customers. Under the new binding MoU:
●
PAMCO, with our support, expects to complete the feasibility study by mid-2025;
●
We will provide PAMCO with the exclusive right to the first 1.3Mtpa of the expected 3Mtpa of wet nodule collection capacity of our first nodule collection system until completion of the feasibility study;
●
The parties will enter into good faith negotiations to finalize definitive processing agreements on completion of the feasibility study.
The PAMCO feasibility study is expected to confirm the operating parameters and product specifications for PAMCO’s dedicated production line and define the scope and execution plan for any additional equipment requirements, which are currently expected to be minor. An extended pilot demonstration program utilizing existing kilns and furnaces at PAMCO’s Hachinohe, Japan facility is in progress, treating a 2,000 tonne sample of polymetallic nodules collected during the successful pilot nodule collector test completed by Allseas in November 2022 on the NORI Area D, with the goal of optimizing the furnace refractory selection and confirm commercial scale operating parameters such as tapping temperatures and dusting rates when treating nodules through the Hachinohe facility. The costs of processing polymetallic nodules will also be estimated to help finalize the definitive processing agreement.
In parallel, PAMCO is continuing to study the addition of a converting facility to process the intermediate alloy to nickel-copper-cobalt matte, which is an upgraded intermediate battery supply chain feedstock. It is expected that the additional facility would be constructed once commercial processing of polymetallic nodules to alloy has been demonstrated. 
On September 9, 2024, we announced that PAMCO had successfully produced 500 tonnes of calcine from processing polymetallic nodules in a rotary kiln and then on February 18, 2025, we announced that approximately 450 tonnes of calcine had been successfully smelted by PAMCO to produce 35 tonnes of NiCuCo alloy and 320 tonnes of Mn silicate products.
We expect this partnership to progress to a definitive agreement in 2025, subject to successful feasibility study outcomes and agreement to mutually acceptable commercial terms. There can be no assurance that we will enter into a definitive tolling agreement in a particular time period, or at all, or on terms similar to those set forth in the binding MoU, or that if a definitive tolling agreement is entered into by us or that the existing facility will be able to successfully process nodules in a particular time period, or at all.
Competition
Terrestrial metals production is capital intensive and competitive. Production of nickel, cobalt and manganese alloys is largely dominated by Chinese or Chinese-funded competitors. Additionally, Chinese resources firms have historically been able to produce minerals and/or process metals from land-based operations in developing countries across the globe (e.g., cobalt in the DRC, nickel in Indonesia and the Philippines) at relatively low costs due to scale, efficiency and regulatory factors, including less stringent environmental and social regulations and lower labor and benefit costs. 
In addition to the two contracts held by our subsidiaries, 17 other entities (ISA Member States and private companies sponsored by ISA Member States) currently hold ISA Exploration Contracts for polymetallic nodules in the CCZ, Western Pacific and Indian Ocean Basin. If and when they move into the exploitation phase, each of these contract-holders could become a potential competitor with respect to the collection of polymetallic nodules and the production of nickel, manganese, copper and cobalt products. Furthermore, several nation-states are working on developing polymetallic nodule resources inside their Exclusive Economic Zones (“EEZs”), with the Cook Islands granting three exploration contracts for polymetallic nodules in February 2022, India announcing an auction of polymetallic nodule exploration tenements in 2024 and a large polymetallic nodule deposit was discovered in the Japanese EEZ in mid-2024, with further exploration and test mining in the works.

Table of Contents
Beyond polymetallic nodules, nations like Norway, Japan, PNG, Brazil, India, Oman and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are exploring other types of deep-sea resources containing some of the metals contained in polymetallic nodules. There is increasing competition from new and existing marine mineral companies for the availability of marine exploration and support vessels, related marine equipment and specialized personnel, desirable exploration areas, suitable offshore collection and onshore processing equipment, and available capital. Some of our competitors may equally find more promising resources, identify or develop more economic technologies, enter into strategic partnerships that constrain our optionality, or may develop novel methods to collect nodules from the seafloor or process nodules into metals that are more economic than we currently contemplate.
Regulations
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
The Area is defined as the seabed and subsoil beyond the limits of national jurisdiction (UNCLOS Article 1).
The principal policy documents governing the Area, including the CCZ, include:
●
the UNCLOS, of 10 December 1982; and
●
the 1994 Implementation Agreement.
UNCLOS deals with, among other things, navigational rights, territorial sea limits, exclusive economic zone jurisdiction, the continental shelf, freedom of the high seas, legal status of resources on the seabed beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, passage of ships through narrow straits, conservation and management of living marine resources in the high seas, protection of the marine environment, marine scientific research, and settlement of disputes.
​
​
Part XI of UNCLOS and the 1994 Implementation Agreement deal with mineral exploration and collection in the international seabed, known as the Area, providing a framework for entities to obtain legal title to areas of the seafloor from the ISA for the purpose of exploration and eventually collection of resources. UNCLOS became effective on November 16, 1994. A subsequent agreement relating to the implementation of Part XI of UNCLOS was adopted on July 28, 1994 and became effective on July 28, 1996. The 1994 Implementation Agreement and Part XI of UNCLOS are to be interpreted and applied together as a single instrument. As of July 2024, UNCLOS had been signed by 169 States (countries) and the European Union.

International Seabed Authority 
The ISA is an autonomous international organization established under UNCLOS and the 1994 Implementation Agreement to organize and control activities in the Area, particularly with a view to administering and regulating the development of the resources of the Area, in accordance with the legal regime established under UNCLOS and the 1994 Implementation Agreement. In so doing, the ISA has the mandate to regulate all mineral related activities in the Area for the benefit of humankind and ensure the effective protection of the marine environment from harmful effects that may arise from deep-seabed related activities. The ISA is comprised of UNCLOS signatories, 169 Member States, and the European Union. All parties to UNCLOS are members of the ISA. Two principal entities establish the policies and govern the work of the ISA: the Assembly, where all 170 members are represented (the “Assembly”), and a 36-member council elected by the Assembly (the “Council”). The Council has two advisory bodies: the Legal Technical Commission (“LTC”) (41 members), which advises the Council on matters relating to the exploration and collection of non-living marine resources, such as polymetallic nodules, polymetallic sulphides and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts, and the Finance Committee (15 members), which deals with budgetary and related matters.
All rules, regulations, and procedures issued by the ISA to regulate prospecting, exploration, and collection of marine minerals are issued within a general legal framework established by UNCLOS and the 1994 Implementation Agreement. To date, the ISA has issued the following regulations (
https://www.isa.org.jm/mining-code/Regulations
):
●
The Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Nodules in the CCZ (adopted July 13, 2000, as amended in 2013; the Regulations).
●
The Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Sulphides (adopted May 7, 2010).
●
The Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Cobalt-Rich Ferromanganese Crusts in the CCZ (July 2012).
No commercial polymetallic nodule collection operations have started anywhere in the world. Currently, exploration activities undertaken are aimed at gathering the necessary information on the location, quality and quantity of the minerals of the seabed as well as collecting the necessary environmental and social baseline information. To date, the ISA has approved 17 contracts in the CCZ for exploration of nodules, one in the Indian Ocean and one in the Western Pacific Ocean covering more than 1.35 million square kilometers of the seabed. This represents 0.3 percent of the world’s oceans seafloor. Twelve of these contracts are sponsored by developing countries (including the sponsors of our subsidiaries NORI — Nauru, and TOML — Tonga). Thirteen countries and one intergovernmental consortium currently have contracts for the exploration of polymetallic nodules, seven countries have contracts for the exploration of polymetallic sulphides, and five countries have contracts for the exploration of cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts. To date, no exploitation contracts for extracting minerals from the seafloor within the CCZ have been granted. The ISA is currently working on the development of a legal framework to regulate the commercialization of mineral development activities, as described below.
In 2014, the ISA completed a study looking at comparative extractive regulatory regimes. This was followed in March 2014 with a stakeholder survey seeking comments on what financial, environmental, and health and safety obligations should be included under the framework (ISA 2014).
In August 2017, the Council released the first Draft Regulations on Exploitation of Mineral Resources in the CCZ, as subsequently amended. In March 2019, the Council released the advance and unedited text (English only) of the Draft Regulations on Exploitation of Mineral Resources in the CCZ (ISBA/25/LTC/WP.1) (ISA, 2018). The revised draft exploitation regulations incorporated the consideration of requests addressed to the LTC by the Council during the first part of the 24
th
 Session in March 2018, as well as certain comments by the Commission, and also reflected the responses to the first draft from stakeholder submissions. The exploitation regulations will create the legal and technical framework for collection and related operations. Finalization of the exploitation regulations remains subject to the decision of the members of the ISA. Final exploitation regulations must be adopted by the Council. The ISA was targeting to finalize these regulations by July 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted ISA meetings and discussions. At its July 2023 28
th
 Session meeting, the Council adopted a decision with a view to adopt final exploitation regulations during the thirtieth ISA session in 2025.
34

Table of Contents
We are still in the exploration phase of the project and have not yet obtained an exploitation contract from the ISA (“ISA Exploitation Contract”) to commence commercial-scale polymetallic nodule collection in the CCZ. An ISA exploitation contract application is comprised of several components, including Certificate of Sponsorship, Mining Plan, Financing Plan, EIS, Emergency Response and Contingency Plan, Health and Safety Plan and maritime Security Plan, Training Plan, EMMP and Closure Plan. In addition, we do not have the applicable environmental and other permits required to build or modify and operate commercial scale polymetallic nodule processing and refining plants on land.
Section 1, paragraph 15 of the 1994 Agreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI of the UNCLOS allows a member state whose national intends to apply for approval of a plan of work for exploitation to notify the ISA of such intention. This notice obliges the ISA to complete the adoption of exploitation regulations within two years of the request made by the member state.
On June 25, 2021, Nauru submitted its notice to the ISA requesting that it complete the adoption, by July 9, 2023, of rules, regulations and procedures necessary to facilitate the approval of plans of work for exploitation in the Area. The ISA did not complete the adoption of the rules, regulations and procedures by July 9, 2023, as required. At its July 2024 session, the ISA completed a first reading of the consolidated text and requested the Secretariat produce a second consolidated text in 2024. The ISA agreed to continue the negotiations of the Mining Code with a continued view to its adoption during the 30th Session of the ISA in 2025. The ISA Council has scheduled two ISA Council meetings in March and July 2025 to progress the Mining Code and has agreed to continue working inter-sessionally to advance the text. The second consolidated text of the draft Mining Code was released in November 2024.
Although we believe that the ISA will adopt the exploitation regulations and any necessary rules, regulations and procedures to facilitate the approval of a plan of work for exploitation by the thirtieth session as the ISA has indicated, there can be no assurances that the adoption of these regulations will not be delayed or paused as a result of the actions of ISA member States. The Draft Regulations and several supporting standards and guidelines are at an advanced stage, but there remains uncertainty regarding the final form that these will take as well as the impact that such regulations, standards and guidelines will have on our ability to begin commercial operations in a timely manner, or at all. If the ISA Council has not completed the adoption of such regulations within the prescribed time and an application for approval of a plan of work for exploitation is pending, the ISA shall nonetheless consider and provisionally approve such a plan of work for exploitation based on: (i) the provisions of the UNCLOS; (ii) any rules, regulations and procedures that the ISA may have adopted provisionally, (iii) the basis of the norms contained in the UNCLOS and (iv) the terms and principles contained in the Agreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI, including the principle of non-discrimination among contractors. There can be no assurance that the ISA will provisionally approve our plan or that such provisional approval would lead to the issuance of an exploitation contract by the ISA.
On November 12, 2024, we announced that our subsidiary, NORI, intends to submit its application for an exploitation contract to the ISA on June 27, 2025.
Consistent with NORI’s rights under the UNCLOS, and the 1994 Agreement relating to the Implementation of Part XI of UNCLOS (the Agreement), NORI reserves its right to submit an application for a plan of work for exploitation, which will be included as part of the application for an exploitation contract, prior to the ISA’s provisional adoption and approval of the exploitation regulations, the possibility of which was recognized in the ISA Council decisions ISBA/28/C/24 and ISBA/28/C/25, and to have that application considered and provisionally approved pursuant to Section 1, Paragraph 15 of the Annex to the Agreement.
The NORI Exploration Contract
In July 2011, our wholly-owned subsidiary, NORI, was granted a polymetallic nodule exploration contract by the ISA, providing it exclusive rights to explore 74,830 square kilometers in the CCZ pursuant to the NORI Exploration Contract (“NORI Exploration Contract”). The NORI Exploration Contract was approved by the Council on July 19, 2011, and entered into on July 22, 2011, between NORI and the ISA, and terminates on July 22, 2026, subject to extension.
35

Table of Contents
The NORI Exploration Contract, which was granted pursuant to the ISA’s Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Nodules in the CCZ (the “Regulations”), formalized a 74,830 square kilometers exploration area, has an initial term of 15 years (subject to renewal for successive five-year periods), and provides for certain obligations with respect to exploration, training, and other programs of activities for an initial five-year period. The NORI Exploration Contract also formalized the rights of NORI around future rights. Pursuant to the Regulations, NORI has the priority right to apply for an exploitation contract to collect polymetallic nodules in the same area (Regulation 24(2)). Such preference or priority may be withdrawn by the Council if the contractor has failed to comply with the requirements of its approved plan of work for exploration within the time period specified in a written notice or notices from the Council to the contractor indicating which requirements have not been complied with by the contractor. After a hearing process, the Council would be required to provide the reasons for its proposed withdrawal of preference or priority and shall consider any contractor’s response. The decision of the Council shall take account of that response and shall be based on substantial evidence. 
During exploration, NORI is required to, among other things:
●
implement the agreed plan of work;
●
submit an annual report to the ISA;
●
meet certain performance and expenditure commitments;
●
pay an annual overhead charge to cover the costs incurred by the ISA in administering and supervising the contract;
●
implement training programs for personnel of the ISA and developing countries in accordance with an approved training program;
●
take measures to prevent, reduce, and control pollution and other hazards to the marine environment arising from its activities in the CCZ;
●
maintain appropriate insurance policies;
●
establish environmental baselines against which to assess the likely effects of its program of activities on the marine environment; and
●
establish and implement a program to monitor and report on such effects.
On November 12, 2024, we announced that our subsidiary, NORI, intends to submit its application for an exploitation contract to the ISA on June 27, 2025. To date, no exploitation contracts for extracting minerals from the international seafloor have been granted. The ISA is currently working on the development of a legal framework to regulate the exploitation of polymetallic nodules in the Area, as described above. 
In 2021, NORI submitted a review of the implementation of the plan of work for the period from 2017 to 2021 to the ISA. The review included a proposed plan of work for the next five-year period from 2022 to 2026. On February 3, 2022, the ISA confirmed that the Secretariat and Commission had reviewed NORI’s report and noted that the program of activities for the next five-year period was acceptable. NORI is required to submit an application for extension no later than six months before the expiration of the contract. NORI intends to submit an application for a five-year extension in 2025.
The ISA Council may suspend or terminate the NORI Exploration Contract, without prejudice to any other rights that the ISA may have, if any of the following events should occur:
●
if, in spite of written warnings by the ISA, NORI has conducted its activities in such a way as to result in serious persistent and willful violations of the fundamental terms of the NORI Exploration Contract, Part XI of UNCLOS, the 1994 Agreement and the rules, regulations and procedures of the ISA: to this point, NORI is compliant and has never received a written warning from the ISA;

●
if NORI has failed to comply with a final binding decision of the dispute settlement body applicable to it; or
●
if NORI becomes insolvent or commits an act of bankruptcy or enters into any agreement for composition with its creditors or goes into liquidation or receivership, whether compulsory or voluntary, or petitions or applies to any tribunal for the appointment of a receiver or a trustee or receiver for itself or commences any proceedings relating to itself under any bankruptcy, insolvency or readjustment of debt law, whether now or hereafter in effect, other than for the purpose of reconstruction.
Additionally, if the nationality or control of NORI changes or NORI’s sponsoring State, as defined in the Regulations, terminates its sponsorship and NORI does not obtain another sponsor meeting the requirements prescribed in the Regulations, then the NORI Exploration Contract will terminate.
The NORI Sponsorship Agreement
NORI is sponsored by Nauru pursuant to a certificate of sponsorship signed by the Government of Nauru on April 11, 2011. NORI is a Nauruan incorporated entity and is subject to applicable Nauruan legislation and regulations. In 2015, the Nauruan government established the Nauru Seabed Minerals Authority to regulate activities carried out by companies sponsored by Nauru.
Throughout the period of the NORI Exploration Contract, NORI must be sponsored by a State that is party to UNCLOS. If the nationality or control of NORI changes or NORI’s sponsoring State, as defined in the Regulations, terminates its sponsorship, NORI must promptly notify the ISA. In either event, if NORI does not obtain another sponsor meeting the requirements prescribed in the Regulations and fails to submit to the ISA a certificate of sponsorship for NORI in the prescribed form within six months, the NORI Exploration Contract will terminate.
On July 5, 2017, Nauru, the Nauru Seabed Minerals Authority and NORI entered into a sponsorship agreement (the “NORI Sponsorship Agreement”) formalizing certain obligations of the parties in relation to NORI’s exploration and potential collection of nodules within the NORI Contract Area of the CCZ. The NORI Sponsorship Agreement will remain in force for the duration of the 15-year NORI Exploration Contract and will automatically extend for a further 20 years upon NORI reaching the minimum recovery level under an ISA Exploitation Contract, unless earlier terminated by the ISA as a result of NORI’s breach of the NORI Exploration Contract or pursuant to its terms. Upon reaching the minimum recovery level within the tenement area, NORI will pay Nauru a seabed mineral recovery payment based on the polymetallic nodules recovered from the tenement area. In addition, NORI will pay an administration fee each year to Nauru for such administration and sponsorship, which is subject to review and increase in the event that NORI is granted an ISA Exploitation Contract. NORI has begun discussions with the Government of Nauru to renegotiate the existing sponsorship agreement and has committed to paying corporate income tax within Nauru.
NORI is sponsored to carry out its mineral exploration activities in the CCZ by Nauru, pursuant to a certificate of sponsorship signed by the Government of Nauru on April 11, 2011. Sponsorship of an entity requires the sponsoring State to certify that it assumes responsibility for the entity’s activities in the CCZ in accordance with UNCLOS. NORI is a Nauruan incorporated entity and is subject to applicable Nauruan legislation and regulations.
The TOML Exploration Contract
In March 2020, we acquired TOML from Deep Sea Mining Finance Limited, providing us with exclusive rights to explore a 74,713 square kilometers area of the CCZ seabed. TOML holds an exploration contract granted by the ISA and sponsored by the Kingdom of Tonga pursuant to the TOML Exploration Contract (“TOML Exploration Contract”). The plan of work was approved by the Council, acting on the recommendation of the LTC, on July 19, 2011. The TOML Exploration Contract was then signed on January 11, 2012 between TOML and the ISA and terminates on January 11, 2027, subject to a potential extension under the terms of the agreement.
The TOML Exploration Contract was granted pursuant to the ISA’s Regulations, as well as Article 153 of UNCLOS, and formalized a 74,713 square kilometers exploration area. The TOML Exploration Contract includes an initial term of 15 years, which may be extended under the contract, and a program of activities to be completed within the first five-year period of the term. The TOML Exploration Contract also formalized the rights of TOML around future rights. Pursuant to the Regulations, TOML has the priority right to apply for an ISA Exploitation Contract to collect polymetallic nodules in the same area (Regulation 24(2)). The Regulations state that a contractor who has an approved plan of work for exploration only shall have a preference and a priority among applicants submitting 
37

plans of work for collection of the same area and resources. Such preference or priority may be withdrawn by the Council if the contractor has failed to comply with the requirements of its approved plan of work for exploration within the time period specified in a written notice or notices from the Council to the contractor indicating which requirements have not been complied with by the contractor. After a hearing process, the Council shall provide the reasons for its proposed withdrawal of preference or priority and shall consider any contractor’s response. The decision of the Council shall take account of that response and shall be based on substantial evidence.
Under ISA requirements contractors are required to submit five-year work programs. The first TOML five-year work program was completed in 2016 and reviewed and accepted by the ISA in late 2016. In 2021, TOML submitted a review of the implementation of the plan of work for the period from 2017 to 2021 to the ISA. The review included a proposed plan of work for the next five-year period from 2022 to 2026. 
On December 23, 2022, the ISA accepted TOML’s proposed program of activities for the 2022-2026 five-year period.
The ISA Council may suspend or terminate the TOML Exploration Contract, without prejudice to any other rights that the ISA may have, if any of the following events occur:
●
if, in spite of written warnings by the ISA, TOML has conducted its activities in such a way that results in serious persistent and willful violations of the fundamental terms of this contract, Part XI of UNCLOS, the 1994 Agreement and the rules, regulations and procedures of the ISA: to this point, TOML is compliant and has never received a written warning from the ISA;
●
if TOML has failed to comply with a final binding decision of the dispute settlement body applicable to it;
●
if TOML becomes insolvent or commits an act of bankruptcy or enters into any agreement for composition with its creditors or goes into liquidation or receivership, whether compulsory or voluntary; or
●
petitions or applies to any tribunal for the appointment of a receiver or a trustee for itself or commences any proceedings relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or readjustment of debt law, whether now or hereafter in effect, other than for the purpose of reconstruction.
Additionally, if the nationality or control of TOML changes or TOML’s sponsoring State, as defined in the Regulations, terminates its sponsorship and TOML does not obtain another sponsor meeting the requirements prescribed in the Regulations, then the TOML Exploration Contract will terminate.
The TOML Sponsorship Agreement
On March 8, 2008, Tonga and TOML entered into the TOML Sponsorship Agreement formalizing certain obligations of the parties in relation to TOML’s exploration and potential exploitation of a proposed application to the ISA (subsequently granted) known as the TOML Area. TOML updated the sponsorship agreement with Tonga in September 2021. Unless otherwise terminated by the parties, the term for the TOML Sponsorship Agreement is for the duration of TOML’s ISA Exploration Contract and will automatically extend for a further 25 years upon TOML being granted an ISA Exploitation Contract. Upon reaching the minimum recovery level within the tenement area, TOML has agreed to pay Tonga a seabed mineral recovery payment based on the polymetallic nodules recovered from the tenement area. In addition, TOML will pay an administration fee each year to Tonga for such administration and sponsorship, which is subject to review and increase in the event that TOML is granted an ISA Exploitation Contract. TOML expects to renegotiate the existing sponsorship agreement with Tonga prior to entering into operations in the TOML area and has committed to paying corporate income tax within Tonga.
Royalties and taxes
Royalties and taxes payable on any future production from the CCZ will be stipulated in the ISA’s exploitation regulations. While the rates of payments are yet to be set by the ISA, the 1994 Implementation Agreement (Section 8(1)(b)) prescribes that the rates of payments “shall be within the range of those prevailing in respect of land-based mining of the same or similar minerals in order to avoid giving deep seabed miners an artificial competitive advantage or imposing on them a competitive disadvantage.”

Table of Contents
An open-ended working group has been formed and has met numerous times to discuss potential ISA royalty and sponsoring State taxation regimes supported by modelling conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A final royalty and payment regime has not been agreed.
Under the NORI Sponsorship Agreement between Nauru and NORI and under the TOML Sponsorship Agreement between Tonga and TOML, upon reaching a minimum recovery level within the tenement areas, NORI and TOML have agreed to pay Nauru and Tonga a seabed mineral recovery payment for polymetallic nodules recovered from the tenement area, annually adjusted (from year 5) on a compounding basis based on the official inflation rate in the U.S. In addition, NORI and TOML will pay an administration fee each year to Nauru and Tonga for such administration and sponsorship, which is subject to review and increase in the event that NORI or TOML are granted an ISA Exploitation Contract. NORI and TOML have both committed to paying corporate income tax within Nauru and Tonga, respectively.
Environmental Regulation
The ISA is mandated through UNCLOS to “preserve and protect the marine environment” while developing the resources within the Area. Given the location of the NORI Contract Area, the ISA is responsible for assessing the ESIA prepared by NORI and for granting the relevant permits. 
The ISA has issued Regulations on Prospecting and Exploration for Polymetallic Nodules (adopted on July 13, 2000, updated on July 25, 2013). The regulations are complemented by the LTC’s recommendations for the guidance of contractors on assessing the environmental impacts of exploration. The exploitation regulations on deep-seabed collection will be complemented by various standards and guidelines, and environmental thresholds. The ISA is currently developing these standards and guidelines, and thresholds which are expected to be finalized by the LTC and adopted by the Council. The ISA has divided the required standards and guidelines in three phases.
●
Phase 1: 
Standards and guidelines deemed necessary to be in place by the time of adoption of the draft regulations on exploitation.
●
Phase 2: Standards and guidelines deemed necessary to be in place prior to the receipt of an application of a plan of work for exploitation.
●
Phase 3: Standards and guidelines deemed necessary to be in place before commercial mining activities commence in the Area.
​
Ten standards and guidelines have been prepared in Phase 1, provided to stakeholders for comment, reviewed and amended by the LTC and provided to Council for consideration and approval. Additional standards and guidelines will be drafted as part of the development of Phase 2 and 3. 
Although the environmental impact review process has not yet been finalized, all contractors have been made aware that the ISA requires the completion of baseline studies and Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”), culminating in an EIS for proposed commercial operations, prior to collection. An EIS and an EMMP, will be required as part of the application for an ISA Exploitation Contract for operations in the CCZ. Environmental and social baseline studies are being conducted, and NORI has engaged several leading deep-sea research institutions and scientists to contribute to our environmental and social impact assessment program, consisting of over 100 discrete studies.

NORI’s offshore exploration campaigns have included sampling to support environmental studies, collection of high-resolution imagery, full column physical and chemical oceanographic data and environmental baseline studies. Our last offshore campaign to collect environmental baseline data was completed in 2022. An integrated collector test involving trialing of collector vehicle and riser system took place in 2022. The environmental impacts of this test were monitored from a separate research vessel. An additional environmental campaign was executed in 2023 to return to the site 12 months after the test. Data collected from the test monitoring campaign and 12-month revisit campaigns will be used to forecast the impacts for a full-scale commercial operation in NORI’s EIS. NORI intends to manage the project under the governance of an environmental management system (“EMS”), which is to be developed in accordance with the international EMS standard, ISO 14001:2004. The EMS will provide the overall framework for the environmental management and monitoring plans that are required.
NORI’s EMMP will specify the objectives and purpose of all monitoring requirements, the components to be monitored, frequency of monitoring, methods of monitoring, analysis required in each monitoring component, monitoring data management and reporting. The EMMP will be submitted to the ISA as part of the ISA Exploitation Contract application.
Pursuant to Article 165(2)(b) of the Convention and Paragraph 11(a) of the 1994 Agreement, an application for a Plan of Work is first reviewed by the LTC and a recommendation concerning the approval of the Plan of Work is submitted by the LTC to the Council. Rule 44 of the LTC’s Rules of Procedure requires decision making by consensus. If all efforts to reach consensus have been exhausted, however, then a decision by voting shall be taken by a majority of members present and voting.
If a positive recommendation is submitted by the LTC to the Council concerning the approval of a Plan of Work, the Council is required to approve the LTC’s recommendation unless a two-thirds majority of its members present and voting, including a majority of members present and voting in each of the chambers of the Council, decides to disapprove the Plan of Work. If the Council does not take a decision on the LTC’s recommendation within 60 days, the recommendation shall be deemed to have been approved by the Council.
In addition, the sponsoring State has a responsibility to put in place legislation to ensure the entity it has sponsored complies with UNCLOS and ISA rules and regulations. Nauru implemented the Nauru International Seabed Minerals Act in 2015, which was amended and renamed to Nauru Seabed Minerals Authority Act in 2024, that NORI is required to comply with.
NORI’s assessment is that it is in compliance with existing exploration permits and contracts. In addition to working on key engineering aspects of the project such as designing the final nodule collector and the dewatering facility, NORI is also continuing the following tasks:
●
delineating nodule mineralization;
●
characterizing the nature of any materials returned to the environment;
●
developing oceanographic and physical information to inform models (e.g., sediment plume models); and
●
developing other plans, including the EMMP and the various subordinate plans.
In November 2023, we entered into a binding MoU with PAMCO whereby they must complete a feasibility study (anticipated to be completed in mid-2025) to toll treat 1.3 million tonnes of wet polymetallic nodules per year at its Hachinohe, Japan smelting facility. PAMCO’s Hachinohe facility is located on the coast in northern Japan and is equipped with port and processing infrastructure required to receive and process polymetallic nodules and to ship products to customers. This is an existing facility that has processed laterite ores since the mid 1960’s and has all the required operating permits to do so. The planned metallurgical process is expected to generate near-zero solid waste products. The deleterious elements’ (for example, cadmium and arsenic) content of the nodules is understood to be very low, indicating that with careful management, the environmental impacts of the processing operation are expected to be low. PAMCO are working with Japanese authorities to ensure that the environmental impacts of treating nodules are minimized and can be undertaken within PAMCO existing permissions or ensuring appropriate permissions are issued if required.
