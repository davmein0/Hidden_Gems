LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Except as set forth below, we are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings.
On October 28, 2021, a shareholder filed a putative class action against us, one of our executive and former director in federal district court for the Eastern District of New York, captioned Caper v. TMC The Metals Company Inc. F/K/A Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corp., Gerard Barron and Scott Leonard. The complaint alleges that all defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and Messrs. Barron and Leonard violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose information about our operations and prospects during the period from March 4, 2021 and October 5, 2021. On November 15, 2021, a second complaint containing substantially the same allegations was filed, captioned Tran v. TMC the Metals Company, Inc. These cases have been consolidated. On March 6, 2022, a lead plaintiff was selected. An amended complaint was filed on May 12, 2022, reflecting substantially similar allegations, with the Plaintiff seeking to recover compensable damages caused by the alleged wrongdoings. We deny any allegations of wrongdoing and filed and served the plaintiff a motion to dismiss on July 12, 2022 and intend to defend against this lawsuit. On July 12, 2023, an oral hearing on the motion to dismiss was held. The parties are currently awaiting a ruling. There is no assurance, however, that we or the other defendants will be successful in our defense of this lawsuit or that insurance will be available or adequate to fund any settlement or judgment or the litigation costs of this action. If the motion to dismiss is unsuccessful, there is a possibility that we may incur a loss in this matter. Such losses or range of possible losses either cannot be reliably estimated. A resolution of this lawsuit adverse to us or the other defendants, however, could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the lawsuit is resolved.

On January 23, 2023, investors in the 2021 private placement from the Business Combination filed a lawsuit against us in the Commercial Division of New York Supreme Court, New York County, captioned Atalaya Special Purpose Investment Fund II LP et al. v. Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corp. n/k/a TMC The Metals Company Inc., Index No. 650449/2023 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.). We filed a motion to dismiss on March 31, 2023, after which the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on June 5, 2023. The amended complaint alleges that we breached the representations and warranties in the plaintiffs’ private placement Subscription Agreements and breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Plaintiffs are seeking to recover compensable damages caused by the alleged wrongdoings. We deny any allegations of wrongdoing and filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on July 28, 2023. On December 7, 2023, the Court granted our motion to dismiss the claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and denied our motion to dismiss the breach of the Subscription Agreement claim. We filed a notice of appeal regarding the Court’s denial of our motion to dismiss the breach of the Subscription Agreement claim. The appeal was heard on November 8, 2024. The NY Appellate Division upheld the lower court’s ruling in December 2024, moving the case into the discovery phase. There is no assurance that we will be successful in our defense of this lawsuit or that insurance will be available or adequate to fund any settlement or judgment or the litigation costs of this action. Such losses or range of possible losses cannot be reliably estimated.
On November 8, 2024, a shareholder filed a putative class action against us and certain executives in federal district court for the Central District of California, captioned Lin v. TMC The Metals Company Inc., Gerard Barron, and Craig Shesky. The complaint alleges that all defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and Messrs. Barron and Shesky violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose information regarding the classification of the non-financial asset received from our partnership with Low Carbon Royalties Inc. and the derecognition of the capitalized exploration contract related to NORI. The alleged misstatements and omissions pertain to our initial classification of this non-financial asset as a gain on disposition (being a sale of future revenue) and subsequent reclassification thereof as a royalty liability (and re-capitalization of the exploration contract) and the restatement of our previously issued financial statements as a result thereof for the three months ended March 31, 2023, the six months ended June 30, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 in March 2024. The complaint purports to represent a class of shareholders who acquired our securities between May 12, 2023, and March 25, 2024, and seeks to recover compensable damages caused by the alleged wrongdoings. On February 6, 2025, the Court appointed a lead plaintiff. An amended complaint was filed on March 6, 2025. Pursuant to court-approved scheduling, we are expected to serve a motion to dismiss by April 10, 2025, the lead plaintiff is expected to file an opposition by May 15, 2025, and we are expected to reply by June 5, 2025. We intend to defend against the lawsuit. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be successful in our defense, or that insurance will be available or adequate to fund any settlement or judgment or the litigation costs of this action. Due to the early stage of this litigation, such losses or range of possible losses cannot be reliably estimated.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should read the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.
Overview
We are a deep-sea minerals exploration company focused on the collection, processing and refining of polymetallic nodules found on the seafloor in international waters of the CCZ, about 1,500 miles south-west of San Diego, California.
The CCZ is a geological submarine fracture zone of abyssal plains and other formations in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, with a length of around 7,240 kilometers (4,500 miles) that spans approximately 4,500,000 square kilometers (1,737,000 square miles). Polymetallic nodules are discrete rocks that sit unattached to the seafloor, occur in significant quantities in the CCZ and have high concentrations of nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese in a single rock. These four metals contained in the polymetallic nodules are critical for the transition to low carbon energy. Our resource definition work to date shows that nodules in our contract areas represent the world’s largest estimated undeveloped source of the four critical metals contained in nodules. If we are able to collect polymetallic nodules from the seafloor on a commercial scale, we plan to use such nodules to produce three types of metal products: (i) feedstock for battery cathode precursors (nickel, and cobalt sulfates, or intermediate nickel-copper-cobalt matte or nickel-copper-cobalt alloy) for EV and energy storage markets, (ii) copper cathode for electric wiring, energy transmission and other applications and (iii) manganese silicate for manganese alloy production required for steel production. Our mission is to build a carefully managed shared stock of metal (a “metal commons”) that can be used, recovered and reused for generations to come. Significant quantities of newly mined metal are required because existing metal stocks are insufficient to meet rapidly rising demand.
Exploration and exploitation of seafloor minerals in international waters is regulated by the ISA, an intergovernmental organization established pursuant to the 1994 Agreement Relating to the Implementation of the UNCLOS. The ISA grants contracts to sovereign states or to private contractors who are sponsored by a sovereign state. The ISA requires that a contractor obtain and maintain sponsorship by a host nation that is a member of the ISA and signatory to UNCLOS, and such nation must maintain effective supervision and regulatory control over such sponsored contractor. The ISA has issued a total of 19 polymetallic nodule exploration contracts covering approximately 1.28 million square kilometers, or 0.4% of the global seafloor, 17 of which are in the CCZ. We hold exclusive exploration and commercial rights to two of the 17 polymetallic nodule contract areas in the CCZ through our subsidiaries NORI and TOML, sponsored by Nauru and Tonga, respectively. 
We have key strategic alliances with (i) Allseas, a leading global offshore contractor, which developed and tested a pilot collection system, and is now working to modify it into the first commercial production system and (ii) Glencore which holds offtake rights to 50% of the NORI nickel and copper production if produced from a DGE-owned or controlled facility. In addition, we have worked with engineering firm Hatch and consultants KPM to develop a near-zero solid waste flowsheet. The primary processing stages of the flowsheet from nodule to NiCuCo matte intermediate were demonstrated as part of our pilot plant program at FLSmidth and XPS’ facilities. The matte refining stages are being tested at SGS Lakefield. The near-zero solid waste flowsheet provides a design that is expected to serve as the basis for our onshore processing facilities. In November 2022, we entered into a non-binding MoU with Pacific Metals Co Ltd (PAMCO) of Japan pursuant to which PAMCO completed prefeasibility work assessing the prospect of processing nodules using their existing facilities. In November 2023, we entered into a binding MoU with PAMCO whereby they committed to completing a feasibility study (expected to be completed by mid-2025) to toll treat 1.3 million tonnes of wet polymetallic nodules per year at its Hachinohe, Japan smelting facility, provided we obtain an exploitation contract from the ISA. The toll treatment is intended to take place on a dedicated Rotary Kiln Electric Arc Furnace (“RKEF”) processing line and produce two products: nickel-copper-cobalt alloy, an intermediate product used as feedstock to produce lithium-ion battery cathodes, and a manganese silicate product used to make silico-manganese alloy, a critical input into steel manufacturing. We expect this partnership to progress to a definitive tolling agreement in 2025, subject to successful evaluation study outcomes and agreement to mutually acceptable commercial terms. There can be no assurance that we will enter into such definitive strategic alliance in a particular time period, or at all, or on terms similar to those set

Table of Contents
forth in the binding MoU, or that if such definitive tolling agreement is entered into by us or that the existing facility will be able to successfully process nodules in a particular time period, or at all.
We are currently focused on preparing our application for a plan of work to the ISA for our first exploitation contract for the NORI contract area. Given that it is unlikely that the ISA Council would consider any application for a plan of work for exploitation before its next session in March 2025 and to ensure clarity on the submission process, consideration of the Application, and timeline, the Republic of Nauru, in consultation with NORI, formally requested that this issue be added to the agenda of the Council’s March 2025 meeting. Nauru’s proposed agenda item was strongly opposed by Chile, and it is unlikely for there to be an agreed upon process until after an application is received. Based on the current timeline in the consolidated draft regulations issued February 2024, the ISA application review and approval process is expected to be approximately one year from the filing date. See “
Project and Regulatory Updates - ISA Developments
” below for a further discussion on recent developments at the ISA.
To reach our objective and initiate commercial production, we are: (i) defining our resource and project economics, (ii) developing a commercial offshore nodule collection system, (iii) assessing the environmental and social impacts of offshore nodule collection, and (iv) developing onshore technology to process collected polymetallic nodules into a manganese silicate product, and an intermediate nickel-copper-cobalt alloy or matte product and/or end-products like nickel and cobalt sulfates, and copper cathode. In addition, we are also in the initial stages of considering the possibility of a U.S.-based regulatory pathway with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (“NOAA”) and the U.S. Department of Commerce under the U.S. Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act (“DSHMRA”) for the commercial production of deep-sea polymetallic nodules in the CCZ.
We are still in the exploration phase and have not yet declared mineral reserves. In addition, we do not have the applicable environmental and other permits required to build and/or operate commercial scale polymetallic nodule processing and refining plants on land.
2024 Highlights 
Below are a few of the developments that occurred in 2024.
Developments with our Projects
June 27, 2025 Submission Date for Subsidiary NORI’s ISA Application, and Expanded Company Strategy
NORI has set the date of June 27, 2025 for its expected submission of its ISA exploitation application. According to the ISA Council’s decisions ISBA/28/C/24 and ISBA/28/C/25, if NORI submits an application for a plan of work for exploitation before the RRPs have been adopted, the ISA Council at its next meeting, as a matter of priority, will consider the process for considering such an application. The ISA Council is not scheduled to meet again until March 2025 and we believe it is unlikely that the ISA Council would consider an application for a plan of work for exploitation before this session. In light of this, Nauru formally requested that the ISA clarify the submission and review process for such an application at the March 2025 meetings before NORI submits the Application and, therefore, has decided to submit the Application after the March 2025 meetings on June 27, 2025. At the March 2025 meetings, Nauru’s proposed agenda item was strongly opposed by Chile, and it is unlikely for there to be an agreed upon process until after an application is received.
Termination of Marawa Agreement
On November 14, 2024, DeepGreen Engineering Pte. Ltd. (“DeepGreen”) delivered a formal termination notice to Marawa Research and Exploration Limited, ending the Services Agreement dated October 1, 2013 (the “Agreement”), pursuant to DeepGreen’s right to terminate for convenience under the Agreement. The termination became effective on January 14, 2025, and we no longer have any exploration or other rights to the area of the CCZ that was covered by the Agreement. The termination is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or operations, with non-material ongoing costs and no termination penalties applicable under the Agreement.

World-First Production of Nickel Sulfate from Deep-Seafloor Polymetallic Nodules
In April 2024, we announced that we had successfully produced the world’s first nickel sulfate derived exclusively from seafloor polymetallic nodules during pilot-scale nodule processing. In partnership with SGS Canada Inc, the testing was undertaken on samples of nickel-cobalt-copper matte produced by us in 2021 using our efficient flowsheet to process high-grade nickel matte directly to nickel sulfate without making nickel metal, while producing fertilizer byproducts instead of solid waste or tailings.
Extensive Submission of Deep-Sea Environmental Data to the ISA
In May 2024, we announced that our subsidiary NORI had made a second submission of key environmental data from all prior environmental baseline campaigns conducted in the NORI Area D exploration area up to January 2022 to DeepData, an open database of contractor data managed by the ISA. The submission of this batch of data includes an extensive set of geochemical and biological samples from across the water column.
World-First Cobalt Sulfate Produced from Deep-Seafloor Polymetallic Nodules
On June 12, 2024, we announced that we successfully produced the world’s first cobalt sulfate derived exclusively from seafloor polymetallic nodules. The cobalt sulfate was generated during bench-scale testing of our hydrometallurgical flowsheet design with SGS Canada Inc. Based on samples of nickel-cobalt-copper matte first produced by us in 2021, SGS tested our efficient flowsheet to process high-grade nickel-copper-cobalt matte directly to high-purity cobalt sulfate without making cobalt metal, while producing fertilizer byproducts instead of solid waste or tailings. The milestone followed the news in May 2024 of our successful production of nickel sulfate, a key raw material input used in the production of energy-dense EV batteries.
Third Annual Impact Report Published
On July 29, 2024, we published our third annual Impact Report to provide an update on key milestones achieved in our assessment of the environmental impacts of nodule collection including, what we believe, is the successful collection of sufficient quantities of environmental baseline and impact data to develop an Environmental Impact Statement and Environmental Mitigation and Management Plan (EMMP) for the world’s first deep-seafloor nodule collection project.
TMC and PAMCO Successfully Produce Calcine in Commercial-Scale Processing of Polymetallic Nodules
In September 2024, we announced that we had successfully produced high temperature material (calcine) during the first phase of a commercial-scale campaign to process a 2,000-tonne sample of deep-seafloor polymetallic nodules at our partner PAMCO’s Hachinohe Rotary Kiln Electric-Arc Furnace facility in Hachinohe, Japan. Approximately 500 tonnes of calcine were produced. On February 18, 2025, we announced that PAMCO had successfully smelted 450 tonnes of calcine into 35 tonnes of NiCuCo alloy and 320 tonnes of Mn silicate products.
ISA Developments
ISA Consolidated Draft Regulations
In February 2024, the ISA released the first consolidated draft regulations on exploitation of Mineral resources in the Area. The revised second consolidated text was released in November 2024. Negotiations on the revised second consolidated text began during part 1 of the ISA’s 30
th
 Session.

Industry Developments
TMC Applauds U.S. Congressional Mandate for 2025 Defense Department Feasibility Study on Nodule Refining
On December 30, 2024, we welcomed the signing of legislation calling for financial support from the Defense Department’s Industrial Base Policy office to “assess the feasibility of improving domestic capabilities for refining polymetallic nodule-derived intermediates into high-purity nickel, cobalt sulfate, and copper.” The legislation, signed into law by President Biden on December 23, 2024, was led by the HASC and calls for the completion of a feasibility study by the end of 2025 for a nodule-derived intermediate refinery which would bring the U.S. closer to addressing the biggest vulnerability in its domestic battery supply chains – nickel refining – as identified in Executive Order 14017 from 2021. In addition, our U.S. subsidiary has an outstanding application seeking a $9 million grant under the Defense Production Act Title III program for feasibility work on a domestic refinery for nodule-derived intermediate products.
Responsible Use of Seafloor Resources Act (RUSRA)
In March 2024, legislation was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives calling for the U.S. to “support international governance of seafloor resource exploration and responsible polymetallic nodule collection by allied partners”, and to “provide financial, diplomatic, or other forms of support for seafloor nodule collection, processing and refining.”
TMC CEO Testifies to U.S. House of Representatives on Benefits of Nodules 
In September 2024, our CEO Gerard Barron gave testimony during a meeting of the Critical Mineral Policy Working Group for the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party to discuss the U.S.’ heavy reliance on Chinese imports of critical minerals and policy solutions to incentivize greater cooperation with allies to create alternative supplies. Mr. Barron spoke to the potential of seafloor nodules to secure U.S. supplies of key minerals for the energy transition and defense sectors.
Rebuttal to Publication
In July 2024, Nature Geoscience published a paper claiming that seafloor nodules produce oxygen in the absence of sunlight. Since the paper’s publication, multiple rebuttals have been submitted to Nature warning of serious flaws with the paper’s methodology and claims, prompting calls for the paper to be retracted. Researchers at the University of Tokyo and University of Gothenburg are among the experts that have submitted pre-print rebuttals to the article’s author. Our own rebuttal, published September 19, 2024, notes selective reporting of data and omission of key evidence, including experiments that show oxygen levels increasing without nodules, directly contradicting the authors’ claims.
Financing
TMC Announces Registered Direct Offering 
On November 14, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain new and existing institutional investors for the sale of an aggregate of 17,500,000 common shares (the “Shares”) and accompanying Class B warrants (the “Class B Warrants”), in a registered direct offering (the “2024 Registered Direct Offering”). The offering price was $1.00 per Share, resulting in initial gross proceeds of $17.5 million ($16.5 million after associated fees), with each Share including an accompanying Class B Warrant to purchase 0.5 common shares. The Class B Warrants are exercisable immediately upon issuance at a price of $2.00 per share and expire five years from issuance. On November 26, 2024, we entered into the First Amendment to the Securities Purchase Agreement, increasing the offering by an additional 2,400,000 common shares and accompanying Class B Warrants to purchase 1,200,000 common shares on the same terms and conditions. As a result, the total number of Shares and accompanying Class B Warrants issued in the registered direct offering increased to 19,900,000 Shares and Class B Warrants to purchase 9,950,000 common shares, bringing the aggregate gross proceeds to $19.9 million, all of which has been received, before deducting offering expenses. The Class B Warrants include customary anti-dilution protections and a repurchase feature, permitting us to repurchase the warrants for $0.0001 per Common Share underlying the Class B Warrants if the volume-weighted average price of our common shares exceeds $5.00 per share for each trading day in a consecutive 30-trading-day period.

On March 22, 2024, we entered into the Second Amendment to the Unsecured Credit Facility with Argentum Cedit Virtuti GCV to further extend the 2023 Credit Facility to August 31, 2025 and to provide that the underutilization fee thereunder shall cease to be payable after the date on which we or the Lender gives notice of termination of the agreement On August 16, 2024, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the 2023 Credit Facility, to increase the borrowing limit of the 2023 Credit Facility to $27.5 million. On November 14, 2024, as a result of the 2024 Registered Direct Offering the borrowing limit of the 2023 Credit Facility was returned to $25 million.
2024 Credit Facility with ERAS Capital LLC and Gerard Barron
On March 22, 2024, we entered into an Unsecured Credit Facility (the “2024 Credit Facility”) with Gerard Barron, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and ERAS Capital LLC, the family fund of our director, Andrei Karkar (collectively, the “2024 Lenders”), pursuant to which, we may borrow from the 2024 Lenders up to $20 million in the aggregate ($10 million from each of the 2024 Lenders), from time to time, subject to certain conditions. All amounts drawn under the 2024 Credit Facility will bear interest at the 6-month Secured Overnight Funding Rate (“SOFR”), 180-day average plus 4.0% per annum payable in cash semi-annually (or plus 5% if paid-in-kind at maturity, at our election) on the first business day of each of June and January. We will pay an underutilization fee equal to 4.0% per annum payable semi-annually for any amounts that remain undrawn under the 2024 Credit Facility. We have the right to pre-pay the entire amount outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility at any time, before the 2024 Credit Facility’s maturity of September 22, 2025. The 2024 Credit Facility also contains customary events of default. The 2024 Credit Facility will terminate automatically if we or any of our subsidiaries raise at least $50 million in the aggregate (i) through the issuance of any of our or our subsidiaries’ debt or equity securities, or (ii) in prepayments under an off-take agreement or similar commercial agreement. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have drawn $2.5 million from the 2024 Credit Facility. On August 13, 2024, we entered into the First Amendment to the 2024 Credit Facility with the 2024 Lenders to increase the borrowing limit of the 2024 Credit Facility to $25 million in the aggregate ($12.5 million from each of the 2024 Lenders). On November 14, 2024, we entered into the Second Amendment to the 2024 Credit Facility with the 2024 Lenders, to increase the borrowing limit to $38 million in the aggregate ($19 million from each of the 2024 Lenders) and to extend the maturity of the 2024 Credit Facility to December 31, 2025.

the process at scale. The process data and operational experience gathered during the commercial-scale processing trial will inform expected definitive processing agreements between the parties.
Extension of Credit Facility with ERAS Capital LLC and Gerard Barron
On March 26, 2025, we entered into the Third Amendment to the 2024 Credit Facility with the 2024 Lenders, to, among other things, increase the borrowing limit to $44 million in the aggregate ($22 million from each of the 2024 Lenders) and extend the maturity of the 2024 Credit Facility to June 30, 2026.
Extension of Allseas Working Capital Loan Agreement and Termination of Allseas 2023 Credit Facility
On March 24,2025, we entered into a Letter Agreement (the “Letter Agreement”) with Allseas Investments and Argentum Cedit Virtuti GCV, pursuant to which the repayment date under our working capital loan agreement (“Working Capital Loan Agreement”) with Allseas Investments dated September 9, 2024 was extended to September 30, 2025.
Additionally, under the Letter Agreement, we and Argentum Cedit Virtuti GCV agreed to cancel the unsecured credit facility established in 2023 with no outstanding amounts remaining, other than our obligation to pay the underutilization fee thereunder.
Exploration of Potential U.S.-Based Regulatory Pathway
On March 27, 2025, we announced that we initiated a process with NOAA and the U.S. Department of Commerce under the DSHMRA to consider a U.S.-based regulatory pathway for the commercial production of deep-sea polymetallic nodules in the CCZ.  We believe this regulatory pathway potentially offers a clear and predictable route to securing an exploration license and a commercial recover permit to polymetallic nodules found in the CCZ.  We are in the initial planning stages of this strategy, however, and there are no assurances that we will be able to secure any exploration or commercial recovery rights under the DSHMRA in a timely manner, or at all.
Exploration Contracts 
We currently hold exclusive exploration rights to certain polymetallic nodule areas in the CCZ through our subsidiaries NORI and TOML, sponsored by the Republic of Nauru and the Kingdom of Tonga, respectively. 
NORI.
    NORI our wholly-owned subsidiary, holds exploration rights to four blocks (NORI Area A, B, C, and D, the “NORI Contract Area”) covering 74,830 square kilometers in the CCZ that were granted by the ISA in July 2011. NORI is sponsored by Nauru pursuant to a certificate of sponsorship signed by the Government of Nauru on April 11, 2011. The D block of the NORI area (“NORI Area D”) is the seafloor parcel where we have performed the most resource definition and environmental work to date. NORI commissioned AMC Consulting Ltd, a leading mining consulting firm, to undertake an Initial Economic Assessment of the mineral resource contained in NORI Area D and to compile a technical report compliant with Canadian National Instrument (NI 43-101), which was completed in March 2021. AMC subsequently compiled the NORI Technical Report Summary, dated March 2021, which included an initial assessment and an economic analysis of NORI Area D prepared in accordance with the SEC’s Modernization of Property Disclosures for Mining Registrants set forth in subpart 1300 of Regulation S-K (the “SEC Mining Rules”). The NORI Technical Report Summary is filed as Exhibit 96.1 to this Annual Report. See Item 2 entitled “
Properties
” included in this Annual Report for additional information about the 2021 economic analysis of NORI Area D.
​
TOML.
    TOML our wholly-owned subsidiary which we acquired in March 2020, holds exploration rights to an area covering 74,713 square kilometers in the CCZ that were granted by the ISA in January 2012 (the “TOML Contract Area”). On March 8, 2008, Tonga and TOML entered into a sponsorship agreement formalizing certain obligations of the parties in relation to TOML’s exploration application to the ISA (subsequently granted) for the TOML Contract Area. The sponsorship agreement was updated on September 23, 2021. TOML commissioned a Technical Report Summary by AMC, dated March 2021, which is filed as Exhibit 96.2 to this Annual Report.

Key Trends, Opportunities and Uncertainties 
We are currently a pre-revenue company, and we do not anticipate earning revenues (other than potential service revenue) until NORI receives an exploitation contract and we are able to successfully collect and process polymetallic nodules into saleable products on a commercial scale. We believe that our performance and future success pose risks and challenges, including those related to finalization of ISA regulations to allow for commercial exploitation, approval of an application for the ISA exploitation contract, development of environmental regulations associated with our business and development of our technologies to collect and process polymetallic nodules. These risks, as well as other risks, are discussed in Item 7A entitled “
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
” and Item 1A entitled “
Risk Factors
” included in this Annual Report.
Impact of Climate Change 
We are committed to adopting the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures recommendations. In our Impact Report, we provided climate-related disclosure and shared how our vision is aligned with supporting the global energy transition and contributing to a circular metals economy. We recognize that climate change may have a meaningful impact on our financial performance over time, and we continue the process of assessing key risks and corresponding action plans to mitigate their negative impact of climate change on our operations.
Our climate related transition risks and opportunities are likely to be driven by changes in regulation, public policy, and technology as well as risk of business disruptions due to climate related events.
Regulatory risks
Regulations related to emissions limits, such as cap and trade schemes and carbon taxes, would likely increase our future cost of operations, energy purchase, and equipment selection in addition to costs associated with potential carbon tax and/or purchase of carbon offsets. It is difficult to estimate the impact of potential future regulations on future operations.
We are working on a plan for continuous reduction of emissions and aiming to develop operations with near zero emissions. When selecting the location of our onshore plant, one of our requirements is access to renewable energy as our metallurgical process will be the most energy intensive step in our operations. In addition, we are seeking to replace metallurgical coal used as reductant during calcining of nodules and have tested potential renewable alternatives. We are also identifying the best approach for decarbonizing our offshore operations. To date, we have not experienced any material impact to our business related to potential regulations but will continue to evaluate and monitor future developments.
Public policy risks
Awareness of climate change related impacts and commitments made by companies and governments to achieve net zero emissions, continues to grow. We support the ambition of the U.S. to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by no later than 2050 and to reach half of all new vehicles sales to be EVs by 2030. We are committed to achieving zero emissions and are reviewing and designing technologies to achieve this goal. The location of our onshore plant will be key, and we will be working on science-based targets and scenario analysis.
To support the EV and battery storage value chain, we are seeking to close the emerging supply gap of the critical metals contained in nodules needed for the transition to renewable energy and adoption of EVs. We plan to take advantage of this opportunity to supply these potentially lower carbon critical metals, avoid deforestation, and help reduce the cost of batteries.
Technology risks
The timing and deployment of technologies to support the transition to a lower carbon economy can be uncertain. Investments in assets with long lifespans require the selection of not only the proper technology, but also the proper timing to retain the ability to adapt to future developments. There are also risks associated with the additional costs of lower emissions technology and transition to renewables. To mitigate this risk, we based our flowsheet development on existing proven technology, while retaining sufficient flexibility to be able to retrofit processes with new lower carbon technology as they become available.

Table of Contents
Physical risks
Our main activity currently consists of offshore exploration campaigns for research and testing purposes, and technology development at partner facilities. However, once a location is selected for our onshore metallurgical plant, we will assess the risks associated with hurricanes, floods, and extreme weather.
Impact of Global Inflation 
The global inflation rate rose sharply in 2022, and stayed relatively high in 2023 and 2024, marine fuel prices and vessel day rates remained high and have increased our exploration expenses beyond what was originally expected. Additionally, we are experiencing higher offshore labor costs through our contractors.
As a pre-revenue company, persistent inflation may affect our ultimate cash requirements prior to our ability to begin commercial production.
Basis of Presentation
We currently conduct our business through one operating segment. As a pre-revenue company with no commercial operations, our activities to date have been limited. Our results are reported under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and in U.S. dollars. 
Components of Results of Operations
We are an exploration-stage company with no revenue to date and a net loss of $81.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a net loss of $73.8 million in the prior year. We have an accumulated deficit of approximately $631.4 million from inception through December 31, 2024. 
Our historical results may not be indicative of our future results for reasons that may be difficult to anticipate. Accordingly, the drivers of our future financial results, as well as the components of such results, may not be comparable to our historical or projected results of operations.
Revenue
To date, we have not generated any revenue. We do not expect to generate revenue (other than potential service revenue) until NORI receives an exploitation contract and we are able to successfully collect and process polymetallic nodules into saleable products on a commercial scale. Any revenue from initial production is difficult to predict.
Exploration and Evaluation Expenses
We expense all costs relating to exploration and development of mineral claims. Such exploration and development costs include, but are not limited to, ISA contract management, geological, geochemical and geophysical studies, environmental baseline studies, process development and payments to Allseas for the PMTS. Our exploration expenses are impacted by the amount of exploration work conducted during each period. The acquisition cost of ISA polymetallic nodule exploration contracts will be charged to operations as amortization expense on a unit-of-production method based on proven and probable reserves should commercial production commence in the future.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative (“G&A”) expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees, consultants and directors, including wages and salaries, share-based compensation, consulting fees, investor relations expenses, expenses related to advertising and marketing functions, insurance costs, office and sundry expenses, professional fees (including legal, audit and tax fees), travel expenses and transfer and filing fees.
106

Table of Contents
Share-based compensation costs from the issuance of stock options and restricted share units (“RSUs”) is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the related service period. Share-based compensation costs are charged to exploration expenses and general and administrative expenses depending on the function fulfilled by the holder of the award. In instances where an award is issued for financing related services, the costs are included within equity as part of the financing costs. We recognize forfeiture of any awards as they occur.
Interest Income/Expense
Interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents.
Fees and Interest on Borrowings and Credit Facilities
Fees and interest on borrowings and credit facilities represent interest charged on our short-term debt and interest and underutilization fees associated with our credit facilities.
Foreign Exchange Loss
The foreign exchange income or loss for the periods primarily relates to our cash held in Canadian dollars and to the settlement of costs incurred in foreign currencies, depending on either the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar.
Change in Fair Value of Warrants Liability
The change in fair value of warrants liabilities primarily consists of the change in the fair value of the 9,500,000 warrants issued to Sustainable Opportunities Holdings LLC concurrently with SOAC’s initial public offering (the “Private Warrants”). For accounting purposes, we were considered to have issued the Private Warrants as part of the Business Combination, and we are required to re-measure the fair value of our Private Warrants at the end of each reporting period.

Full Year 2024 compared to Full Year 2023
Exploration and Evaluation Expenses
Exploration and evaluation expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $50.6 million, or $0.8 million higher than the same period in 2023. The spending in 2024 as compared to the prior year reflects an increase of $7.5 million in mining, technological and process development mostly due to costs incurred for resource definition during Campaign 8, higher share-based compensation of $5.4 million primarily due to the amortization of the fair value of RSUs and options granted to officers in the second quarter of 2024. This was offset by lower spending on environmental studies as the cost for Campaign 8 which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2023 
107

Table of Contents
was completed in the first quarter of 2024 and was lower than the cost of the environmental work in 2023 following the completion of the NORI pilot nodule collection system test.
General and Administrative (“G&A”) Expenses
G&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $30.6 million compared to $22.5 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of $8.1 million in G&A expenses was mainly the result of an increase in share-based compensation of $5.7 million due to the amortization of the fair value of RSUs and options granted to directors and officers in the second quarter of 2024, higher consulting and advisory fees of $1.9 million and higher personnel costs of $0.8 million. This increase was partially offset by decreased travel and insurance costs incurred in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.
Interest Income
During 2024, we earned interest of $0.2 million, as compared to $1.3 million in 2023, mainly from the investment of our cash on hand.
Change in Fair Value of Warrants Liability
The change in fair value of warrants liability primarily consists of the change in the fair value of the 9,500,000 Private Warrants. The credit recorded in 2024 reflects the decrease in the market price of our warrants.
Fees and Interest on Borrowings and Credit Facilities
The interest charged on our short-term debt borrowings was $0.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 ($nil for the same period of 2023), while interest on drawn amounts on our credit facilities was $0.3 million and underutilization fees on these same facilities was $2.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 ($nil and $0.8 million over the same period in 2023, respectively).
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary sources of financing have come from private placements and public offerings of Common Shares and warrants, and the issuance of convertible debentures. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash on hand of $3.5 million.
In light of the significant deficit in expected funding following the closing of the Business Combination in September 2021, we adopted what we call a “capital-light” strategy whereby we removed any allocation of funds to capital expenditures that were not deemed necessary to support the submission of an application for an exploitation contract for the NORI Area D, and by negotiating the settlement of program expenditures with our equity whenever possible, and by utilizing existing assets for offshore and onshore production.
We have yet to generate any revenue from our business operations. We are an exploration-stage company and the recovery of our investment in mineral exploration contracts and attainment of profitable operations is dependent upon many factors including, among other things, the development of a commercial production system for collecting polymetallic nodules from the seafloor as well as the development of our processing technology for the metallurgical treatment of such nodules, the establishment of mineable reserves, the demonstration of commercial and technical feasibility of seafloor polymetallic nodule collection and processing systems, metal prices, and securing ISA exploitation contracts or provisional approvals. While we have obtained financing in the past, there is no assurance that such financing will continue to be available on favorable terms, in sufficient amounts, or at all.
We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future, particularly as we advance towards our application to the ISA for an exploitation contract and preparation for potential commercialization. Based on our cash balance and availability of borrowing under our credit facility with ERAS Capital LLC and Gerard Barron, when compared with our forecasted cash expenditures, we believe we will have sufficient funds to meet our obligations that become due within the next twelve months. Our estimates used in reaching this conclusion are based on information available as at the date of filing this Annual Report. Accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates and resulting variances may result in our need for additional funding in an amount greater or earlier than expected, due to changes in business conditions or other developments, including, but not limited to, deferral of approvals, capital and operating cost escalation, currently unrecognized technical and development challenges, our ability to pay certain vendors or suppliers in our Common Shares or changes in external business environment.

In addition, we will however need and are seeking additional financing to fund our continued operations over time. These financings could include additional public or private equity, debt financings, equity-linked financings or other sources of financing, including through non-dilutive asset, royalty or project-based and/or asset-based financings. If these financing or other financing sources are not available, or if the terms of financing are less desirable than we expect, or if in insufficient amounts, we may be forced to delay our exploration and/or exploitation activities or further scale back our operations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial prospects.
On September 16, 2022, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which the SEC declared effective on October 14, 2022, to sell up to $100 million of securities, which includes the $30 million that may be sold under the At-the-Market Equity Distribution Agreement discussed below and the Common Shares and shares underlying the Class A Warrants issued in the Registered Direct Offering. In addition, on November 30, 2023, we filed an additional registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which the SEC declared effective on December 8, 2023, to sell up to an additional $100 million of securities. Securities that may be sold under the registration statements include common shares, preferred shares, debt securities, warrants and units. Any such offering, if it does occur, may happen in one or more transactions. Specific terms of any securities to be sold will be described in supplemental filings with the SEC.
On December 22, 2022, we entered into an At-the-Market Equity Distribution Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated (“Stifel”) and Wedbush Securities Inc., as sales agents, allowing us, from time to time, to issue and sell Common Shares with an aggregate offering price of up to $30 million. On December 21, 2023, we amended the Sales Agreement to remove Stifel as a sales agent. The offer and sales of the shares are made under our effective “shelf” registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on September 16, 2022, which the SEC declared effective on October 14, 2022. No funds were raised from the Sales Agreement in the fourth quarter of 2024, while for the 2024 year, we sold 3,251,590 Common Shares for gross proceeds of $4.9 million under this offering.
On March 22, 2023, we entered into the 2023 Credit Facility with Argentum Cedit Virtuti GCV, the parent of Allseas Investments S.A. and an affiliate of Allseas, which was amended on July 31, 2023 and March 22, 2024, pursuant to which, we were able to borrow from the Lender up to $25 million in the aggregate, from time to time, subject to certain conditions. All amounts drawn under the 2023 Credit Facility bore interest at the 6-month SOFR, 180-day average plus 4.0% per annum payable in cash semi-annually (or plus 5% if paid-in-kind at maturity, our election) on the first business day of each of June and January. We agreed to pay an underutilization fee equal to 4.0% per annum payable semi-annually for any amounts that remain undrawn under the 2023 Credit Facility. We had the right to pre-pay the entire amount outstanding under the 2023 Credit Facility at any time, before the 2023 Credit Facility’s stated maturity of August 31, 2025. The 2023 Credit Facility also contained customary events of default. No amounts had been drawn under the 2023 Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement we entered into on March 24, 2025, we and Argentum Cedit Virtuti GCV agreed to cancel the 2023 Credit Facility with no outstanding amounts remaining, other than our obligation to pay the underutilization fee thereunder.
On August 14, 2023, we entered into a securities purchase agreement for a Registered Direct Offering of our Common Shares and Class A Warrants (the “2023 Offering”). The purchase price for each Common Share and Class A Warrant to purchase 0.5 Common Shares was $2.00 per unit. The exercise price to purchase one Common Share under the Class A Warrants is $3.00, subject to adjustment as provided in the warrant agreement. No investor elected to exercise its right to purchase additional Common Shares and accompanying Class A Warrants on or before September 15, 2023 under the terms of the securities purchase agreement. As of December 31, 2023, we had received gross proceeds of $15.9 million (approximately $14.6 million net of transaction fees) in the Registered Direct Offering. We received the remaining $9 million of gross proceeds on January 31, 2024, from an investor affiliated with us. As a result of the 2024 Purchase Agreement (as described below), the exercise price of the Class A Warrants was reset to $2.00 as the down round feature of the Class A Warrants agreement was triggered.
On March 22, 2024, we entered into the 2024 Credit Facility with Gerard Barron, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and ERAS Capital LLC, the family fund of our director, Andrei Karkar, pursuant to which, we may borrow from the 2024 Lenders up to $25 million in the aggregate ($12.5 million from each of the 2024 Lenders), from time to time (was initially $20 million in the aggregate ($10 million from each of the 2024 Lenders), subject to certain conditions. All amounts drawn under the 2024 Credit Facility will bear interest at the 6-month SOFR, 180-day average plus 4.0% per annum payable in cash semi-annually (or plus 5% if paid-in-kind at maturity, at our election) on the first business day of each of June and January. We will pay an underutilization fee equal to 4.0% per annum payable semi-annually for any amounts that remain undrawn under the 2024 Credit Facility. We have the right to pre-pay the entire amount outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility at any time, before the 2024 Credit Facility’s maturity of December 31, 2025. 
109

Table of Contents
The 2024 Credit Facility also contains customary events of default. The 2024 Credit Facility will terminate automatically if we or any of our subsidiaries raise at least $50 million in the aggregate (i) through the issuance of any of our or our subsidiaries’ debt or equity securities, or (ii) in prepayments under an off-take agreement or similar commercial agreement. On August 13, 2024, we entered into the First Amendment to the 2024 Credit Facility to increase the borrowing limit to $25 million in the aggregate ($12.5 million from each of the 2024 Lenders). Under the terms of the First Amendment, the borrowing limit was due to return to the initial $20 million in the aggregate ($10 million from each of the 2024 Lenders) upon certain financing events. On November 14, 2024, we entered into the Second Amendment to the 2024 Credit Facility with ERAS Capital LLC and Gerard Barron, to increase the borrowing limit to $38 million in the aggregate ($19 million from each of the 2024 Lenders) and to extend the maturity of the 2024 Credit Facility to December 31, 2025. As per the Second Amendment, the rate of underutilization fee was retroactively increased from 4% to 6.5% on any undrawn amounts under the 2024 Credit Facility. On January 30, 2025, we repaid $1.8 million from the drawn amount, leaving a balance of $2.5 million drawn under the 2024 Credit Facility, as of the date of this Annual Report. With the January 2025 repayment, the borrowing limit on the 2024 Credit Facility was reduced to $36.2 million ($17.2 million from Gerard Barron and $19 million from ERAS Capital LLC). On March 26, 2025, we entered into the Third Amendment to the 2024 Credit Facility with the 2024 Lenders, to, among other things, increase the borrowing limit to $44 million in the aggregate ($22 million from each of the 2024 Lenders) and extend the maturity of the 2024 Credit Facility to June 30, 2026.
On May 27, 2024, we entered into a short-term loan agreement with the Lender (Argentum Cedit Virtuti GCV), an affiliate of Allseas. In accordance with the agreement, the Lender provided a short-term loan amounting to $2 million (the “Loan”) on May 30, 2024. The Loan takes priority over the 2024 Credit Facility. The Loan matured on September 10, 2024 (maturity date) and accrued interest at a rate of 8% per annum. On the maturity date, Company repaid the entire Loan amounting to $2 million and the accrued interest amounting to $46 thousand.
On September 9, 2024, we entered into a Working Capital Loan Agreement with Allseas Investments, a company related to Allseas. In accordance with the Working Capital Loan Agreement, Allseas Investments provided a loan to us amounting to $5 million (the “Working Capital Loan”) on September 10, 2024, to be used towards general corporate purposes and the repayment of all outstanding amounts under the Short-Term Loan between us and the Lender. The Working Capital Loan is payable to the Lender on or before the earlier of (i) the occurrence of certain financing events and (ii) April 1, 2025 (the “Repayment Date”). The Working Capital Loan will bear interest based on the 6-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate, 180-day average plus a margin of 4.0% per annum and is payable in two installments on January 2, 2025, and the Repayment Date (or plus a margin of 5.0% if all interest payments are deferred to the Repayment Date, at our election). On October 18, 2024, we entered into the First Amendment to the Working Capital Loan Agreement with Allseas Investments, resulting in a further draw of $2.5 million by us and a total Working Capital Loan drawn amount of $7.5 million.

On March 24, 2025, we entered into the Letter Agreement with Allseas Investments and Argentum Cedit Virtuti GCV, pursuant to which the repayment date under the Working Capital Loan Agreement was extended to September 30, 2025.
On November 14, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “2024 Purchase Agreement”) with certain new and existing institutional investors for the sale of an aggregate of 17,500,000 common shares (the “Shares”) and accompanying Class B warrants (the “Class B Warrants”), in a registered direct offering. The offering price was $1.00 per Share, with each Share including an accompanying Class B Warrant to purchase 0.5 common shares. The Class B Warrants are exercisable immediately upon issuance at a price of $2.00 per share and expire five years from issuance. On November 26, 2024, we entered into the First Amendment to the 2024 Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to sell and issue an additional 2,400,000 common shares and accompanying Class B Warrants to purchase 1,200,000 common shares to new investors on the same terms and conditions as initially offered. Including the First Amendment to the 2024 Purchase Agreement, we agreed to sell and issue in aggregate 19,900,000 common shares and Class B Warrants to purchase 9,950,000 common shares. Pursuant to the 2024 Purchase Agreement, we agreed not to issue any Common Shares or Common Share equivalents with an effective price of less than $1.00 per share until May 18, 2025. As at December 31, 2024, we received gross proceeds of $14.9 million (net proceeds of $14.2 million, after offering expenses), with the final $5 million of gross proceeds received on February 6, 2025.
We may receive up to approximately $309.1 million in aggregate gross proceeds from cash exercises of the Public Warrants, the Private Warrants, the Class A Warrants and the Class B Warrants, based on the per share exercise price of such warrants. However, the exercise price for the outstanding Public Warrants and Private Warrants is $11.50 per common share and there can be no assurance that such warrants will be in the money prior to their expiration, and as such, such warrants may expire worthless. Based on the current trading price of our Common Shares we do not expect to receive any proceeds from the exercise of the Public Warrants and Private Warrants unless there is a significant increase in the price of our Common Shares. In certain circumstances, the Public Warrants and Private Warrants may be exercised on a cashless basis and the proceeds from the exercise of such warrants will decrease. Furthermore, 
110

Table of Contents
even if the warrants will be in the money, the holders of the warrants are not obligated to exercise their warrants, and we cannot predict whether holders of the warrants will choose to exercise all or any of their warrants. In addition, the exercise price to purchase one Common Share under the outstanding Class A Warrants and Class B Warrants is $2.00 (subject to customary adjustments) and there can be no assurance that such warrants will be exercised prior to their expiration, and as such, such warrants may expire and we will not receive any proceeds from the excise thereof.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments
NORI Exploration Contract
As part of the NORI Exploration Contract with the ISA, NORI submitted a periodic review report to the ISA which included a five-year plan covering 2022 to 2026: NORI is currently implementing its approved five-year plan. The cost of the estimated work plan for 2025 onwards is dependent on the ISA’s approval of the NORI Area D exploitation application. Should the approval of NORI’s exploitation application for NORI Area D be delayed or rejected, NORI intends to revise its estimated future work plan in respect of its NORI Area. Work plans are reviewed annually by us, agreed with the ISA and may be subject to change depending on our progress to date. NORI’s exploration contract expires on July 21, 2026. NORI is required to submit an application for extension no later than six months before the expiration of the contract. NORI intends to submit an application for a five-year extension in 2025.
TOML Exploration Contract
As part of the TOML Exploration Contract with the ISA, TOML submitted a periodic review report to the ISA which included a five-year plan covering 2022 to 2026: TOML is currently implementing its approved plan, which included an estimated five-year expenditure of up to $44 million. The five-year estimated expenditure is indicative and subject to change, TOML will review the program regularly and TOML will inform the ISA of any changes through its annual reports.
Regulatory Obligations Relating to Exploration Contracts
Both TOML and NORI require sponsorship from their host sponsoring nations, Tonga and Nauru, respectively. Each company has been registered and incorporated within the applicable host nation’s jurisdiction. The ISA requires that a contractor must obtain and maintain sponsorship by a host nation that is a member of the ISA, and such state must maintain effective supervision and regulatory control over such sponsored contractor. Each of TOML and NORI is subject to the registration and incorporation requirements of these nations. In the event the sponsorship is otherwise terminated, such subsidiary will be required to obtain new sponsorship from another state that is a member of the ISA. Failure to obtain such new sponsorship would have a material impact on the operations of such subsidiary and us.
Sponsorship Agreements
On July 5, 2017, Nauru, the Nauru Seabed Minerals Authority and NORI entered into the NORI Sponsorship Agreement formalizing certain obligations of the parties in relation to NORI’s exploration and potential exploitation of the NORI Area. Upon reaching the minimum recovery level within the exploitation contract area, NORI will pay Nauru a seabed mineral recovery payment based on the polymetallic nodules recovered from the exploitation contract area. In addition, NORI will pay an administration fee each year to Nauru for such administration and sponsorship, which is subject to review and increase in the event NORI is granted an ISA exploitation contract. NORI has begun discussions with the Government of Nauru to renegotiate the existing sponsorship agreement and has also committed to ensuring NORI pays corporate income tax within Nauru, assuming our future operations are ultimately profitable. 
On March 8, 2008, Tonga and TOML entered into the TOML Sponsorship Agreement formalizing certain obligations of the parties in relation to TOML’s exploration and potential exploitation of the TOML Area. On September 23, 2021, Tonga updated the TOML Sponsorship Agreement harmonizing the terms of its engagement with TOML with those held by NORI with Nauru. TOML expects to renegotiate the existing sponsorship agreement with Tonga prior to entering into operations in the TOML Area and has committed to paying corporate income tax within Tonga, assuming our future operations are ultimately profitable.
Allseas Agreements
On March 29, 2019, we entered into a strategic alliance with Allseas to develop a system to collect, lift and transport nodules from the seafloor to shore and agreed to enter into a nodule collection and shipping agreement whereby Allseas would provide commercial services for the collection of the first 200 million metric tonnes of polymetallic nodules on a cost plus 50% profit basis. In furtherance of this agreement, on July 8, 2019, we entered into a Pilot Mining Test Agreement with Allseas (“PMTA”), which was amended on five 
112

Table of Contents
occasions through February 2023, to develop and deploy a PMTS, successful completion of which is a prerequisite for our application for an exploitation contract with the ISA. Under the PMTA, Allseas agreed to cover the development cost of the project in exchange for a payment from us upon successful completion of the pilot trial of the PMTS in NORI Area D.
On March 16, 2022, NORI and Allseas entered into a non-binding term sheet for the development and operation of a commercial nodule collection system. The pilot nodule collection system developed and tested by Allseas is expected to be upgraded to a commercial system with an expanded targeted production capacity of up to an estimated 3.0 million tonnes of wet nodules per year, to be delivered in stepped increments. NORI and Allseas intend to equally finance all costs related to developing and getting the first commercial system into production. Once in production, NORI is expected to pay Allseas a nodule collection and transshipment fee and, as Allseas scales up production to up to an estimated 3.0 million wet tonnes of nodules per year, it is expected that unit costs will be reduced. Following the successful completion of the NORI Area D pilot collection system trials in November 2022 and subsequent analysis of pilot data, the parties are reviewing Project Zero Offshore Nodule Collection System production targets, system design and cost estimates and intend to enter into a binding Heads of Terms by the end of 2024. The parties expect to further detail their relationship in three separate definitive agreements for engineering, conversion/build and commercial operations phase, respectively. Subject to the necessary regulatory approvals, Allseas and NORI also intend to investigate acquiring a second production vessel similar to the 
Hidden Gem
, another Samsung 10000, with the potential for an additional production rate of three million tonnes of wet nodules per year and lower associated per tonne production cost. There can be no assurances, however, that we will enter into definitive agreements with Allseas contemplated by the non-binding term sheet in a particular time period, or at all, or on terms similar to those set forth in the non-binding term sheet, or that if such definitive agreements are entered into by us that the proposed commercial systems and second production vessel will be successfully developed or operated in a particular time period, or at all.
Through December 31, 2024, we have made the following payments to Allseas under the PMTA: (a) $10 million in cash in February 2020, (b) $10 million through the issuance of 3.2 million Common Shares valued at $3.11 per share in February 2020, (c) issued Allseas a warrant to purchase 11.6 million Common Shares at a nominal exercise price per share in March 2021, (d) $10 million in cash in October 2021, following the closing of the Business Combination and meeting certain progress targets on the PMTS and (e) on February 23, 2023 issued 10.85 million Common Shares to Allseas. On August 9, 2023, 11,578,620 common shares were issued to Allseas upon the exercise of the warrant that was granted to Allseas in March 2021, and receipt of the exercise fee of $115.8 thousand. The warrant vested and became exercisable on successful completion of the PMTS in November 2022.
On November 11, 2022, our board of directors approved the successful completion and testing of the PMTS in the NORI Area D and payment of the third milestone amounting to $10 million and additional costs owed to Allseas under the PMTA by issuing 10.85 million Common Shares to Allseas priced at $1.00 per share on February 23, 2023.
On August 1, 2023, we entered into an Exclusive Vessel Use Agreement with Allseas pursuant to which Allseas will give us exclusive use of the vessel (“
Hidden Gem
”) in support of the development of the Project Zero Offshore Nodule Collection System until the system is completed or December 31, 2026, whichever is earlier. In consideration of the exclusivity term, on August 14, 2023, we issued 4.15 million Common Shares to Allseas.
Offtake Agreement
On May 25, 2012, DGE and Glencore entered into a copper offtake agreement and a nickel offtake agreement. DGE has agreed to deliver to Glencore 50% of the annual quantity of copper and nickel produced by a DGE-owned facility from nodules derived from the NORI Area at London Metal Exchange referenced market pricing with allowances for product quality and delivery location. Either party may terminate the agreement upon a material breach or insolvency of the other party. Glencore may also terminate the agreement by giving twelve months’ notice.
Borrowing with Company Related to Allseas
2023 Credit Facility
As described above, on March 22, 2023, we entered into the 2023 Credit Facility with Argentum Cedit Virtuti GCV, an affiliate of Allseas, under which we may borrow up to $25.0 million pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 2023 Credit Facility, as amended, which has a maturity date of August 31, 2025. On August 16, 2024, we entered into the Third Amendment to the 2023 Credit Facility, to increase the borrowing limit of the 2023 Credit Facility to $27.5 million. Under the terms of the Third Amendment, upon closing of 
113

Table of Contents
the November 2024 Registered Direct Offering discussed above, the borrowing limit returned to $25 million. There was no outstanding balance under the 2023 Credit Facility as at December 31, 2024. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement entered into on March 24, 2025, we agreed to cancel the 2023 Credit Facility with no outstanding amounts remaining, other than our obligation to pay Argentum Cedit Virtuti GCV the underutilization fee thereunder.
2024 Short-Term Loan and Working Capital Loan
On May 27, 2024, we entered into a short-term loan agreement with Argentum Cedit Virtuti GCV whereby we borrowed $2 million (the “Loan”) on May 30, 2024. The Loan matured on September 10, 2024 (maturity date) and accrued interest at a rate of 8% per annum. On the maturity date, we repaid the entire Loan amounting to $2 million and the accrued interest.
On September 9, 2024, we entered into a working capital loan agreement (the “Working Capital Loan Agreement”) with Allseas Investments, a company related to Allseas. In accordance with the Working Capital Loan Agreement, Allseas Investments provided a loan to us amounting to $5 million (the “Working Capital Loan”) on September 10, 2024, to be used towards general corporate purposes and the repayment of all outstanding amounts under the Short-Term Loan between us and the Lender. The Working Capital Loan is payable to the Lender on or before the earlier of (i) the occurrence of certain financing events and (ii) April 1, 2025 (the “Original Repayment Date”). The Working Capital Loan will bear interest based on the 6-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate, 180-day average plus a margin of 4.0% per annum and is payable in two installments on January 2, 2025, and the Original Repayment Date (or plus a margin of 5.0% if all interest payments are deferred to the Original Repayment Date, at our election). On October 18, 2024, we entered into the First Amendment to the Working Capital Loan Agreement with Allseas Investments, resulting in a further draw of $2.5 million by us and a total Working Capital Loan drawn amount of $7.5 million. On March 24, 2025, we entered into a Letter Agreement with Allseas Investments and Argentum Cedit Virtuti GCV, pursuant to which the Original Repayment Date under the Working Capital Loan Agreement was extended to September 30, 2025, with principal and interest now repayable on that date.
2024 Credit Facility with ERAS Capital LLC and Gerard Barron
On March 22, 2024, we entered into an Unsecured Credit Facility with Gerard Barron, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and ERAS Capital LLC, the family fund of our director, Andrei Karkar, pursuant to which, we may borrow from the 2024 Lenders up to $25 million in the aggregate ($12.5 million from each of the 2024 Lenders), from time to time, subject to certain conditions. All amounts drawn under the 2024 Credit Facility will bear interest at the 6-month SOFR, 180-day average plus 4.0% per annum payable in cash semi-annually (or plus 5% if paid-in-kind at maturity, at our election) on the first business day of each of June and January. We will pay an underutilization fee equal to 4.0% per annum payable semi-annually for any amounts that remain undrawn under the 2024 Credit Facility. We have the right to pre-pay the entire amount outstanding under the 2024 Credit Facility at any time, before the 2024 Credit Facility’s maturity of December 31, 2025. The 2024 Credit Facility also contains customary events of default. The 2024 Credit Facility will terminate automatically if we or any of our subsidiaries raise at least $50 million in the aggregate (i) through the issuance of any of our or our subsidiaries’ debt or equity securities, or (ii) in prepayments under an off-take agreement or similar commercial agreement. On August 13, 2024, we entered into the First Amendment to the 2024 Credit Facility with the 2024 Lenders, to increase the borrowing limit of the 2024 Credit Facility to $25 million in the aggregate ($12.5 million from each of the 2024 Lenders). On November 14, 2024, we entered into the Second Amendment to increase the borrowing limit to $38 million in the aggregate ($19 million from each of the 2024 Lenders) to the 2024 Credit Facility with ERAS Capital LLC and Gerard Barron, and to extend the maturity of the 2024 Credit Facility to December 31, 2025. As per the Second Amendment, the rate of underutilization fee was retroactively increased from March 22, 2024 to 6.5% on any undrawn amounts under the 2024 Credit Facility. On March 26, 2025, we entered into the Third Amendment to, among other things,increase the borrowing limit to $44 million in the aggregate ($22 million from each of the 2024 Lenders) and extend the maturity of the 2024 Credit Facility to June 30, 2026.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we have drawn $4.3 million from the 2024 Credit Facility and incurred $0.2 million as interest expense. During 2024, we incurred $1.1 million, as underutilization fees, which would be payable only in the event the 2024 Credit Facility is not drawn down at the time such fees are payable. During 2024, we repaid interest amounting to $25 thousand, and underutilization fees amounting to $0.1 million to the 2024 Lenders. On January 31, 2025, we repaid the drawn amount and outstanding interest on the 2024 Credit Facility amounting to $1.8 million and $0.1 million, respectively.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In the preparation of these financial statements, we are required to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods.
We consider an accounting judgment, estimate or assumption to be critical when (1) the estimate or assumption is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment and (2) the use of different judgments, estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. We have the critical accounting policies and estimates which are described below.
Value of Common Share-Based Payments
We recognize the cost of share-based awards granted to employees and directors based on the estimated grant-date fair value of the awards. We determine the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is impacted by the following assumptions:
●
Fair Value of Common Shares on the Date of the Grant — We used the price of the most recent offerings of our Common Shares to assess the value of our shares on the date of the grant of incentive stock options.
●
Expected Term — We used the term of the award when calculating the expected term due to insufficient historical exercise data.
●
Expected Volatility — As our Common Shares were not actively traded, the volatility is based on a benchmark of comparable companies within the mining industry.
●
Expected Dividend Yield — The dividend rate used is zero as we have never paid any cash dividends on our Common Shares and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future.
●
Risk-Free Interest Rate — The interest rates used are based on the implied yield available on Canadian Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award.
This valuation approach involves the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are subjective, such as those regarding the probability of future events. Changes in these estimates and assumptions impact our valuation as of the valuation date and may have a material impact on the valuation of our Common Shares. Changes in these assumptions used to determine the fair value of incentive stock options, including the vesting timeline of granted stock options, could have a material impact on our loss and comprehensive loss.
Valuation of Warrants Liability
We re-measure the fair value of the Private Warrants at the end of each reporting period. The fair value of the Private Warrants is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model whereby the expected volatility is estimated by using a blended volatility calculated by assigning equal weights to both implied volatility of our Public Warrants and the historical volatility of our common share price. The expected volatility was estimated using a binomial model based on consideration of the implied volatility from our Public Warrants, adjusted to account for the call feature of the Public Warrants at prices above $18.00 during 20 trading days within any 30-trading-day period and historical volatility of the share price of our Common Shares.
Evaluation of Going Concern
We assess quarterly whether we have the ability to meet its committed cash requirements for the next twelve months and continue to operate as a going concern. This assessment requires the use of forecasts of our business activities and related estimates of future cost obligations which can be subject to change. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our assessment and related disclosures.

Table of Contents
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information about recent accounting pronouncements, the timing of their adoption, and our assessment, to the extent we have made one, of their potential impact on our financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows.
Emerging Growth Company Status
Section 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (“JOBS”) Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can choose not to take advantage of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies, and any such election to not take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable.
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act and have elected to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period for new or revised financial accounting standards. Following the closing of the Business Combination, we expect to remain an emerging growth company at least through the end of the 2025 fiscal year and we expect to continue to take advantage of the benefits of the extended transition period at least through the end of the 2025 fiscal year, although we may decide to early adopt such new or revised accounting standards to the extent permitted by such standards. This may make it difficult or impossible to compare our financial results with the financial results of another public company that is either not an emerging growth company or is an emerging growth company that has chosen not to take advantage of the extended transition period exemptions because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.

Item 7A.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to a variety of markets and other risks including the effects of change in interest rates, inflation and foreign currency translation and transaction risks as well as risks to the availability of funding sources, hazard events specific asset risks, regulatory risks, public policy risks and technology risks. We also expect to be exposed to commodity risks if and when we commence commercial production.
Interest Rate Risk and Credit Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of our future cash flows and our financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
Our current practice is to invest excess cash in investment-grade short-term deposit certificates issued by reputable Canadian financial institutions with which we keep our bank accounts and management believes the risk of loss to be remote. We periodically monitor the investments we make and are satisfied with the credit ratings of our banks. Due to the current high cash need of our operating plan, we have kept our funds readily available, placed in secure, highly liquid interest-bearing investments, as at December 31, 2024.
Credit risk is a risk of loss that may arise on outstanding financial instruments should a counter party default on its obligation. Our receivables consist primarily of general sales tax due from the Federal Government of Canada and as a result, the risk of default is considered to be low. Once we commence commercial production, we expect our credit risk to rise with our increased customer base.
Foreign Currency Risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Our exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates our transactions in foreign currencies, primarily in the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Great British Pound and the Euro. We primarily hold our cash in U.S. dollars and settle our foreign currency payables soon after the receipt of invoices thereby minimizing the foreign currency exposure.
Once we commence commercial production, we expect to be exposed to both currency transaction and translation risk. To date, we have not had material exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and have not hedged such exposure, although we may do so in the future.
Commodity Price Risk
We expect to engage in the collection, transport, processing and sale of products containing nickel, copper, manganese and cobalt from the polymetallic nodules collected from our contract areas of the CCZ. Accordingly, we expect the principal source of future revenue to be the sale of products containing nickel, copper, manganese and cobalt. A significant and sustained decrease in the price of these metals from current levels could have a material and negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of TMC the metals company Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of TMC the metals company Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of loss and comprehensive loss, changes in equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the “PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

​
1.
Nature of Operations
TMC the metals company Inc. (“TMC” or the “Company”) has been operating as a corporation under the laws of the province of British Columbia, Canada since September 9, 2021. The Company’s corporate office, registered address and records office is located at 1111 West Hastings Street, 15
th
 Floor, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6E 2J3. The Company’s common shares and warrants to purchase common shares are listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under tickers “TMC” and “TMCWW”, respectively.
The Company is a deep-sea minerals exploration company focused on the collection and processing of polymetallic nodules found on the seafloor in international waters of the Clarion Clipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean (“CCZ”), located approximately 1,300 nautical miles southwest of San Diego, California. These nodules contain four metals (nickel, copper, cobalt, manganese) which can be used as (i) feedstock for battery cathode precursors (nickel and cobalt sulfates, or intermediary nickel-copper-cobalt matte, or nickel-copper-cobalt alloy) for electric vehicles (“EV”) and energy storage markets, (ii) copper cathode for EV wiring, energy transmission and other applications and (iii) manganese silicate for manganese alloy production required for steel production.
Exploration and exploitation of seabed minerals in international waters is regulated by the International Seabed Authority (“ISA”), an intergovernmental organization established pursuant to the 1994 Agreement Relating to the Implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The ISA grants contracts to sovereign states or to private contractors who are sponsored by a sovereign state. The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. (“NORI”), was granted an exploration contract (the “NORI Exploration Contract”) by the ISA in July 2011 under the sponsorship of the Republic of Nauru (“Nauru”) giving NORI exclusive rights to explore for polymetallic nodules in an area covering 
74,830
 square kilometers

in the CCZ (“NORI Area”). On March 31, 2020, the Company acquired Tonga Offshore Mining Limited (“TOML”), which was granted an exploration contract (the “TOML Exploration Contract”) by the ISA in January 2012 under the sponsorship of the Kingdom of Tonga (“Tonga”) and has exclusive rights to explore for polymetallic nodules covering an area of 
74,713
 square kilometers in the CCZ (“TOML Area”). In 2013, the Company through its subsidiary DeepGreen Engineering Pte. Ltd. (“DGE”) entered into an option agreement (the “Marawa Option Agreement”) with Marawa Research and Exploration Limited (“Marawa”) which granted DGE exclusive rights to manage and carry out all exploration and exploitation in the Marawa Area in return for a royalty payable to Marawa. On November 14, 2024, DGE issued a formal termination notice to Marawa pursuant to DGE’s right to terminate for convenience under the Agreement. The termination became effective on January 14, 2025.
The realization of the Company’s assets and attainment of profitable operations is dependent upon many factors including, among other things: financing being arranged by the Company to continue operations, development of a nodule collection system for the recovery of polymetallic nodules from the seafloor as well as development of processing technology for the treatment of polymetallic nodules at commercial scale, the establishment of mineable reserves, the commercial and technical feasibility of seafloor polymetallic nodule collection and processing, metal prices, and regulatory approvals and environmental permitting for commercial operations. The outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined because they are contingent on future events and may not be fully under the Company’s control.

3.
Significant Accounting Policies
i.
Foreign Currencies
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The functional currency of the Company and all its subsidiaries is the U.S. Dollar.
At the end of each reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar are translated at rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated. All gains and losses on translation of these foreign currency transactions are included in the statements of loss and comprehensive loss.  
ii.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. Significant estimates and assumptions 
125

Table of Contents
TMC the metals company Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands of US Dollars, except share, per share amounts and unless otherwise stated)
​
reflected in these consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the evaluation of going concern, the valuation of share-based payments, including valuation of incentive stock options (Note 17), as well as the valuation of warrants liability (Note 15), and the valuation of the royalty liability (Note 9). Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
iii.
Loss Per Share
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. The computation of diluted loss per share assumes the conversion, exercise or contingent issuance of securities only when such conversion, exercise or issuance would have a dilutive effect on the loss per share. The dilutive effect of convertible securities is reflected in the diluted loss per share by application of the “if converted” method. The dilutive effect of outstanding options and their equivalents is reflected in the diluted loss per share by application of the treasury stock method.
iv.
Financial Instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash flows from the assets have expired, or have been transferred, and the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled, or expires.
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, short-term debt, accounts payable and accrued liabilities which are recorded at cost as well as royalty liability and warrants to acquire common shares of the Company which are measured at fair value.
v.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value estimates of financial instruments are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant information about financial markets and specific financial instruments. As these estimates are subjective in nature, involving uncertainties and matters of significant judgment, they cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions can significantly affect estimated fair value.
The Company measures fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company utilizes a three-tier hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:
●
Level 1
 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that an entity has the ability to access.
●
Level 2
 - Valuations based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
●
Level 3
 - Valuations based on inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
In some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
There were 
no
 transfers between fair value measurement levels during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
126

Table of Contents
TMC the metals company Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands of US Dollars, except share, per share amounts and unless otherwise stated)
​
As at December 31, 2024, and 2023, the carrying values of cash, receivables, short-term debt, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The financial instruments also include royalty liability and warrants which are recorded at fair value as disclosed in Note 9.
vi.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash includes cash on hand and term deposits with a remaining term to maturity at acquisition of three months or less. As at December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had 
no
 cash equivalents.
vii.
Equipment and Software
Equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, when it is probable that future economic benefits from such assets will flow to the Company and the cost of such assets can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of an asset is derecognized when it is replaced or taken out of service. Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the statement of loss and comprehensive loss during the period they are incurred.
The major categories of equipment are amortized on a declining balance basis as follows:
​
​
​
​
​
Exploration and other equipment

30
%
Office equipment

30
%
​
The Company allocates the amount initially recognized to each asset’s significant components and depreciates each component separately. Amortization methods and useful life of the assets are reviewed at each financial period end and adjusted on a prospective basis, if required.
Gains and losses on disposals of equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount of the asset and are included in the statement of loss and comprehensive loss.
Software is currently under development and is stated at cost. The software will be used to monitor nodule collection on the sea floor. The Company will amortize the cost of the software over its useful life after it is put in use, on commencement of nodule collection and treatment at a commercial scale.
viii.
Exploration Contracts
The Company is in the exploration stage with respect to its investment in exploration contracts and follows the practice of capitalizing costs related to the acquisition of such exploration contracts. The cost of exploration contracts will be charged to operations using a unit-of-production method based on proven and probable reserves once commercial production commences in the future. The Company evaluates impairment indicators on its exploration contracts at each reporting period and adjusts its carrying value if an impairment is identified.
ix.
Exploration and Evaluation Expenses
While in the exploration phase, the Company expenses all costs related to exploration and development of exploration contracts. Such exploration and development costs include, but are not limited to, exploration contract management, geological, geochemical and geophysical studies, environmental studies and process development.

​
x.
Share-Based Compensation
Share-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period. Share-based compensation costs are charged to exploration and evaluation expenses or general and administrative expenses in the statement of loss and comprehensive loss. The Company recognizes forfeiture of any awards as they occur. The Company records share-based compensation from the issuance of stock options and restricted share units (“RSUs”) to employees with service-based conditions using the accelerated attribution method.
For stock options and restricted share units issued with performance conditions (Note 17), the Company recognizes share-based compensation cost when the specific performance targets become probable of being achieved using the accelerated attribution method. When these costs relate to equity financing, they are netted against share capital as a share issuance cost. The fair value of stock option awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
For stock options and restricted share units issued with market conditions (Note 17), the Company recognizes share-based compensation cost over the expected achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on the grant date. If the related market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected achievement period, then any unamortized share-based compensation cost for that milestone is recognized at that time. The fair value of market-based stock option awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte-Carlo simulations.
The Company at times grants common shares, stock options or RSUs in lieu of cash to certain vendors for their services to the Company. The Company recognizes the associated cost in the same period and manner as if the Company paid cash for the services provided.
xi.
Warrants Liability
The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including issued share purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to U.S. GAAP Accounting Standard Coding (“ASC”) 480, Distinguishing Liability from Equity (“ASC 480”), and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period.
The Company accounts for the Public Warrants and Private Warrants (as defined below) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 815 (Subtopic 40), Derivative and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (“ASC 815-40”), and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Division of Corporation Finance’s April 12, 2021 Public Statement, Staff Statement on Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants Issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (“SEC Statement”), under which the 
15,000,000
 common share warrants issued by the Company as part of the units offered in its initial public offering (“Public Warrants”) were determined to meet the criteria for equity classification, while the 
9,500,000
 private placement common share warrants issued by the Company in a private placement simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering (“Private Warrants”) did not meet the criteria for equity classification and were recorded as liabilities. Specifically, the terms of the Private Warrants provide for potential changes to the settlement amounts dependent upon the characteristics of the warrant holder, and, because the holder of a Private Warrant is not an input into the pricing of a fixed-for-fixed option on equity shares, such provision would preclude the Private Warrants from being classified in equity and should be classified as a liability. Accordingly, the Company classified the Private Warrants as liabilities measured at fair value and adjusts the Private Warrants to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. Fair value changes in the Private Warrants are recognized in the Company’s statement of loss and comprehensive loss.
The Company issued Class A Warrants and Class B Warrants in 2024. The Class A Warrants and Class B Warrants met the criteria for equity classification and were recorded under additional paid in capital (Note 15).

Income Taxes
Income tax expense represents the sum of current tax expense and deferred tax expense. 
Current tax expense is based on taxable profit for the year and includes any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous years. Taxable profit differs from accounting profit or loss as reported in the consolidated income statement because it excludes (i) items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and (ii) items that are never taxable or deductible. The Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted by the balance sheet date. The Company’s policy is to account for income tax related interest and penalties in income tax expense in the accompanying statements of loss and comprehensive loss.
Deferred tax income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on temporary differences, which are differences between the accounting basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities, non-capital loss, capital loss, and tax credits carryforwards and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws expected to apply when these differences reverse. Deferred tax benefits, including non-capital loss, capital loss, and tax credit carryforwards are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is considered more likely than not. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated income statement in the period that enactment occurs. When realization of deferred income tax assets does not meet the more likely than not criterion for recognition, a valuation allowance is provided.
xiii.
Leases
The Company records leases in accordance with ASC 842, 
Leases
, and determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Specifically, a contract is or contains a lease when (1) the contract contains an explicitly or implicitly identified asset and (2) we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that underlying asset and direct how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract in exchange for consideration. If an arrangement contains a lease, the Company performs a lease classification test to determine if the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.
Lease liabilities are recognized on the commencement date of the lease based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to calculate the present value of lease payments is the rate implicit in the lease. Lease liabilities due within the subsequent 12 months of the reporting date are classified as current lease liabilities and are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet. Lease liabilities payable after the subsequent 12 months of the reporting date are classified as non-current lease liabilities and are presented as non-current lease liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.
ROU assets are valued at the initial measurement of the lease liability, plus any indirect costs or rent prepayments, and reduced by any lease incentives and any deferred lease payments. ROU assets are recorded as Right-of-use assets, net of any amortization on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Operating ROU assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, whereas Finance ROU assets are amortized on a front-loaded basis. Depending on the nature of the ROU asset, the amortization expense is either included in exploration and evaluation expenses or in general and administrative expenses. 
The Company subsequently measures the ROU assets for an operating lease at the amount of the remeasured lease liability (i.e. the present value of the remaining lease payments), adjusted for the remaining balance of any lease incentives received, any cumulative prepaid or accrued rent if the lease payments are uneven throughout the lease term and any unamortized initial direct costs. The ROU assets for a finance lease are subsequently measured by amortizing them on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or useful life and also adjustment for any impairments.

xiv.
Investments
The Company consolidates investments over which it has control in accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation (“ASC 810”). Where the Company does not have control over the investment, but has significant influence, the Company records the investment in accordance with ASC 323, 
Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures
, whereby, after recording the initial investment, the Company recognizes its proportional share of results of operations of the affiliate in its consolidated financial statements. The value of the equity method investments is impaired if it is determined that there is an other-than-temporary decline in value.
xv. Short term debt
The Company records borrowings under its short-term debt and line of credit at the amount drawn, net of any directly attributable financing costs. Interest expense is recognized as incurred based on the interest rate specified in the debt and line of credit agreements (Notes 8 and 20). Short-term debt and outstanding balances under the line of credit, are stated under Short-term debt and classified as a current liability. The accrued interest payable amount on the short-term debt and line of credit is disclosed under Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and classified as current liability.
4.
Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgements
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Significant management judgments and estimates were applied to the following areas:
i.
Evaluation of Going Concern
The Company evaluates its ability to operate as a going concern at each reporting period. This evaluation requires the Company to estimate its cash flow commitments over a forecast period of twelve months and whether it has the financial ability to pay for such commitments. Changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on this assessment.
ii.
Valuation of Share-Based Payments
The fair market value of share-based awards granted to employees, non-employees and directors is based on the closing market price of the Company’s shares, on the date these were granted (Note 17).
This valuation approach involves the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are subjective, such as those regarding the probability of future events. Changes in these estimates and assumptions impact the Company’s valuation as of the valuation date and may have a material impact on the valuation of the Company’s common shares. Changes in these assumptions used to determine the fair value of incentive stock options, including the vesting timeline of granted stock options, could have a material impact on the Company’s loss and comprehensive loss.
iii.
Valuation of Warrants
The Company re-measures the fair value of the Private Warrants at the end of each reporting period (Note 15). The fair value of the Private Warrants was estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model whereby the expected volatility was estimated using a binomial model that assigned equal weight to the implied volatility of the Company’s Public Warrants, adjusted for the call feature triggered at prices above $
18.00
 over 
20
 trading days within any 
30
-day period, and the historical volatility of the common share price.

(in thousands of US Dollars, except share, per share amounts and unless otherwise stated)
​
During the year the Company issued Class A warrants and Class B warrants (Note 15). The warrants were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation by running 
250,000
 trials. The model assumed that the Company’s share price follows geometric Brownian motion which is a standard assumption used in Monte Carlo univariate pricing models. The valuation was calculated under a risk-neutral framework using a zero-coupon risk-free interest rate derived from the Treasury Constant Maturities yield curve for a term until the expiry of the Warrants. The Company’s share price was simulated up to the expiration date using a blended volatility, calculated by assigning equal weights to both implied volatility of the Company’s Public Warrants and the historical volatility of the Company’s share price.
iv.
Valuation of Royalty Liability
The Company re-measures the fair value of its royalty liability at each reporting date (Note 9). As NORI is in an advanced exploration stage and pre-production, the fair value of the royalty liability is measured by using a market approach which entails examining recent royalty transactions prior to the reporting date, focusing on those transactions that involve similar metals as contained in NORI’s polymetallic nodules. The Company compares the specific characteristics of these transactions to estimate the fair value of its royalty liability at the reporting date.
​
5.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Issued and Adopted
​
In November 2023, Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2023-07 was issued which improves disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments and addresses requests from investors and other allocators of capital for additional, more detailed information about a reportable segment’s expenses and assets. The ASU applies to all public entities that are required to report segment information in accordance with ASC 280. The adoption of this update did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or disclosures.

Strategic Alliance with Allseas and Affiliates
Development of Project Zero Offshore Nodule Collection System
On March 16, 2022, NORI and Allseas entered into a non-binding term sheet for the development and operation of a commercial nodule collection system. During the year ended December 31, 2024, Allseas provided the Company with engineering, project management and vessel use services consisting of lay-up and transit costs totaling $
11.9
 million, as part of the development of the commercial nodule collection system: these costs were recorded as mining, technological and process development within exploration and evaluation expenses (Note 10) (2023: $
12.1
 million).
Exclusive Vessel Use Agreement with Allseas
On August 1, 2023, the Company entered into an Exclusive Vessel Use Agreement with Allseas pursuant to which Allseas will give exclusive use of the vessel (“
Hidden Gem”)
 to the Company in support of the development of the Project Zero Offshore Nodule Collection System until the system is completed or December 31, 2026, whichever is earlier. In consideration of the exclusivity term, the Company, on August 14, 2023, issued 
4.15
 million common shares to Allseas. Allseas can terminate the agreement if the Company ceases normal operations, assigns assets to creditors, initiates bankruptcy proceedings, or faces unresolved bankruptcy-related actions.
The Company recorded a 
lease liability
 and right-of-use asset of $
6.5
 million, which represents the fair value of 
4.15
 million common shares issued to Allseas on August 14, 2023, as consideration, and equal to the present value of the lease payments. As the entire lease liability was settled within 14 days of the commencement of the lease, the discount rate for calculating the present value of lease payments was determined to be insignificant.

2023 Credit Facility and Loan Agreements with Company Related to Allseas
On March 22, 2023, the Company entered into an Unsecured Credit Facility Agreement, which was amended on July 31, 2023 (“2023 Credit Facility”), with Argentum Cedit Virtuti GCV (the “Lender”), the parent of Allseas Investments S.A. (“Allseas Investments”) and an affiliate of Allseas, pursuant to which, the Company may borrow from the Lender up to $
25
 million in the aggregate, from time to time, subject to certain conditions. All amounts drawn under the 2023 Credit Facility will bear interest based on the 6-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate, 
180
-day average plus a margin of 
4.0
% per annum payable in cash semi-annually (or plus a margin of 
5
% if paid-in-kind at maturity, at the Company’s election) on the first business day of each of June and January. The Company will pay an underutilization fee equal to 
4.0
% per annum payable 
semi-annually
 for any amounts that remain undrawn under the 2023 Credit Facility. The Company has the right to pre-pay the entire amount outstanding under the 2023 Credit Facility at any time before the 2023 Credit Facility’s maturity. The Company has the ability to settle certain charges under the 2023 Credit Facility in cash or in equity at the discretion of the Company. The 2023 Credit Facility also contains customary events of default. On March 22, 2024, the Company entered into the Second Amendment to the Unsecured Credit Facility with the Lender, to extend the 2023 Credit Facility to August 31, 2025 and to provide that the underutilization fee thereunder shall cease to be payable after the date on which the Company or the Lender gives notice of termination of the agreement. Under the amended 2023 Credit Facility, the Company may borrow from the Lender up to $
25
 million in the aggregate through August 31, 2025. On August 16, 2024, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the 2023 Credit Facility, to increase the borrowing limit of the 2023 Credit Facility to $
27.5
 million. On November 14, 2024, as a result of the 2024 Registered Direct Offering (Note 13) the borrowing limit of the 2023 Credit Facility was returned to $
25
 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company has not drawn any amount from the 2023 Credit Facility and has incurred $
1
 million as underutilization fees (December 31, 2023: $
0.8
 million).
On May 27, 2024, the Company entered into a short-term loan agreement with the Lender. In accordance with the agreement, the Lender provided a short-term loan to the Company amounting to $
2
 million (the “Short-Term Loan”) on May 30, 2024. The Short-Term Loan matured on September 10, 2024 (maturity date) and accrued interest at a rate of 
8
% per annum. On the maturity date, Company repaid the entire Loan of $
2
 million and the accrued interest amounting to $
46
 thousand., which was recorded as interest expense.
On September 9, 2024, the Company entered into a working capital loan agreement (the “Working Capital Loan Agreement”) with Allseas Investments, a company related to Allseas. In accordance with the Working Capital Loan Agreement, Allseas Investments provided a loan to the Company of $
5
 million (the “Working Capital Loan”) on September 10, 2024, to be used towards general corporate purposes and for the repayment of all outstanding amounts under the Short-Term Loan between the Company and the 
133

(in thousands of US Dollars, except share, per share amounts and unless otherwise stated)
​
Lender. The Working Capital Loan is payable to Allseas Investments on or before the earlier of (i) the occurrence of certain financing events and (ii) April 1, 2025 (the “Repayment Date”). The Working Capital Loan will bear interest based on the 6-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate, 
180
-day average plus a margin of 
4.0
% per annum and is payable in 
two
 installments on January 2, 2025, and the Repayment Date (or plus a margin of 
5.0
% if all interest payments are deferred to the Repayment Date, at the Company’s election). On October 18, 2024, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Working Capital Loan Agreement with Allseas Investments, resulting in a further draw of $
2.5
 million by the Company and a total Working Capital Loan drawn amount of $
7.5
 million. On March 24, 2025, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement with Allseas Investments and Argentum Cedit Virtuti GCV, pursuant to which the Repayment Date under the Working Capital Loan Agreement was extended to September 30, 2025, with principal and interest now repayable on that date. Additionally, under the same Letter Agreement, the Company and Argentum Cedit Virtuti GCV agreed to cancel the unsecured credit facility established under the 2023 Facility Agreement with no outstanding amounts remaining, other than the Company’s obligation to pay Argentum the Underutilization Fee. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company incurred $
0.2
 million as interest expense.
As at December 31, 2024, the total amount payable to Allseas and its affiliates was 
$
33.3
 million, with 
$
7.5
 million of this amount recorded as short-term debt and the remaining balance recorded in accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet (Note 12) (December 31, 2023: $
13.8
 million, recorded as accrued liabilities). As at December 31, 2024, Allseas and its affiliates owned 
53.8
 million TMC common shares (2023: 
53.8
 million TMC common shares) which constituted 
15.8
% (December 31, 2023: 
17.6

) of total common shares outstanding.
​

Investment in Low Carbon Royalties
On February 21, 2023 (the “Closing Date”), the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, NORI, entered into an investment agreement (the “Royalty Agreement”) with Low Carbon Royalties Inc. (“Low Carbon Royalties”). In connection with the Royalty Agreement, NORI contributed a 
2
% gross overriding royalty (the “NORI Royalty”) on the Company’s NORI project area in the CCZ to Low Carbon Royalties. In consideration of the NORI Royalty, TMC received 
35.0
% of the common shares issued by Low Carbon Royalties and $
5
 million in cash, as of the Closing Date. On March 21, 2023, Low Carbon Royalties acquired additional gross overriding royalties on natural gas fields in Latin America. The royalty acquisitions were financed through the issuance of Low Carbon Royalties common shares to the third-party vendor of such royalties, thereby reducing the Company’s ownership in the Partnership to 
32
% from 
35
%. In connection with the Royalty Agreement the Company entered into an Investor Rights Agreement with Low Carbon Royalties and a shareholder of Low Carbon Royalties, pursuant to which the Company and this shareholder each have a right, subject to certain percentage maintenance, to nominate a director to Low Carbon Royalties’ board of directors, along with registration and information rights. 
As a condition of closing the Royalty Agreement, the parties entered into an agreement with Low Carbon Royalties to mitigate risks associated with the potential termination of the exploitation license granted for one of the royalty-producing natural gas fields in Latin America (the “Exploitation License”). As per the agreement, 5 million contingent value rights (“CVR”) were issued to NORI. The CVR would convert into 
5
 million additional shares of Low Carbon Royalties all of which would be issued to NORI, in the event the Exploitation License is found, in a final decision, to be invalid by the Colombian National Agency of Hydrocarbons prior to the earlier of (1) five years from the issuance of the CVR and (2) the date Low Carbon Royalties becomes a publicly listed entity.
Based on the fair value of the NORI Royalty granted and the cash received, the Company recorded $
9
 million as investment in Low Carbon Royalties on the Closing Date. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s share of the net loss generated by the Low Carbon Royalties was $ 
0.2
 million (2023: 
0.6
 million).

The NORI Royalty was recorded as a royalty liability in the consolidated Balance Sheet in accordance with ASC 470, 
Debt
 (“ASC 470”). The Company elected to account for the royalty liability at fair value through profit and loss. The fair value was determined using a market approach which entails examining recent royalty transactions prior to the reporting date, focusing on those transactions that involve similar metals as contained in NORI’s polymetallic nodules. The Company compares the specific characteristics of these transactions to estimate the fair value. The fair value of the royalty liability as at December 31, 2024 remained unchanged at $
14
 million.

Exploration Contracts
Significant Exploration Agreements
NORI Exploration Contract:
The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, NORI, was granted the NORI Exploration Contract on July 22, 2011 under the sponsorship of Nauru. The contract application fee of $
0.3
 million, provides NORI with exclusive rights to explore for polymetallic nodules in the NORI Area for an initial term of 
15 years
 (renewable for successive 
five-year
 periods) subject to complying with the exploration contract terms (Note 21) and provides NORI with the priority right to apply for an exploitation contract to collect polymetallic nodules in the same area.
NORI has a right to renounce, without penalty, in whole or part of its rights in the NORI Area at any time and therefore does not have a fixed commitment with relation to the NORI Exploration Contract (Note 21).

 periods) subject to complying with the exploration contract terms and a priority right to apply for an exploitation contract to collect polymetallic nodules in the same area.
On March 31, 2020, the Company entered into an acquisition agreement with Deep Sea Mining Finance Ltd. to acquire TOML and other related entities in the group (the “TOML Acquisition”). Total purchase price of the TOML Acquisition, before transaction costs, was $
32.0
 million comprising of $
42.7
 million for exploration contracts offset by $
10.7
 million for deferred tax liability. TOML holds an ISA exploration contract in the CCZ (“TOML Exploration Contract”) and some exploration related equipment.

​
15.
Warrants
Public Warrants
As at December 31, 2024, 
15,000,000
 Public Warrants were outstanding. Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share at a price of $
11.50
 per share beginning on October 9, 2021, subject to restrictions as described further. Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional Public Warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole Public Warrants will trade. The Public Warrants will expire on September 9, 2026 or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. Public Warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of common shares nor any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive common shares.
The Company will not be obligated to deliver any common shares pursuant to the exercise of a Public Warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”) with respect to the common shares underlying the Public Warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration, or a valid exemption from registration is available. No Public Warrants will be exercisable and the Company will not be obligated to issue a common share upon exercise of a Public Warrant unless the common share issuable upon such warrant exercise has been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the registered holder of the warrants. In the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a Public Warrant, the holder of such warrant will not be entitled 
138

Table of Contents
TMC the metals company Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands of US Dollars, except share, per share amounts and unless otherwise stated)
​
to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle any Public Warrants. In the event that a registration statement is not effective for the exercised Public Warrants, the purchaser of a unit containing such warrant will have paid the full purchase price for the unit solely for the common share underlying such unit. 
The Company may call the Public Warrants for redemption:
●
in whole and not in part;
●
at a price of 
$
0.01
 per warrant;
●
upon a minimum of 
30 days
’ prior written notice of redemption; and
●
if, and only if, the closing price of the common shares equals or exceeds 
$
18.00
 per share (as adjusted for share subdivisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 
20
 trading days within a 
30
-
day trading period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.
If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption in certain circumstances, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, by surrendering the Public Warrants for a number of common shares per warrant equal to the lesser of:
●
the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of common shares underlying such warrant, multiplied by the excess of the average reported closing price of common shares for the 
ten
 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders (“Fair Market Value”) over the warrant price by (y) the Fair Market Value, and
●
0.365
.
As at December 31, 2024, the value of outstanding Public Warrants of 
$
19.5
 million was recorded in additional paid in capital.
Private Warrants
As at December 31, 2024, 
9,500,000
 Private Warrants were outstanding. The Private Warrants (including the common shares issuable upon exercise of the Private Warrants) were not transferable, assignable or salable until October 9, 2021, except to permitted transferees. The Private Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that so long as they are held by the Sponsor or any of its permitted transferees:
(i)
the Private Warrants are exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and
(ii)
the Private Warrants are not redeemable by the Company.
The Private Warrants are subject to the Company’s redemption option at the price of $
0.01
 per warrant, if not held by the Sponsor or any of its permitted transferees, provided that the other conditions of such redemption are met, as described above. If holders of the Private Warrants elect to exercise the warrants on a cashless basis, the holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering their Private Warrants for a number of common shares equal to:
●
the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of common shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the average reported closing price of the common shares for the 
ten
 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of warrant exercise is sent to the warrant agent (“fair market value”) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value.

(in thousands of US Dollars, except share, per share amounts and unless otherwise stated)
​
If the Private Warrants are held by a holder other than the Sponsor or any of its permitted transferees, the Private Warrants are redeemable by the Company in all redemption scenarios applicable to the Public Warrants and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.
The Company evaluated the Private Warrants under ASC 815-40, in conjunction with the SEC Statement
,
 and concluded that they do not meet the criteria to be classified in shareholders’ equity. Specifically, the terms of the warrants provide for potential changes to the settlement amounts dependent upon the characteristics of the warrant holder, and, because the holder of a warrant is not an input into the pricing of a fixed-for-fixed option on equity shares, such provision would preclude the warrant from being classified in equity and thus the warrants should be classified as a liability.
The Private Warrants were valued using a Black-Scholes model, which resulted in a Level 3 fair value measurement. The primary unobservable input utilized in determining the fair value of the Private Warrants was the expected volatility of the Company’s common shares. The expected volatility was estimated using a binomial model that assigned equal weight to the implied volatility of the Company’s Public Warrants, adjusted for the call feature triggered at prices above $
18.00
 over 
20
 trading days within any 
30
- day period, and the historical volatility of the common share price.
As at December 31, 2024, the fair value of outstanding Private Warrants of approximately $
0.9
 million is recorded as warrants liability. The following table presents the changes in the fair value of warrants liability:

Class A Warrants
Under the 2023 Registered Direct Offering (Note 13) which closed on August 14, 2023, the Company issued 
3,980,770
 Class A Warrants to purchase common shares at an exercise price of $
3.00
 per share. These Class A Warrants were valued on August 14, 2023, at a fair value of $
0.80
 per warrant, using a Monte Carlo valuation.
The Class A Warrants contain a call provision under which if the Volume Weighted Average Price “VWAP” for 
30
 consecutive trading days exceeds $
6.50
, and the warrant holder does not possess material non-public information provided by the Company, the Company may call for cancellation of the unexercised warrants, offering $
0.0001
 per Warrant Share. If conditions for the call are met, the unexercised portion of these warrants will be cancelled 
ten
 trading days after the call notice is received.
The Class A Warrants were not determined to be liabilities under ASC 480 as they were not required to be redeemed. The Company classified the Class A Warrants as equity (per ASC 815), as the warrants entailed physical settlement and were also considered to be indexed to the Company’s share, wherein, upon exercise, a fixed number of common shares would be issued on payment of a 
140

​
fixed exercise price. As at December 31, 2023, the Company recorded the total fair value of these Class A Warrants amounting to $
3.2
 million as additional paid in capital. 
On January 30, 2024, the Company received the final balance of the committed funding under the 2023 Registered Direct Offering (Note 13) and on January 31, 2024, issued 
2,250,000
 Class A Warrants to purchase common shares at an exercise price of $
3.00
 per share. The Class A Warrants issued on January 31, 2024 had the same terms as the Class A Warrants issued in 2023. 
The remaining 
2,250,000
 Class A Warrants were valued on January 31, 2024, using a Monte Carlo simulation, resulting in a fair value of $
0.69
 per warrant, with the total fair value of these warrants amounting to $
1.6
 million which was recorded as additional paid in capital.
The fair value of the Class A Warrants issued on January 31, 2024 was estimated using the following assumptions:

The 2023 Purchase Agreement stipulates a down round feature wherein if between August 14, 2023, and December 31, 2024, the Company, or its subsidiaries issue, sell, or grant options or rights to purchase common shares or equivalents at a price lower than either i) $
2.00
 or ii) the exercise price in effect, the exercise price of the outstanding Class A Warrants will automatically reset to the lower of these two amounts. On reset of the exercise price, the number of shares issuable will not change. On November 14, 2024, the Company entered into the 2024 Purchase Agreement (Note 13), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell and issue one common share and the accompanying Class B Warrant to purchase one half of a common share at a price of $
1.00
. As the issuance under the 2024 Purchase Agreement was less than $
2.00
 per common share, the down round feature of the Class A Warrants was triggered on November 14, 2024 (the “Trigger date”) and the exercise price was reset from $
3.00
 per share to $
2.00
 per share. In accordance with ASC 260, 
Earnings per Share
, on the Trigger date, the Company measured the difference between the fair values of the Class A Warrants using an exercise price of $
3.00
 per share and an exercise price of $2.00 per share. 
The fair values of the Class A Warrants on November 14, 2024, with an exercise price of $
2.00
 per share and an exercise price of $
3.00
 per share were $
0.50
 per warrant and $
0.41
 per warrant, respectively, and were estimated using Monte Carlo simulations based on the following assumptions:

As the Class B Warrants had the same features as the above-mentioned Class A Warrants, the Company classified the Class B Warrants as equity (per ASC 815) and on November 14, 2024, recorded the fair value of the Class B Warrants amounting to $

The Company’s 2021 Incentive Equity Plan (the “ Incentive Plan”) provides that the aggregate number of common shares reserved for future issuance under the Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2024, there were a total of 
56,634,518
 common shares reserved for issuance under the Incentive Plan out of which 
37,870,371
 common shares remained available for future issuances. These amounts include 
12,262,348
 shares added to the Incentive Plan in January 2024 pursuant to the Incentive Plan’s automatic annual increase provision, provided that 
2,243,853
 of the outstanding common shares shall only be available for awards made to non-employee directors of the Company. On the first day of each fiscal year from 2022 to 2031, the number of common shares that may be issued pursuant to the Incentive Plan is automatically increased by an amount equal to the lesser of 
4
% of the number of outstanding common shares or an amount determined by the board of directors.
Share-based awards consisting of Restricted Share Units (“RSU”) and options under the Short-Term Incentives Plan (“STIP”) and Long-Term Incentives Plan (“LTIP”) have been issued under the 2021 Incentive Equity Plan.
Prior to the 2021 Incentive Plan, the Company had granted share-based awards under the 2018 Stock Option Plan (“2018 Plan”).

On April 9, 2024, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Mr. Jurvetson, a director of the Company. As per the agreement, Mr. Jurvetson would serve as a special advisor to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer for a term of 
five years
. As the sole compensation for his advisory services, Mr. Jurvetson was granted stock options to purchase 
3,440,000
 of the Company’s common shares, with an exercise price equal to $

As these were the first options granted under the Incentive Plan, the expected term was estimated using the simplified method which is calculated as the average of the time to vest for each tranche from the grant date and the 
7-year
 contractual term.
During the year, the Company recognized $
1.3
 million of share-based compensation expense related to the amortization of stock options, reported under general and administrative expenses in the statement of loss and comprehensive loss.
There were

 during the year and as at December 31, 2024, there were 
3,940,000
 options outstanding under the Company’s 2021 Incentive Plan (2023: 
Nil
). The intrinsic value of the outstanding stock options was $ 
nil
 and was calculated by considering the closing market price of the Company’s common shares as the fair value of the Company’s common share. 
The total unrecognized share-based compensation expense of $
4
 million is expected to be recognized over a period of approximately 
two years

Outstanding LTIPs under the 2018 plan:
On March 4, 2021, the Company granted 
9,783,922
 stock options as LTIP. These stock options have an exercise price of $
0.65
 per option and expire on June 1, 2028. 
The LTIP awards vest as follows:
(1)
Tranche 1 - 
25
% when the Company’s market capitalization equals $
3
 billion;
(2)
Tranche 2 - 
35
% when the Company’s market capitalization equals $
6
 billion;
(3)
Tranche 3 - 
20
% upon the date that the ISA grants an exploitation contract to the Company; and
(4)
Tranche 4 - 
20
% upon the commencement of the first commercial production following the grant of the exploitation contract.
Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 vest based on the Company’s market capitalization of $
3
 billion and $
6
 billion, respectively. Accordingly, these options are determined to be market-based awards for which the Company has calculated fair value and derived a service period through which to expense the related fair value. The options included in Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 had a grant date fair value of $
5.59
 per share and $
5.42
 per share and derived service periods of 
0.33
 years and 
1.41
 years, respectively. The Company expensed these awards ratably over the remaining service period.
Tranche 3 and Tranche 4 of the LTIP stock options vest based on the date the ISA grants an exploitation contract and the commencement of commercial production. These options are determined to be performance-based awards. The Company will recognize compensation costs for the performance-based awards if and when the Company concludes that it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved. As at December 31, 2024, no compensation expense related to the performance-based

4.5
 million. An aggregate 
139,048

9,644,875
 LTIP stock options were outstanding.
As at December 31, 2024, total unrecognized share-based compensation expense for the LTIP stock options was $
23
 million.

0.6
 million of previously recognized share-based compensation expense to record the forfeiture of unvested LTIP stock options in the statement of loss and comprehensive loss (2023: $
nil
), evenly apportioned between exploration and evaluation expenses (Note 10) and general and administration expenses.

On April 16, 2024, the Company entered into a new employment agreement with Gerard Barron, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chairman (the “Employment Agreement”) that replaced and superseded Mr. Barron’s existing employment agreement. Under the Employment Agreement, the Company granted Mr. Barron a one-time signing bonus award of market-based restricted stock units (the “Signing RSUs”) amounting to 
20,000,000
 of the Company’s common shares. The Signing RSUs will vest upon the common shares achieving the following closing prices per common share, based on the trailing 
30
-day average price (the “Closing Price”), on or prior to April 16, 2029 (maturity date), subject to Mr. Barron’s continued service with the Company on the applicable vesting date: 
one
-third of the Signing RSUs vest on achievement of a Closing Price of 
$
7.50
, a further 
one
-third vest on achievement of a Closing Price of 
$
10.00
 and the final 
one
-third vest on achievement of a Closing Price of 
$
12.50
 (each subject to equitable adjustment for any stock splits, combinations, reclassifications, stock dividends and the like). Pursuant to the Employment Agreement, Mr. Barron has agreed not to sell any of the common shares issuable upon vesting of the Signing RSUs until after the fifth anniversary of entering into the Employment Agreement.
The Company determined the fair value of the options using the Monte-Carlo valuation method. The fair value of each tranche and the derived service period are as follows:

10,988,032
 common shares reserved for issuance under the ESPP out of which 
10,648,622
 common shares remained available for future issuance under the ESPP. These amounts include 
3,065,587
 shares added to the ESPP in January 2024 pursuant to the ESPP’s automatic annual increase provision. Under the ESPP, the number of shares reserved for issuance is subject to an annual increase provision which provides that on the first day of each of the Company’s fiscal years starting in 2022, common shares equal to the lesser of (i) 
1
% percent of the common shares outstanding on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (ii) such lesser number of shares as is determined by the board of directors will be added to the ESPP.
Participation in the ESPP is available to all full-time and certain part-time employees, subject to certain conditions. The ESPP comprises offering periods that are 
twenty-four
 (24) months in length, which begin on approximately every June 1 and December 1. Each offering period includes 
four
 purchase periods of six months each, which begin on approximately every June 1 and December 1, or at such other times designated by the board of directors or its compensation committee. At the exercise date, which is the last business day of each purchase period, the accumulated deductions from participating employees are used to purchase common shares of the Company. Shares are purchased at a price equal to 
85
% of the lower of either the share price of the Company’s common shares on the first business day of the particular offering period or the last business day of the purchase period. The ESPP also has an automatic reset feature wherein, if the share price of the common share on any exercise date is less than the share price of the common share on the first business day of the applicable offering period, then such offering period shall automatically terminate immediately after the purchase of the common shares. In such case, a new offering period shall commence on the first business day following the exercise date.
The ESPP includes the following limitations:
●
an employee’s contribution is limited to 
15
%
 of the employee’s annual gross earnings, not exceeding the 
$
25,000
 annual limit set under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) established by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
●
an employee’s purchases in any offering period cannot exceed 
15,000
 common shares, and
●
an employee’s purchases are capped, not to exceed 
5
%
 of the Company’s total outstanding common shares.
During 2024, the Company issued 
47,809
 common shares (2023: 
173,672
 common shares) to its employees as part of its ESPP program. A total of $
37
 thousand was charged to the statement of loss and comprehensive loss as share-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2024, representing the share price purchase discount offered by the Company (2023: $
47
 thousand). From the amount charged in 2024, $
19
 thousand was recorded in exploration and evaluation expenses (2023: $
26
 thousand) and $
18
 thousand was recorded in general and administrative expenses (2023: $
21
 thousand).

Loss per Share
Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the loss by the weighted-average number of common shares of the Company outstanding during the year. Diluted loss per share is computed by giving effect to all common share equivalents of the Company, including outstanding stock options, RSUs, warrants, Special Shares and options to purchase Special Shares, to the extent these are dilutive. Basic and diluted loss per share was the same for each year presented as the inclusion of all common share equivalents would have been anti-dilutive.

NORI is currently implementing its approved 2022 to 2026 five-year plan. The cost of the estimated work plan for 2025 onwards is dependent on the ISA’s approval of the NORI Area D exploitation application. Should the approval of NORI’s exploitation application for NORI Area D be delayed or rejected, NORI intends to revise its estimated future work plan in respect of its NORI Area. Work plans are reviewed annually by the Company, agreed with the ISA and may be subject to change depending on the Company’s progress to date. NORI’s exploration contract expires on July 21, 2026. NORI is required to submit an application for

extension no later than six months before the expiration of the contract. NORI intends to submit an application for a five-year extension in 2025.
TOML Exploration Contract
TOML is currently implementing its approved 2022 to 2026 five-year plan, which included an estimated 
five-year
 expenditure of up to $
44
 million. The five-year estimated expenditure is indicative and subject to change, TOML will review the program regularly and TOML will inform the ISA of any changes through its annual reports.
Offtake Agreements
On May 25, 2012, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, DGE, and Glencore International AG (“Glencore”) entered into a copper offtake agreement and a nickel offtake agreement. DGE has agreed to deliver to Glencore 
50
% of the annual quantity of copper and nickel produced at a DGE-owned processing facility from nodules derived from the NORI Area at London Metal Exchange referenced market pricing with allowances for product quality and delivery location. Both the copper and nickel offtake agreements are for the life of the Company’s rights to the NORI Area. Either party may terminate the agreement upon a material breach or insolvency of the other party. Glencore may also terminate the agreement by giving twelve months’ notice.
Sponsorship Agreements
On July 5, 2017, Nauru, the Nauru Seabed Minerals Authority and NORI entered into a sponsorship agreement formalizing certain obligations of the parties in relation to NORI’s exploration and potential exploitation of the NORI Area. Upon reaching the minimum recovery level within the exploitation contract area, NORI will pay Nauru a seabed mineral recovery payment based on the polymetallic nodules recovered from the exploitation contract area. In addition, NORI will pay an administration fee each year to Nauru for such administration and sponsorship, which is subject to review and increase in the event NORI is granted an ISA exploitation contract. NORI has begun discussions with the Government of Nauru to renegotiate the existing sponsorship agreement and has also committed to ensuring NORI pays corporate income tax within Nauru.
On March 8, 2008, Tonga and TOML entered into a sponsorship agreement formalizing certain obligations of the parties in relation to TOML’s exploration and potential exploitation of the TOML Area (“TOML Sponsorship Agreement”). Upon reaching the minimum recovery level within the exploitation contract area, TOML has agreed to pay Tonga a seabed mineral recovery payment based on the polymetallic nodules recovered from the exploitation contract area. In addition, TOML has agreed to pay reasonable direct costs incurred by Tonga to administer the obligations of Tonga to the ISA. On September 23, 2021, the Company and Tonga updated the TOML Sponsorship Agreement harmonizing the terms of its engagement with TOML with those held by NORI with Nauru. TOML expects to renegotiate the existing sponsorship agreement with Tonga prior to entering into operations in the TOML area and has committed to paying corporate income tax within Tonga.
Contingent Liability
On October 28, 2021, a shareholder filed a putative class action against the Company, one of the Company’s executives and a former director in federal district court for the Eastern District of New York, captioned Caper v. TMC The Metals Company Inc. F/K/A Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corp., Gerard Barron and Scott Leonard. The complaint alleges that all defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and Messrs. Barron and Leonard violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose information about the Company’s operations and prospects during the period from March 4, 2021 and October 5, 2021. On November 15, 2021, a second complaint containing substantially the same allegations was filed, captioned Tran v. TMC the Metals Company, Inc. These cases have been consolidated. On March 6, 2022, a lead plaintiff was selected. An amended complaint was filed on May 12, 2022, reflecting substantially similar allegations, with the Plaintiff seeking to recover compensable damages caused by the alleged wrongdoings. The Company denies any allegations of wrongdoing and filed and served the plaintiff a motion to dismiss on July 12, 2022 and intend to defend against this lawsuit. On July 12, 2023, an oral hearing on the motion to dismiss was held. The parties are

currently awaiting a ruling. There is no assurance, however, that the Company or the other defendants will be successful in the Company’s defense of this lawsuit or that insurance will be available or adequate to fund any settlement or judgment or the litigation costs of this action. If the motion to dismiss is unsuccessful, there is a possibility that the Company may incur a loss in this matter. Such losses or range of possible losses cannot be reliably estimated. A resolution of this lawsuit adverse to the Company or the other defendants, however, could have a material effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations in the period in which the lawsuit is resolved.
On January 23, 2023, investors in the 2021 private placement from the Business Combination filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Commercial Division of New York Supreme Court, New York County, captioned Atalaya Special Purpose Investment Fund II LP et al. v. Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corp. n/k/a TMC The Metals Company Inc., Index No. 650449/2023 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.). The Company filed a motion to dismiss on March 31, 2023, after which the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on June 5, 2023. The amended complaint alleges that the Company breached the representations and warranties in the plaintiffs’ private placement Subscription Agreements and breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. The Plaintiffs are seeking to recover compensable damages caused by the alleged wrongdoings. The Company denies any allegations of wrongdoing and filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on July 28, 2023. On December 7, 2023, the Court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss the claim for breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing and denied the Company’s motion to dismiss the breach of the Subscription Agreement claim. The Company filed a notice of appeal regarding the Court’s denial of our motion to dismiss the breach of the Subscription Agreement claim. The appeal was heard on November 8, 2024. The NY Appellate Division upheld the lower court’s ruling in December 2024, moving the case into the discovery phase. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in our defense of this lawsuit or that insurance will be available or adequate to fund any settlement or judgment or the litigation costs of this action. Such losses or range of possible losses cannot be reliably estimated.
On November 8, 2024, a shareholder filed a putative class action against the Company and certain of its executives in federal district court for the Central District of California, captioned Lin v. TMC The Metals Company Inc., Gerard Barron, and Craig Shesky. The complaint alleges that all defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and Messrs. Barron and Shesky violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose information regarding the classification of the non-financial asset received from our partnership with Low Carbon Royalties Inc. and the derecognition of the capitalized exploration contract related to NORI. The alleged misstatements and omissions pertain to the Company’s initial classification of this non-financial asst as a gain on disposition (being a sale of future revenue) and subsequent reclassification thereof as a royalty liability (and re-capitalization of the exploration contract) and the restatement of our previously issued financial statements as a result thereof for the three months ended March 31, 2023, the six months ended June 30, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2023 in March 2024. The complaint purports to represent a class of shareholders who acquired the Company’s securities between May 12, 2023, and March 25, 2024, and seeks to recover compensable damages caused by the alleged wrongdoings. On February 6, 2025, the Court appointed a lead plaintiff. An amended complaint was filed on March 6, 2025. Pursuant to court-approved scheduling, we are expected to serve a motion to dismiss by April 10, 2025, the lead plaintiff is expected to file an opposition by May 15, 2025, and we are expected to reply by June 5, 2025. The Company intends to defend against the lawsuit. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be successful in its defense, or that insurance will be available or adequate to fund any settlement or judgment or the litigation costs of this action. Due to the early stage of this litigation, such losses or range of possible losses cannot be reliably estimated.

The Company files income tax returns in Canada, the United States, Singapore and Tonga, and is subject to examination in these jurisdictions for all years since the Company’s inception in 2011. As at December 31, 2024, all tax years are subject to examination by the tax authorities and no tax authority audits are currently underway. Fiscal years outside the normal statute of limitation remain open to audit by tax authorities due to tax attributes generated in those early years which have been carried forward and may be audited in subsequent years when utilized. The timing of the resolution, settlement and closure of any income tax audits is highly uncertain, and the Company is unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. It is possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next twelve months. As at December 31, 2024, the 2024 tax year filings for the Company and its subsidiaries (where applicable) remain unfiled and have not been assessed by the relative tax authorities.

Subsequent Events
On March 24, 2025, we entered into a Letter Agreement (the “Letter Agreement”) with Allseas Investments and Argentum Cedit Virtuti GCV, pursuant to which the repayment date under our Working Capital Loan agreement with Allseas Investments dated September 9, 2024 was extended to September 30, 2025.
Additionally, under the Letter Agreement, we and Argentum Cedit Virtuti GCV agreed to cancel the unsecured credit facility established in 2023 with no outstanding amounts remaining, other than our obligation to pay the underutilization fee thereunder.
On March 27, 2025, the Company announced that it initiated a process with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Department of Commerce under the U.S. Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act to consider a U.S.-based regulatory pathway for the commercial production of deep-sea polymetallic nodules in the CCZ.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Item 9A.
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation and considering the previously reported material weakness as described below, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2024.
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
●
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;
●
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
●
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
As of December 31, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting, were not effective, as a result of the material weakness discussed below.
As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the “2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K”), management identified a material weakness in the operating effectiveness of our internal control over the accounting for significant, non-routine transactions that resulted from the inadequate and untimely involvement of stakeholders and technical advisors with an appropriate level of expertise to account for significant, non-routine transactions. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
This material weakness resulted in errors in the financial statements and related disclosures in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, and for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 23 to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about these errors and our revisions to these previously issued financial statements.
157

Table of Contents
In order to remediate this material weakness, during 2024, we developed a policy to assist with the identification of significant, non-routine transactions and to define the processes to follow in addressing the accounting and reporting requirements of these transactions. In addition, we rolled out training on processes and controls related to significant, non-routine transactions and identifying circumstances under which we use technical advisors in connection with evaluating such transactions. During the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2024, we identified a significant, non-routine transaction that occurred and we applied the processes as required under the new policy. Although management believes the new policy, processes and training worked effectively for this significant, non-routine transaction, the new internal control over significant, non-routine transactions needs to be in operation and tested for sufficient instances to be considered effective and, therefore, these changes can only be deemed effective once they have been in place over a longer time period and applied in additional instances.
We will continue to review the effectiveness of our newly implemented controls and make improvements as warranted. This is no assurance, however, that these control modifications will ultimately have the intended effects.
Notwithstanding the material weakness, management has concluded that our audited financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are fairly stated in all material respects in accordance with U.S. GAAP for each of the periods presented therein.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Except as noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation of such internal control that occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and implemented, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues within a company are detected. The inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Item 9B.
OTHER INFORMATION
Extension of Credit Facility with ERAS Capital LLC and Gerard Barron
On March 26, 2025, we entered into the Third Amendment to increase the borrowing limit to $44 million in the aggregate ($22 million from each of the 2024 Lenders) and to extend the maturity of the 2024 Credit Facility to June 30, 2026.  The Third Amendment also provides that the 2024 Lenders may extend the term of the 2024 Credit Facility by up to two additional one-year periods (until June 30, 2028 at the latest) and that the 2024 Lenders may terminate the 2024 Credit Facility upon certain company financings.
