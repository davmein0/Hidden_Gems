Item 3.     Legal Proceedings
From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. As of December 31, 2024, there has not been at least a reasonable possibility that we have incurred a material loss from any ongoing legal proceedings, individually or taken together. However, litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we could incur significant charges related to legal matters which could have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position and cash flows. For more information, please refer to Note 9 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements, which is hereby incorporated by reference.
