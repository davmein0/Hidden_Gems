RISK FACTOR SUMMARY
Our business is subject to significant risks and uncertainties that make an investment in us speculative and risky. Below we summarize what we believe are the principal risk factors but these risks are not the only ones we face, and you should carefully review and consider the full discussion of our risk factors in the section titled “Risk Factors,” together with the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occurs (or if any of those listed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K occur), our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, revenue, and future prospects could be seriously harmed. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business.
•
Our quarterly and annual operating results may vary from period to period, which could result in our failure to meet expectations with respect to operating results and cause the trading price of our stock to decline.
•
If we do not successfully anticipate market needs and opportunities or are unable to enhance our solutions and develop new solutions that meet those needs and opportunities on a timely or cost-effective basis, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business and financial condition may be harmed.
•
If we fail to continue to effectively scale and adapt our platform to meet the performance and other requirements of our customers, our operating results and our business would be harmed.
•
If we are unable to renew existing subscriptions for our IT, security and compliance solutions, sell additional subscriptions for our solutions and attract new customers, our operating results would be harmed. 
•
Our current research and development efforts may not produce successful products or enhancements to our platform that result in significant revenue, cost savings or other benefits in the near future.
•
Our platform, products, website and internal systems may be subject to intentional disruption or other security incidents that could result in liability and adversely impact our reputation and future sales.
•
Our sales cycle can be long and unpredictable, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense. As a result, revenues may vary from period to period, which may cause our operating results to fluctuate and could harm our business.
•
Adverse economic conditions or reduced IT spending may adversely impact our business.
•
Our IT, security and compliance solutions are delivered from 14 shared cloud platforms
, and any disruption of service at these facilities would interrupt or delay our ability to deliver our solutions to our customers which could reduce our revenues and harm our operating results.
•
We face competition in our markets, and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to maintain or improve our competitive position.
•
The sales prices of our solutions are subject to competitive pressures and may decrease, which may reduce our gross profits and adversely impact our financial results. 
•
If our solutions fail to detect vulnerabilities or incorrectly detect vulnerabilities, our brand and reputation could be harmed, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

•
If we are unable to recruit and retain qualified sales personnel, sales of our solutions and the growth of our business would be harmed.
•
We rely on third-party channel partners to generate a substantial amount of our revenues, and if we fail to effectively manage our distribution channels, our revenues could decline and our growth prospects could suffer.
•
A significant portion of our customers, channel partners and employees are located outside of the United States, which subjects us to a number of risks associated with conducting international operations, and if we are unable to successfully manage these risks, our business and operating results could be harmed.
•
Our business and operations have continued to grow since inception, and if we do not appropriately manage any future growth, or are unable to improve our systems and processes, our operating results may be negatively affected.
•
We depend on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key employees, the loss of any of whom could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
•
If we are unable to hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, our business may suffer.
•
A portion of our revenues are generated by sales to government entities, which are subject to a number of challenges and risks.
•
Our success in acquiring and integrating other businesses, products or technologies could impact our financial position.
•
Undetected software errors or flaws in our solutions could harm our reputation, decrease market acceptance of our solutions or result in liability.
•
Our solutions could be used to collect and store personal information of our customers’ employees or customers, and therefore privacy and other data handling concerns could result in additional cost and liability to us or inhibit sales of our solutions.
•
We use AI/machine learning technologies in our solutions that could result in harm to our business and operating results.
•
Our solutions contain third-party open source software components, and our failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to sell our solutions.
•
We use third-party software and data that may be difficult to replace or cause errors or failures of our solutions that could lead to lost customers or harm to our reputation and our operating results.
•
Failure to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and operating results.
•
Assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and harm our business and operating results.
