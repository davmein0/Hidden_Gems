          on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to invest in the shares of our common stock.  The occurrence of any of the events described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.  In the
          case of such an event, the trading price of our common stock may decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.

RISK FACTOR SUMMARY

We are providing the following summary of the risk factors contained in our Form 10-K to enhance the readability and accessibility of our risk factor disclosures.  We encourage our stockholders
          to carefully review the full risk factors contained in this Form 10-K in their entirety for additional information regarding the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our
          anticipated future results.

Risks Related to Business and Operations

•

We may not be able to execute our opportunistic buying strategy;

•

Fluctuations in comparable store sales and results of operations, including fluctuations on a quarterly basis, could cause our business performance to decline
                    substantially, as c
omparable store sales and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may do so again in the future;

•

Consumer confidence and spending may be reduced in light of factors beyond our control and our results of operations and financial results may suffer;

•

Competition may increase in our segment of the retail market, which could put negative pressure on our results of operations and financial condition;

•

Identification of potential store locations and lease negotiations may not keep pace with our growth strategy;

•

We are a “brick and mortar only” retailer.  Our lack of an online shopping option and an omnichannel customer experience may mean that we could face challenges to grow and retain customers.  Our customers, including our Ollie’s Army
                  loyalty program members, may determine to shop at other stores or through web- and mobile-enabled services and therefore may not be as likely to shop at our stores;

•

We may not be able to develop and operate our distribution centers in an efficient or effective manner and that may result in not having sufficient inventory in our stores;

•

The loss or disruption of one or more of our distribution centers or disruption of our supply chain or third-party shipping carriers could also make it difficult for us to timely receive or distribute 
merchandise
 to our stores;

•

External economic pressures over which we have no or limited control, including among other items inflation, a significant decline in economic activity across the economy, occupancy costs, and transportation costs may reduce our
                  profitability;

•

Shrinkage or the loss or theft of inventory and/or inventory management may result in material negative impacts on our results of operations; and

•

We may not be able to hire and retain the right people to run our stores and our distribution centers.  We also may not be able to hire and retain managerial personnel, the appropriate merchant team for our retail segment, and the
                  senior management team and executive officers sufficient to meet our goals.  As a consequence, our results of operations and financial results may suffer.

Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Issues

•

We are subject to governmental laws, regulations, procedures, and requirements that can lead to substantial penalties if we fail to achieve and/or maintain compliance;

•

We are subject to risks associated with laws and regulations generally applicable to retailers and the risks associated with failing to comply with these laws and regulations;

•

From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings from customers, suppliers, other vendors, employees, governments and governmental agencies, or competitors;

•

From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings from stockholders; and

•

Legislative, regulatory, and other actions, as well as executive orders and other policies promulgated by the current administration, could be unpredictable and could have unforeseen consequences that could
                  materially, adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing statement, certain proposals regarding federal corporate tax reform and
                  border-adjusted taxes, and taxes, tariffs, and trade sanctions levied on imported goods, all may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

Risks Related to Technology and Cybersecurity

•

We may fail to maintain the security of information we hold relating to personal information or payment card data of our customers, employees, and suppliers;

•

We may not adequately prepare for, or respond to, existing and future privacy legislation; and

•

We may not be able to timely or adequately maintain or upgrade our technology systems needed for operations.

Risks Related to Accounting and Financial Matters

•

If our estimates or judgments relating to significant accounting policies prove to be incorrect, we could suffer negative financial results; and

•

Changes to the accounting rules or regulations could have material adverse effects on our results of operations.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Corporate Governance

•

There is risk associated with our fluctuating quarterly operating results, and we may fall short of prior periods, our projections, or the expectations of securities analysts or investors;

•

We may not declare dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future; and

•

There are provisions in our organizational documents that could delay or prevent a change of control.

Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Capitalization

•

Our credit facility can limit our ability to find other sources of financing;

•

There are covenants contained in our credit facility that we must meet in order to be able to use it;

•

If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet debt service, it could negatively impact our liquidity; and

BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS

We may not be able to execute our opportunistic buying strategy, adequately manage our supply of inventory, or anticipate customer demand, which could
          have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our business is dependent on our ability to strategically source a sufficient volume and variety of brand name merchandise at opportunistic pricing.  We do not have significant control over the
          supply, design, function, cost, or availability of much of the merchandise that we offer for sale in our stores.  Additionally, because we source a substantial amount of our merchandise from suppliers on a closeout basis, or with significantly
          reduced prices for various reasons, we are not always able to purchase specific merchandise on a recurring basis.  We do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers and, therefore, we have no contractual assurances of pricing or access to
          merchandise, and any supplier could discontinue sales to us at any time or offer us less favorable terms on future transactions.  Our merchant team generally makes individual purchase decisions for merchandise that becomes available, and these
          purchases may be for large quantities that we may not be able to sell on a timely or cost-effective basis.  To the extent that certain of our suppliers are better able to manage their inventory levels and reduce the amount of their excess
          inventory, the amount of discount or closeout merchandise available to us could also be materially reduced, potentially compromising our profit margin goals for procured merchandise.  Due to economic uncertainties, governmental orders, or other
          challenges, one or more of our suppliers could become unable to continue supplying discounted or closeout merchandise on terms or in quantities acceptable or desirable to us.  We also compete with other retailers, wholesalers, and jobbers for
          discounted and closeout merchandise to sell in our stores.  Those businesses may be better able to anticipate customer demand or procure desirable merchandise.  Shortages or disruptions in the availability of brand name or unbranded merchandise
          of a quality acceptable to our customers and to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and also may result in customer dissatisfaction.  In addition, we may significantly overstock
          merchandise that proves to be undesirable and be forced to take significant markdowns.  We cannot ensure that our merchant team will continue to identify the appropriate customer demand and take advantage of appropriate buying opportunities,
          which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Risks associated with or faced by our suppliers could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance.

We source our merchandise from a variety of suppliers, and we depend on them to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner.  If one or more of our current suppliers became unable to
          supply merchandise, seeking alternative sources could increase our merchandise costs and supply chain lead time, potentially resulting in temporary reductions in store inventory levels, and could reduce the selection and quality of our
          merchandise.  An inability to obtain alternative sources could materially decrease our sales.  Additionally, if a supplier fails to deliver on its commitments, we could experience merchandise out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales and
          reputational harm.  Further, failure of suppliers to meet our compliance protocols could prolong our procurement lead time, resulting in lost sales and adverse margin impact.  Changes to the prices and flow of certain merchandise is, at times,
          beyond our control for reasons that include, among others: political or civil unrest, acts of war, currency fluctuations, disruptions in maritime lanes, port labor disputes, economic conditions and instability in countries in which foreign
          suppliers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, failure to meet our terms and conditions or our standards, issues with our suppliers’ labor practices or labor disruptions they may experience (such as strikes, stoppages or
          slowdowns, which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption), the availability and cost of raw materials, pandemic outbreaks, merchandise quality or safety issues, transport availability and cost, increases in wage rates
          and taxes, transport security, inflation, and other factors relating to suppliers.  Any such circumstances could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.

Fluctuations in comparable store sales and results of operations, including fluctuations on a quarterly basis, could cause our business performance to
          decline substantially.

Our results of operations have fluctuated in the past, including on a quarterly basis, and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future.

Our comparable store sales and results of operations are affected by a variety of factors, including without limitation:

•

national and regional economic trends in the United States;

•

changes in gasoline prices;

•

changes in shipping and transportation costs;

•

changes in our merchandise mix;

•

the weather;

•

changes in pricing;

•

changes in the timing of promotional and advertising efforts; and

•

holidays or seasonal periods.

If our future comparable store sales fail to meet expectations, then our cash flow and profitability may decline substantially, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and
          results of operations.

We rely on third parties to move merchandise through ports and transport them from ports to our centralized distribution centers.

Our ability to timely and effectively deliver merchandise to our stores relies in part on shipping and transportation partners to timely and safely move our merchandise from manufacturing
          facilities to ports and then onto oceangoing carriers.  The demand for space onboard oceangoing vessels can vary and costs to secure space can vary greatly.  We may be subject to higher transportation costs or be unable to secure space for
          containers on economically reasonable terms.  In addition, there may be labor or other disputes at either ports of departure or at ports of entry that may delay or otherwise hinder the flow of merchandise.  Additional factors, such as customs or
          border control policies and new or changing tariffs or trade sanctions, such as additional or new import tariffs, may further delay or hinder transportation of merchandise or the costs to obtain them.  There are multiple factors in the
          transportation of merchandise that are both outside of our control and which may negatively impact the cost of the merchandise or the timeframes in which we receive the same.

Factors such as inflation, cost increases, and energy prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of
          operations.

Future increases in costs, such as the cost of labor, merchandise, shipping rates, freight and other transportation costs (including import costs), and store occupancy costs, may reduce our
          profitability, given our pricing model.  These cost increases may be the result of inflationary pressures, geopolitical factors, or public policies, which could further reduce our sales or profitability.  Increases in other operating costs,
          including changes in energy prices, wage rates, and lease and utility costs, may increase our cost of merchandise sold or selling, general, and administrative expenses.  Our low-price model and competitive pressures in our industry may inhibit
          our ability to reflect these increased costs in the prices of our merchandise and, therefore, reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Index

Our ability to generate revenue is dependent on consumer confidence and spending, which may be subject to factors beyond our control, including changes in economic and
          political conditions, as well as health concerns.

The success of our business depends, to a significant extent, on the level of consumer confidence and spending.  A number of factors beyond our control affect the level of customer confidence and spending on the
          merchandise that we sell, including, among other items:

•

energy and gasoline prices;

•

shipping and transportation costs;

•

disposable income of our customers, which is impacted by unemployment levels, personal debt levels, and wages;

•

interest rates and inflation;

•

discounts, promotions, and merchandise offered by our competitors;

•

negative reports and publicity about the discount retail industry;

•

outbreak of viruses or widespread illness, and behavioral changes from a fear of contracting such viruses or illness;

•

general economic and industry conditions;

•

food prices;

•

the state of the housing market;

•

customer confidence in future economic conditions;

•

fluctuations in the financial markets;

•

government sponsored relief packages and governmental benefits, such as social security benefits, as affected by current cost of living adjustments, as well as any government stimulus payments and enhanced
                  unemployment benefits;

•

tax rates and policies;

•

repercussions, or perceived repercussions, from the current presidential administration’s policies and activities; and

•

natural disasters, war, terrorism, and other hostilities.

Reduced customer confidence and spending may result in reduced demand for our merchandise, including discretionary items, and may force us to take inventory markdowns.  Reduced demand also may require increased
          selling and promotional expenses.  Adverse economic conditions and any related decrease in customer demand for our merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Many of the factors identified above also affect commodity rates, transportation costs, costs of labor, insurance, and healthcare, the strength of the U.S. dollar, lease costs, measures that create barriers to or
          increase the costs associated with international trade, changes in other laws and regulations, and other economic factors, all of which may impact our cost of 
merchandise
 sold and our selling, general,
          and administrative expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Index

We do not compete in the growing online and omnichannel retail marketplace, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
          condition, and results of operations.

Our long-term business strategy does not presently include the development of online retailing capabilities or offering of an omnichannel shopping experience.  To the extent that we implement
          online operations, we would incur substantial expenses related to such activities and would be exposed to additional risks, including additional cybersecurity risk.  Furthermore, the development of an online retail marketplace is a complex
          undertaking, and there is no guarantee that the resources we apply to this effort will result in any material increased revenues or better overall operating performance.  However, with the growing acceptance of online and omnichannel shopping,
          which may have accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, both among consumers who previously shopped online and consumers who did not previously do so, or did not do so as frequently, we may continue to face challenges related to
          customers shopping in brick-and-mortar stores.  In addition, the increased proliferation of mobile devices and enhanced and robust connections to mobile networks, competition from other retailers in the online and omnichannel retail marketplace
          is expected to continue to increase and may negatively impact our results of operations.  A number of traditional online retailers have established robust online and omnichannel operations.  Increased competition from online or omnichannel
          retailers and our lack of an online or omnichannel retail presence may reduce our customers’ desire to purchase merchandise from us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  If
          consumers determine to shop more online due to cultural or health concerns, those consumers may be less likely to return to brick-and-mortar retailers in the future.

Labor shortages and increased turnover or increases in employee and employee-related costs could have adverse effects on our profitability.

We have experienced in the past, and expect to continue to experience, increased labor shortages at some of our stores and distribution centers. 
            While we have historically experienced some level of ordinary course turnover of employees, the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting actions and impacts have exacerbated labor shortages and increased turnover.  A number of factors have had and may
            continue to have adverse effects on the labor force available to us, including reduced employment pools, federal unemployment subsidies, and other government regulations, which include laws and regulations related to workers’ health and safety,
            wage and hour practices, and immigration.  Labor shortages and increased turnover rates involving our team members have led to, and could in the future lead to, increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates
            to attract and retain employees and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our facilities or otherwise operate at full capacity.  An overall or prolonged labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover, or labor
            inflation 
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations
.

We face intense competition, which could limit our growth opportunities and adversely impact our financial performance.

We compete with a highly fragmented group of competitors, including discount, closeout, mass merchant, department, grocery, drug, convenience, hardware, variety, online, and other specialty stores.  We compete with
          these retailers with respect to product cost and price, store location, supply and quality of merchandise, assortment and presentation, and customer service among other items.  This competitive environment subjects us to the risk of an adverse
          impact to our financial performance because of the lower prices, and thus the lower margins, that are required to maintain our competitive position.  A number of different competitive factors outside of our control could impact our ability to
          compete effectively, including without limitation:

•

entry of new competitors in our markets;

•

vertical integration of competitors;

•

increased operational efficiencies of competitors;

•

online and omnichannel retail capabilities of our competitors;

•

competitive pricing strategies, including deep discount pricing by a broad range of retailers during periods of poor customer confidence, low discretionary income, or economic uncertainty;

•

continued and prolonged promotional activity by our competitors;

•

liquidation sales by our competitors that have filed or may file in the future for bankruptcy;

•

geographic expansion by competitors into markets in which we operate; and

•

adoption by existing competitors of innovative store formats or retail sales methods, including online and omnichannel.

19

Index

A number of our competitors also have greater financial, operational, and other resources, greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, and a broader geographic presence than us.  We may be vulnerable to
          the marketing power and high level of customer recognition of these larger competitors and to the risk that these or other competitors could attract our customer base, including members of Ollie’s Army.

In addition, if any of our competitors were to consolidate their operations, such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market
          penetration, and other improvements in their competitive positions, as well as result in the provision of a wider variety of merchandise at competitive prices by these consolidated companies, which could have a material adverse effect our
          business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to successfully compete against either existing or future competitors.  Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, improved performance by
          our competitors, and changes in the retail markets could result in lost market share and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

If we fail to open new profitable stores on a timely basis, successfully enter new markets, or implement other elements of our long-term growth strategy,
          our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.

Our primary growth strategy is to open new profitable stores and expand our operations into new geographic regions.  We opened 50 new stores in the last fiscal year, for a total of 227 new
          stores over the past five fiscal years, as we continue to backfill in existing markets and expand into additional geographies.  Our ability to timely open new stores depends in part on several factors, many of which are beyond our control,
          including the availability of attractive rents and store locations; the absence of occupancy delays; the ability to negotiate and enter into leases, or acquire ownership of properties, on acceptable terms; our ability to obtain and retain permits
          and licenses; our ability to hire, train, and retain new personnel, especially store managers, in a cost effective manner; our ability to adapt and grow our distribution and other operational and management systems to an increasing and ever
          evolving network of stores; the availability of capital funding for expansion; our ability to respond to the demographic shifts and general economic conditions in the many different geographic markets where our stores and distribution centers are
          located.  See “
