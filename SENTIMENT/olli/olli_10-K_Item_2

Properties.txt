We lease the majority of our retail stores, often in second generation sites ranging in size from 18,000 to 50,000 square feet. Our corporate headquarters, located in Harrisburg, PA, is 58,200
        square feet and is leased under an agreement that expires in February 2033, with options to renew for three successive five-year periods. Our corporate data center and additional office space is 19,800 square feet.  Our 804,000 square foot
        distribution center located in York, PA is leased under an agreement that expires in March 2033 with an option to renew for one five-year period. Our 962,000 square foot distribution center in Commerce, GA is leased under an agreement that expires
        in April 2029 with options to renew for two successive five-year periods. We also own and operate a 615,000 square foot distribution center in Lancaster, TX. In fiscal 2024, we completed construction of our fourth distribution center in Princeton,
        IL. The Princeton, IL facility is 615,000 square feet and began shipping product in July 2024. As of February 1, 2025, there were 559 Ollie’s Bargain Outlet locations across 31 contiguous states in the eastern half of the United States.

We maintain a focused and disciplined approach to entering into lease arrangements. All leases are approved by our real estate committee, which is comprised of senior management and executive
        officers. Our leases generally have an initial term of approximately seven years with options to renew for three to five successive five-year periods and generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes, insurance, and common
        area or other charges.
