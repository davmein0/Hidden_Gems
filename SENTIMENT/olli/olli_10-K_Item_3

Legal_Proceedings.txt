Overview

Ollie’s is 
America’s largest retailer of closeout merchandise and excess inventory. Our stores sell name brand household related items that consumers use in their everyday lives at
          prices that are typically 20% to 70% below traditional retailers.  Known for our assortment of “Good Stuff Cheap®,” we offer customers a broad selection of brand name products, including housewares, bed and bath, food, floor coverings, health and
          beauty aids, books and stationery, toys, and electronics.  Our differentiated go-to market strategy is characterized by a unique, fun, and engaging treasure hunt shopping experience, compelling customer 
value
 proposition and witty, humorous in-store signage and advertising campaigns. These attributes have driven our rapid growth and strong store performance as evidenced by our store base expansion from 388 stores to 559 stores and net sales
          growth from $1.809 billion to $2.272 billion from 2020 to 2024 and average annual net sales per store of $4.3 million for the five-year period.

Our Growth Strategy

Since the founding of Ollie’s in 1982, our principal growth strategy has been the opening of new stores. Historically, we have expanded our store base by opening new stores organically. More recently, we have
        expanded our store base through acquiring former store locations of bankrupt retailers through the bankruptcy auction process. Our growth strategy continuously evaluates the best opportunities in the marketplace and combines organic new store
        openings with the acquisition of store locations. We follow a contiguous unit growth strategy that combines backfilling existing markets and states with entering new markets and states in a contiguous manner. As of February 1, 2025 we have grown to
        559 stores in 31 states.

Our stores are supported by four distribution centers, one each in York, PA, Commerce, GA, Lancaster, TX, and Princeton, IL. 
We 
completed the construction of our Princeton,
        IL distribution center in the second quarter of 2024 and began shipping product in July 2024.

With the addition of our fourth distribution center, we believe our distribution capabilities will support 
up to 750 stores
.

We have invested in our associates, infrastructure, distribution network, and information systems to allow us to continue to rapidly grow our store footprint, including:

•

growing our merchant buying team to increase our access to brand name/closeout merchandise;

•

adding members to our senior management team;

•

expanding the capacity of our distribution centers to their current 3.0 million square feet; and

•

investing in information technology, accounting, and warehouse management systems.

40

Index

Our business model has produced consistent and predictable store growth over the past several years, during both strong and weaker economic cycles.  We plan to continue to enhance our competitive positioning and
        drive growth in sales and profitability by executing on the following strategies:

•

growing our store base;

•

increasing our offerings of great bargains; and

•

leveraging and expanding Ollie’s Army.

We have a proven portable, flexible, and highly profitable store model that has produced consistent financial results and returns.  Our new store model targets a store size between 25,000 to 35,000 square feet and an
        average initial cash investment of approximately $1.0 million, which includes store fixtures and equipment, store-level and distribution center inventory (net of payables) and pre-opening expenses. We target new store sales of approximately $4.0
        million in their first full year of operations
.

While we are focused on driving comparable store sales and managing our expenses, our revenue and profitability growth will primarily come from opening new stores.  The core elements of our business model are
        procuring great deals, offering extreme values to our customers and creating consistent, predictable store growth, and margins.  In addition, our new stores generally open strong, contributing to the growth in net sales and profitability of our
        business. From 2020 to 2024, net sales grew at a CAGR of 5.9%. We plan to achieve continued net sales growth, including comparable stores sales, by adding stores to our store base and by continuing to provide quality merchandise at a value for our
        customers as we scale and gain more access to purchase directly from major manufacturers. We also plan to leverage and expand our Ollie’s Army database marketing strategies.  In addition, we plan to continue to manage our selling, general, and
        administrative expenses (“SG&A”) by continuing to make process improvements and by maintaining our standard policy of reviewing our operating costs.

Our ability to grow and our results of operations may be impacted by additional factors and uncertainties, such as consumer spending habits, which are subject to macroeconomic conditions and changes in discretionary
        income.  Our customers’ discretionary income is primarily impacted by gas prices, wages, rising interest rates, inflation, and consumer trends and preferences, which fluctuate depending on the environment. The potential consolidation of our
        competitors or other changes in our competitive landscape could also impact our results of operations or our ability to grow, even though we compete with a broad range of retailers.

Our key competitive advantage is our direct buying relationships with many major manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, brokers, and retailers for our brand name closeout products and unbranded goods.  We also
        augment our product mix with private label brands.  As we continue to grow, we believe our increased scale will provide us with even greater access to brand name closeout products as major manufacturers seek a single buyer to acquire an entire
        deal.

How We Assess the Performance of Our Business and Key Line Items

We consider a variety of financial and operating measures in assessing the performance of our business.  The key measures we use are number of new stores, net sales, comparable store sales, gross profit and gross
        margin, SG&A, pre-opening expenses, operating income, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA.

Number of New Stores

The number of new stores reflects the number of stores opened during a particular reporting period.  Before we open new stores, we incur pre-opening expenses described below under “Pre-Opening Expenses” and we make
        an initial investment in inventory.  We also make initial capital investments in fixtures and equipment, which we amortize over time.

41

Index

We opened 50 new stores in 2024.  We expect new store growth to be the primary driver of our sales growth. Our initial lease terms are approximately seven years with options to renew for three to
        five successive five-year periods. Our portable and predictable real estate model focuses on backfilling existing markets and entering new markets in contiguous states. Our new stores often open with higher sales levels as a result of greater
        advertising and promotional spend in connection with grand opening events, but decline shortly thereafter to our new store model levels.

Net Sales

We recognize retail sales in our stores when merchandise is sold and the customer takes possession of the merchandise.  Also included in net sales is revenue allocated to certain redeemed discounts earned via the
        Ollie’s Army loyalty program, gift card breakage, and income from our co-branded credit card program.  Net sales are presented net of returns and sales tax. Net sales consist of sales from comparable stores and non-comparable stores, described
        below under “Comparable Store Sales.”  Growth of our net sales is primarily driven by the expansion of our store base in existing and new markets.  As we continue to grow, we believe we will have greater access to brand name closeout merchandise
        and an increased deal selection, resulting in more potential offerings for our customers.  Net sales are impacted by product mix, merchandise mix and availability, as well as promotional activities and the spending habits of our customers. Our
        broad selection of offerings across diverse product categories supports growth in net sales by attracting new customers, which results in higher spending levels and frequency of shopping visits from our customers, including Ollie’s Army members.

The spending habits of our customers are subject to macroeconomic conditions and changes in discretionary income.  Our customers’ discretionary income is primarily impacted by gas prices, wages, inflation, and
        consumer trends and preferences, which fluctuate depending on the environment.  However, because we offer a broad selection of merchandise at extreme values, we believe we are generally less impacted than other retailers by economic cycles that
        correspond with declines in general consumer spending habits.  We believe we also benefit from periods of increased consumer spending.

Comparable Store Sales

Comparable store sales measure performance of a store during the current reporting period against the performance of the same store in the corresponding period of the previous year.  Comparable store sales consist of
        net sales from our stores beginning on the first day of the sixteenth full fiscal month following the store’s opening, which is when we believe comparability is achieved.  Comparable store sales are impacted by the same factors that impact net
        sales.

We define comparable stores to be stores that:

•

have been remodeled while remaining open;

•

are closed for five or fewer days in any fiscal month;

•

are closed temporarily and relocated within their respective trade areas; and

•

have expanded, but are not significantly different in size, within their current locations.

Non-comparable store sales consist of new store sales and sales for stores not open for a full 15 months.  Stores which are closed temporarily, but for more than five days in any fiscal month, are included in
        non-comparable store sales beginning in the fiscal month in which the temporary closure begins until the first full month of operation once the store re-opens, at which time they are included in comparable store sales.

42

Index

Opening new stores is the primary component of our growth strategy and as we continue to execute on our growth strategy, we expect a significant portion of our sales growth will be attributable to non-comparable
        store sales.  Accordingly, comparable store sales are only one measure we use to assess the success of our growth strategy.

Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Gross profit is equal to our net sales less our cost of sales.  Cost of sales includes merchandise costs, inventory markdowns, shrinkage and transportation, distribution, and warehousing costs, including depreciation
        and amortization. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of our net sales. Gross margin is a measure used by management to indicate whether we are selling merchandise at an appropriate gross profit.

In addition, our gross margin is impacted by product mix, as some products generally provide higher gross margins, by our merchandise mix and availability, and by our merchandise cost, which can vary.

Our gross profit is variable in nature and generally follows changes in net sales.  We regularly analyze the components of gross profit, as well as gross margin.  Specifically, our product margin and merchandise mix
        is reviewed by our merchant team and senior management, ensuring strict adherence to internal margin goals.  Our disciplined buying approach has produced consistent gross margins and we believe helps to mitigate adverse impacts on gross profit and
        results of operations.

The components of our cost of sales may not be comparable to the components of cost of sales or similar measures of our competitors and other retailers.  As a result, our gross profit and gross margin may not be
        comparable to similar data made available by our competitors and other retailers.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses

SG&A are comprised of payroll and benefits for store, field support, and support center associates.  SG&A also include marketing and advertising expense, occupancy costs for stores and the store support
        center, insurance, corporate infrastructure, and other general expenses. The components of our SG&A remain relatively consistent per store and for each new store opening. SG&A generally increase as we grow our store base and as our net
        sales increase. A significant portion of our expenses is primarily fixed in nature, and we expect to continue to maintain strict discipline while carefully monitoring SG&A as a percentage of net sales.  We expect that our SG&A will continue
        to increase in future periods with future growth.

The components of our SG&A may not be comparable to the components of SG&A or similar measures of our competitors and other retailers.  As a result, our SG&A may not be comparable to similar data made
        available by our competitors and other retailers.

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses

Property and equipment are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses are calculated over the estimated useful lives of the
        related assets, or in the case of leasehold improvements, the lesser of the useful lives or the remaining term of the lease. Expenditures for additions, renewals, and betterments are capitalized; expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged
        to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. Depreciation and amortization as it relates to our distribution centers is included within cost of sales on the
        consolidated statements of income.

43

Index

Pre-Opening Expenses

Pre-opening expenses consist of expenses of opening new stores and distribution centers, as well as store remodel and store closing costs.  For opening new stores, pre-opening expenses include grand opening
        advertising costs, payroll expenses, travel expenses, employee training costs, rent expenses, and store setup costs.  Pre-opening expenses for new stores are expensed as they are incurred, which is typically within 30 to 45 days of opening a new
        store. For opening distribution centers, pre-opening expenses primarily include inventory transportation costs, employee travel expenses, and occupancy costs. Store remodel costs primarily consist of payroll expenses, travel expenses, and store
        setup costs expensed as they are incurred. Store closing costs primarily consist of insurance deductibles, rent, and store payroll.

Operating Income

Operating income is gross profit less SG&A, depreciation and amortization, and pre-opening expenses.  Operating income excludes net interest income or expense, and income tax expense.  We use operating income as
        an indicator of the productivity of our business and our ability to manage expenses.

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are key metrics used by management and our Board to assess our financial performance.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also frequently used by analysts, investors, and other interested
        parties to evaluate companies in our industry.  We use Adjusted EBITDA to supplement 
U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”)
 measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our
        business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to evaluate our performance in connection with compensation decisions and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.  Management believes it is useful to
        investors and analysts to evaluate these non-GAAP measures on the same basis as management uses to evaluate the Company’s operating results.  We believe that excluding items from operating income, net income, and net income per diluted share that
        may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our core operating results, and that may vary in frequency or magnitude, enhances the comparability of our results and provides a better baseline for analyzing trends in our business.

We define EBITDA as net income before net interest income or expense, depreciation and amortization expenses, and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted for non-cash stock-based
        compensation expense and gains on insurance settlements.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools,
        and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In the future we may incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted
        EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these items.  For further discussion of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and for reconciliations of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to
        EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, see “Results of Operations.”

2024 Compared with 2023

Net Sales

Net sales increased to $2.272 billion in 2024 from $2.103 billion in 2023, an increase of $169.0 million, or 8.0%.  The increase in net sales was the result of new store unit growth and a comparable store sales
        increase of 2.8%. Excluding the 53rd week, sales increased 9.8% year over year.

Comparable store sales increased 2.8% in 2024 compared with a 5.7% increase in 2023.  The increase in comparable store sales consisted of an increase in the number of transactions and basket size.

Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Gross profit increased to $914.5 million in 2024 from $832.4 million in 2023, an increase of $82.1 million, or 9.9%.  Gross margin increased 70 basis points to 40.3% in 2024 from 39.6% in 2023.  The increase in gross
        margin in fiscal 2024 is primarily due to favorable supply chain costs.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses

SG&A increased to $612.4 million in 2024 from $562.7 million in 2023, an increase of $49.7 million, or 8.8%.  Included in SG&A expenses in 2024 is a one-time expense of $5.5 million for the accelerated
        expense resulting from the modification of existing equity awards for our Executive Chairman. Excluding this one-time expense, SG&A increased 7.9% to $606.9 million in 2024 from $562.7 million in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by
        higher selling expenses associated with our new store unit growth.  As a percentage of net sales, SG&A, exclusive of the one-time stock awards expense, decreased 10 basis points to 26.7% in 2024 from 26.8% in 2023. This decrease is primarily
        the result of increased leverage of fixed expenses from the increase in comparable store sales.

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $33.2 million in 2024 from $27.8 million in 2023, an increase of $5.4 million, or 19.4%, the result of the i
ncreased asset
        base due to new store growth and investments in existing stores

Pre-opening expenses increased to $19.3 million in 2024 from $14.1 million in 2023, an increase of $5.2 million, or 37.3%. The increase is primarily due to the earlier timing of new store openings in fiscal 2025 as
        compared to fiscal 2024, start-up costs related to opening the Princeton, IL distribution center, and dark rent expense associated with the bankruptcy acquired new store locations. We opened 50 new stores and closed three stores in 2024 compared
        with having opened 45 new stores and closed one store in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, pre-opening expenses increased 20 basis points to 0.9% in 2024 from 0.7% in 2023.

Interest Income, Net

Interest income, net was $16.3 million in 2024 compared with $14.7 million in 2023. The increase in interest income, net in 2024 is primarily due to higher average cash and cash equivalent and short-term investments
        balances compared to 2023.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense increased to $66.1 million in 2024 from $61.0 million in 2023, an increase of $5.0 million, or 8.2%.  The effective tax rates for 2024 and 2023 were 24.9% and 25.2%, respectively.  The variance in
        the effective tax rates between the periods was primarily due to an increase in discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Discrete tax benefits totaled $2.8 million and $1.1 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. For further
        information, see Note 8 under “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Net Income

As a result of the foregoing, net income increased to $199.8 million in 2024 from $181.4 million in 2023, an increase of $18.3 million, or 10.1%.

Adjusted EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA increased to $313.1 million in 2024 from $275.2 million in 2023, an increase of $37.9 million, or 13.8%.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview

Our primary sources of liquidity are net cash flows provided by operating activities and available borrowings under our $100.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. As of February 1, 2025, we had $428.7 million of cash
        and cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand and $85.8 million available to borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility. For further information regarding our Revolving Credit Facility, see Note 7 under “Notes to the Consolidated
        Financial Statements.”

Our primary cash needs are for capital expenditures and working capital.  Additionally, we have made and may continue to make discretionary share repurchases (see “Share Repurchase Program” below for further
        discussion).

Our capital expenditures are primarily related to new store openings, lease acquisitions and related build-out costs, store resets, which consist of improvements to stores as they are needed, expenditures related to
        our distribution centers, and infrastructure-related investments, including investments related to upgrading and maintaining our information technology systems.  We spent $120.6 million and $124.4 million for capital expenditures in 2024 and 2023,
        respectively.  We opened 50 new stores and closed three store in 2024.

Capital expenditures in 2025 are planned to be approximately $83 to $88 million, primarily for the opening of 75 new stores, store-level initiatives at our existing stores, as well as general corporate capital
        expenditures, including information technology.  We have experienced, and may continue to experience, delays in construction and permitting of new stores and other projects.

47

Index

Our primary working capital requirements are for the purchase of merchandise inventories, payroll, store rent associated with our operating leases, other store operating costs, distribution costs, and general and
        administrative costs.  Our working capital requirements fluctuate during the year, rising in our third fiscal quarter as we increase quantities of inventory in anticipation of our peak holiday sales season in our fourth fiscal quarter. 
        Fluctuations in working capital are also driven by the timing of new store openings.

A financial instrument which potentially subjects the Company to a concentration of credit risk is cash. Ollie’s currently maintains its day-to-day operating cash balances with major financial institutions. The
        Company’s operating cash balances are in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limit. From time to time, Ollie’s invests temporary excess cash in overnight investments with expected minimal volatility, such as money
        market funds. Although the Company maintains balances which exceed the FDIC insured limit, it has not experienced any losses related to these balances.

We believe our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments position, net cash provided by operating activities and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to finance our planned
        capital expenditures, working capital requirements, debt service, and other financing activities over the next 12 months.  If cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility are not sufficient or available
        to meet our capital requirements, we will be required to obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future.  There can be no assurance equity or debt financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, the terms will be
        satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then-current stockholders.

Share Repurchase Program

On December 15, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of shares of the Company’s common stock. On March 16, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company
        authorized an increase of $100.0 million in the Company’s share repurchase program, resulting in $200.0 million approved for share repurchases through January 13, 2023.  On November 30, 2021, the Board authorized an additional $200.0 million to
        repurchase stock pursuant to the Company’s share repurchase program, expiring on December 15, 2023.  On November 30, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an extension to the existing share repurchase program set to expire on December
        15, 2023, until March 31, 2026.  On March 19, 2025, the Company announced the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of an additional $300.0 million of the Company’s outstanding common stock, effective through March 31,
        2029.  The shares to be repurchased may be purchased from time to time in open market conditions (including blocks), privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs or other derivative transactions, issuer self-tender
        offers or any combination of the foregoing.  The timing of repurchases and the actual amount purchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of our shares, general market, economic and business conditions, and other
        corporate considerations.  Repurchases may be made pursuant to plans intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which could allow us to purchase our shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from
        doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods.  Repurchases are expected to be funded from cash on hand or through the utilization of our Revolving Credit Facility.  The repurchase authorization does not
        require the purchase of a specific number of shares and is subject to suspension or termination by our Board of Directors at any time.

During 2024, we repurchased 639,788 shares of our common stock for $53.0 million, inclusive of transaction costs, pursuant to our share repurchase program, and during 2023, we repurchased 808,669 shares of our common
        stock for $52.5 million, inclusive of transaction costs.  These expenditures were funded by cash generated from operations.  As of February 1, 2025, we had approximately $32.7 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization.  There can
        be no assurances that any additional repurchases will be completed, or as to the timing or amount of any repurchases.

Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities in 2024 totaled $227.5 million compared with $254.5 million in 2023.  The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2024 was primarily due to changes in
        working capital, most notably the timing of tax and merchandise payments, partially offset by higher net income year over year.

Cash Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities totaled $255.3 million in 2024 compared with $150.1 million in 2023.  The increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to a larger investment in capital
        expenditures related to the development of new stores, the completion of our fourth distribution center in Princeton, IL, the acquisition of former 99 Cents Only Store locations and the acquisition of former Big Lots store leases, and purchases of
        short-term investments of $482.7 million in the current year, partially offset by maturities of short-term investments of $347.5 million.

Cash Used in Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities totaled $33.3 million in 2024 compared with $48.7 million in 2023.  The change in cash outflow in 2024 is primarily due to $24.0 million of proceeds from stock option exercises
        in fiscal 2024 as compared to $6.7 million of proceeds from stock option exercises in fiscal 2023.

Credit Facilities

The Company’s credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) provides for a five-year $100.0 million revolving credit facility, which includes a $45.0 million sub-facility for letters of credit and a
        $25.0 million sub-facility for swingline loans (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).  In addition, the Company may at any time add term loan facilities or additional revolving commitments up to $150.0 million pursuant to terms and conditions set out
        in the Credit Facility. On January 9, 2024, the Company refinanced its credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), pursuant to which the maturity date for any loans under the revolving credit facility was extended for a period of five years and a zero
        percent (0.0%) interest rate floor was added to the option for the SOFR Loan Rate (as defined in the Amendment). Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility mature on January 9, 2029.

The interest rates for the Credit Facility are calculated as follows: for ABR Loans, the highest of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50% and Term SOFR with a term of one-month in effect on such
        day plus the SOFR Spread Adjustment plus 1.0%, plus the Applicable Margin, or, for SOFR Loans, the SOFR Loan Rate plus the Applicable Margin plus the SOFR Spread Adjustment. The Applicable Margin will vary from 0.00% to 0.50% for an ABR Loan and
        1.00% to 1.50% for a SOFR Loan, based on availability under the Credit Facility. The SOFR Loan Rate is subject to a 0% floor.

Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, as of February 1, 2025, we could borrow up to 90.0% of the most recent appraised value (valued at cost, discounted for the current net orderly liquidation value) of
        our eligible inventory, as defined, up to $100.0 million.

49

Index

As of February 1, 2025, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, with $85.8 million of borrowing availability, outstanding letters of credit commitments of $14.0 million and $0.2 million
        of rent reserves.  The Revolving Credit Facility also contains a variable unused line fee ranging from 0.125% to 0.250% per annum. We incurred unused line fees of approximately $0.1 million in each of 2024 and 2023.

The Credit Facility is collateralized by the Company’s assets and equity and contains a financial covenant, as well as certain business covenants, including restrictions on dividend payments, which we must comply
        with during the term of the agreement.  The financial covenant is a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio test of at least 1.0 to 1.0 applicable during a covenant period, based on reference to availability.  We were in compliance with all terms
        of the Credit Facility during 2024.

The provisions of the Credit Facility restrict all of the net assets of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries, which constitutes all of the net assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of February 1, 2025, from
        being used to pay any dividends or make other restricted payments to the Company without prior written consent from the financial institutions that are a party to the Credit Facility, subject to material exceptions including proforma compliance
        with the applicable conditions described in the Credit Facility.

Contractual Obligations

We enter into long-term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily operating leases. The following table summarizes our material cash requirements over the next several periods from known contractual

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that 
have
 or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
          condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

Seasonality

Our business is seasonal in nature and demand is generally the highest in our fourth fiscal quarter due to the holiday sales season.  To prepare for the holiday sales season, we must order and keep in stock more
        merchandise than we carry during other times of the year and generally engage in additional marketing efforts.  We expect inventory levels, along with accounts payable and accrued expenses, to reach their highest levels in our third and fourth
        fiscal quarters in anticipation of increased net sales during the holiday sales season.  As a result of this seasonality, and generally because of variation in consumer spending habits, we experience fluctuations in net sales and working capital
        requirements during the year.  Because we offer a broad selection of merchandise at extreme values, we believe we are generally less impacted than other retailers by economic cycles which correspond with declines in general consumer spending habits
        and we believe we still benefit from periods of increased consumer spending.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  A summary of our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 1 to our audited
          consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets,
          liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures.  These judgments and estimates are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.  
We have identified the policies below as critical to
        our business operations and understanding of our results of operations.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined using the retail inventory method on a first-in, first-out basis. The cost of inventories includes the merchandise cost,
        transportation costs, and certain distribution and storage costs. Such costs are thereafter expensed as cost of sales upon the sale of the merchandise.

Under the retail inventory method, which is widely used in the retail industry, inventory is segregated into departments of merchandise having similar characteristics.  The valuation of
        inventories and the resulting gross profit is derived by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories for each department.

Inherent in the retail inventory method are certain management judgments and estimates including, among others, merchandise markups, the amount and timing of permanent markdowns, and shrinkage,
        which may significantly impact both the ending inventory valuation and gross profit.

Factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include uncertainties related to inventory obsolescence, excess inventories, current and anticipated demand, age of the merchandise
        and customer preferences.  A significant increase in the demand for merchandise could result in a short-term increase in inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory
        quantities on-hand.  If our inventory is determined to be overvalued in the future, we would be required to recognize such costs in cost of sales and reduce operating income at the time of such determination.  Therefore, although every effort is
        made to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of merchandise demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or in economic conditions within our markets could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating
        results.  Similarly, if higher than anticipated levels of shrinkage were to occur, it could have a material effect on our results of operations. We calculate our shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period
        and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period. This accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales for each retail store, at a department level, based on the
        company’s most recent historical shrink rate adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions and business trends. To the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than the estimated accrual, our effective shrink
        rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting to the actual results.

We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize permanent markdowns or inventory shrinkage in the financial periods presented nor do we anticipate material changes in
        assumptions we use for permanent markdowns or shrinkage.  As previously stated, however, if our actual experience does not accurately reflect our assumptions and forecasts, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.  We believe a
        10% change in our assumptions as of February 1, 2025 would have impacted net income by approximately $1.0 million in 2024.

Index

Goodwill/Intangible Assets

We amortize intangible assets over their useful lives unless we determine such lives to be indefinite. Goodwill and intangible assets having indefinite useful lives are not amortized to earnings,
        but instead are subject to annual impairment testing or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill or intangible assets having indefinite useful lives might be impaired.

Goodwill and intangible assets having indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually in the fiscal month of October. We have the option to evaluate qualitative factors to determine if
        it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of our sole reporting unit or our nonamortizing intangible assets (consisting of a tradename) exceed their implied respective fair value and whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative
        analysis to determine impairment. As part of this qualitative assessment, we weigh the relative impact of factors that are specific to our sole reporting unit or our nonamortizing intangible assets as well as industry, regulatory and macroeconomic
        factors that could affect the inputs used to determine the fair value of the assets.

If management determines a quantitative goodwill impairment test is required, or it elects to perform a quantitative test, the test is performed by determining the fair value of our sole
        reporting unit. Fair value is determined based on our public market capitalization. The carrying value of goodwill is considered impaired when the reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value and the Company would record an
        impairment loss equal to the difference, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

If management determines a quantitative analysis of intangible assets having indefinite useful lives is required, the test is performed using the discounted cash flow method based on management’s
        projection of future revenues and an estimated royalty rate to determine the fair value of the asset, specifically, our tradename.  An impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the implied fair value of
        that asset.

Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties as they require management to make assumptions and apply judgment to qualitative factors as well as estimate future cash flows by forecasting
        financial performance.  Our policy is to conduct impairment testing based on our most current business plans, which reflect anticipated changes in the economy and the retail industry. Should significant changes in our overall business strategy,
        future results or economic events cause us to adjust our projected cash flows, future estimates of fair value may not support the carrying amount of these assets. If actual results prove inconsistent with our assumptions and judgments, we could be
        exposed to an impairment charge.

For 2024 and 2023, we completed an impairment test of our goodwill and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed.  Similarly, for 2024 and 2023, we completed an impairment test of our
        tradename and determined that no impairment of the asset existed.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks

Interest Rate Risk

Our operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on our Credit Facility, which carries variable interest rates.  As of February 1, 2025, our Credit Facility consisted
        solely of a Revolving Credit Facility with advances tied to a borrowing base.  Because our Credit Facility bears interest at a variable rate, we are exposed to market risks relating to changes in interest rates. As of February 1, 2025, we had no
        outstanding variable rate debt under our Revolving Credit Facility.  We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes, but this does not preclude our adoption of specific hedging strategies in the future.

Impact of Inflation

Our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the
        estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our historical results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial. We cannot be assured that our results of operations and financial condition will not be
        materially impacted by inflation in the future.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors

Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc.:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, the related consolidated statements of
      income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 1, 2025, and the related notes and financial statement schedule I - condensed financial information of registrant (collectively, the
      consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, and the results of its operations
      and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 1, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2025, based on
      criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 26, 2025 expressed an
      unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public
      accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
      PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
      free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures
      that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
      significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and
      that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any
      way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it
      relates.

Estimation of store shrink

As discussed in Note 1(h) to the consolidated financial statements, inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined using the retail inventory method on a first-in, first-out basis. The retail
      inventory method is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and shrinkage (or shrink). The Company calculates the shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and estimated shrink occurring
      subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period. This accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales for each retail store, at a department level, based on the Company’s most recent historical shrink rate adjusted,
      if necessary, for current economic conditions and business trends.  The Company’s inventories were $552.5 million as of February 1, 2025.

We identified the evaluation of the estimation of store shrink occurring between the physical inventory counts and the fiscal year-end as a critical audit matter.  Evaluation of the Company’s estimation of shrink at
      the end of the fiscal year involved subjective auditor judgment due to the estimation uncertainty associated with the shrink rate assumption.

The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the estimation of
      store shrink. We evaluated the appropriateness of the Company’s shrink accrual at the end of the fiscal year by (1) evaluating the shrink rate used by comparing to historical shrink rates, (2) testing the application of the method and certain
      assumptions used, and (3) performing a sensitivity analysis over the shrink reserve estimate.

Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a)

Description of Business

Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the “Company” or “Ollie’s”) principally buys overproduced,
      overstocked, and closeout merchandise from manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, brokers, and other retailers. In addition, the Company augments its name-brand closeout deals with directly sourced private label products featuring names exclusive
      to Ollie’s in order to provide consistently value-priced goods in select key merchandise categories.

Since its first store opened in 1982, the Company has grown to 
559
 retail locations in 
31
 states 
as of February 1, 2025. Ollie’s Bargain Outlet retail locations are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia,
        Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia,
        Wisconsin, and West 
Virginia.

(b)

Fiscal Year

Ollie’s follows a 52/53-week fiscal year, which ends on the Saturday nearer to January 31st of the following calendar year.  
References to the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025 refer to the 52-week period from February 4, 2024 to February 1, 2025 (“2024”).

References

      to the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 refer to the 53-week period from January 29, 2023 to February 3, 2024 (“2023”).  References to the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023 refer to the 52-week period from January 30, 2022 to January 28, 2023
      (“2022”). 

(c)

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in
      consolidation.

(d)

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to
      make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
      during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

(e)

Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Short-term Investments

The Company considers cash on hand in stores, bank deposits, credit card receivables, and all highly liquid investments such as

money market funds, treasury bonds and municipal bonds with remaining maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash and cash equivalents. Investments with maturities greater than three
        months, but less than 1 year at the date of acquisition are classified as short-term investments. Amounts receivable from debit card and credit card issuers are typically converted to cash within one to two business days of the original sales
        transaction.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(f)

Fair Value Disclosures

Fair value is defined as the price which the Company would receive to sell an asset or
        pay to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In determining fair value, GAAP establishes a three‑level hierarchy used in measuring fair value, as follows: 

●

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices available for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.

●

Level 2 inputs are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other inputs
              that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

●

Level 3 inputs are unobservable, developed using the Company’s estimates and assumptions, which reflect those that market participants would use.

Ollie’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and the Company’s credit facilities. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents,
        accounts receivable, and accounts payable are representative of their respective fair value because of their short-term nature. The carrying amount of the Company’s credit facilities, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
        additional information related to our credit facility, approximates its fair value because the interest rates are adjusted regularly based on current market conditions. Under the fair value hierarchy, the fair market values of cash equivalents and
        the investments in treasury bonds and corporate bonds are Level 1 while the investments in municipal bonds are Level 2. 
Fair market value of Level 2 investments is determined by Management. 
Since quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available, these
        prices are determined by the third-party pricing service using observable market information such as quotes from less active markets and quoted prices of similar securities.

As of  
February 1, 2025 and 
February 3,
          2024,
 the Company’s investment securities are classified as held-to-maturity since the Company has both the intent and ability to hold the investments to maturity. Such securities are carried at amortized cost plus accrued interest and
        consist of the following:

OLLIE’S BARGAIN OUTLET HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(g)

Concentration of Credit Risk

A financial instrument which potentially subjects the Company to a concentration of credit risk is cash. Ollie’s currently
          maintains its day‑to‑day operating cash balances with major financial institutions. The Company’s operating cash balances are in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limit. Ollie’s invests temporary excess cash
          in overnight investments with expected minimal volatility, such as money market funds. Although the Company maintains balances which exceed the FDIC insured limit, it has not experienced any losses related to these balances.

(h)

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined
      using the retail inventory method on a first-in, first-out basis. The cost of inventories includes the merchandise cost, transportation costs, and certain distribution and storage costs. Such costs are thereafter expensed as cost of sales upon the
      sale of the merchandise.

Inherent in the retail inventory method are certain management
      judgments and estimates including, among others, merchandise markups, the amount and timing of permanent markdowns, and shrinkage, which may significantly impact both the ending inventory valuation and gross profit.

Factors
        considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include inventory obsolescence, excess inventories, current and anticipated demand, age of the merchandise, and customer preferences.  Pursuant to the retail inventory method, permanent
        markdowns result in the devaluation of inventory and the resulting gross profit reduction is recognized in the period in which the markdown is recorded.

We calculate our shrink provision based on actual physical
        inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period. This accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales for each retail store,
        at a department level, based on the company’s most recent historical shrink rate adjusted, if necessary, for current economic conditions and business trends.

(i)

Property and Equipment

Property and
        equipment are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are calculated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, or in the case of leasehold improvements, the lesser of the
        useful lives or the remaining term of the lease. Expenditures for additions, renewals, and betterments are capitalized; expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line
        method for financial reporting purposes.

The useful lives for the purpose of computing depreciation and amortization are as
      follows: 

Software

3 years

Automobiles

2
 - 
5 years

Computer equipment

5 years

Furniture, fixtures, and equipment

7
 - 
10 years

Buildings

40 years

OLLIE’S BARGAIN OUTLET HOLDINGS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(j)

Goodwill/Intangible Assets

The Company amortizes intangible assets over their useful lives unless it determines such lives to be indefinite.  Goodwill and intangible assets
      having indefinite useful lives are not amortized to earnings, but instead are subject to annual impairment testing or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill or intangible assets having indefinite useful lives
      might be impaired.

Goodwill and intangible assets having indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually in the fiscal month of October.  The Company has the
      option to evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of its sole reporting unit or its nonamortizing intangible assets (consisting of a tradename) exceed their implied respective fair value and
      whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative analysis to determine impairment.  As part of this qualitative assessment, the Company weighs the relative impact of factors that are specific to its sole reporting unit or its nonamortizing
      intangible assets as well as industry, regulatory and macroeconomic factors that could affect the inputs used to determine the fair value of the assets.

If management determines a quantitative goodwill impairment test is required, or it elects to perform a quantitative test, the test is performed by
      determining the fair value of the Company’s sole reporting unit.  Fair value is determined based on the Company’s public market capitalization. The carrying value of goodwill is considered impaired when the reporting unit’s fair value is less than
      its carrying value and the Company would record an impairment loss equal to the difference, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

For 
2024, 2023, and
        2022, the 
Company completed an impairment test of its goodwill and determined that 
no
 impairment of goodwill existed.

If management determines a quantitative analysis of intangible assets having indefinite useful lives is required, the test is performed using the
      discounted cash flow method based on management’s projections of future revenues and an estimated royalty rate to determine the fair value of the asset, specifically, the Company’s tradename.  An impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the
      carrying amount of the asset over the implied fair value of that asset.

For 
2024, 2023, and 2022
, the 
 Company completed an impairment test of its tradename and determined that 
no
 impairment of the asset existed.

(k)

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
      amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its
      carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset or asset group is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined
      through various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.

(l)

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock-based compensation based on the grant date fair value of the
      employee stock award.  For stock option awards, the Company estimates grant date fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.  For restricted stock unit awards, grant date fair value is determined based on the closing trading value of the
      Company’s stock on the date of grant. In both cases, stock-based compensation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the entire award.

(m)

Cost of Sales

Cost of sales includes merchandise costs, inventory markdowns, shrinkage and transportation, distribution and warehousing costs, including
      depreciation
 and
        amortization
.

(n)

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general, and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) are comprised of payroll and benefits for stores, field support, and support center
      associates.  SG&A also include marketing and advertising expense, occupancy costs for stores and the store support center, insurance, corporate infrastructure, and other general expenses.

(o)

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs primarily consist of print flyers, digital media, email campaigns, and media broadcasts and are generally expensed the first time the advertising occurs. Advertising expense 
for 2024, 2023, and 2022 was
 $
69.8
 million, $
64.5
 million, and $
62.4
 million, respectively
.

(p)

Operating Leases

The Company generally leases its store locations, distribution centers and office facilities. Many of the lease agreements contain rent holidays, rent
      escalation clauses and contingent rent provisions – or some combination of these items.  For leases of store locations and the store support centers, the Company recognizes rent expense in SG&A.  For leases of distribution centers, the Company
      recognizes rent expense within cost of sales.  All rent expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the accounting lease term, which includes lease renewals determined to be reasonably certain.

The Company
        recognizes operating lease assets and liabilities at the lease commencement date in accordance with ASC 842, Leases (Topic 842).  Operating lease liabilities represent the present value of lease payments not yet paid.  Operating lease assets
        represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term.  The Company’s lessors do not provide an implicit rate, nor is one readily available, therefore the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the portfolio
        approach, which applies one rate to leases within a given period. The incremental borrowing rate is used to discount future cash flows and is an estimate which is determined by an analysis of the rate of interest it would have to pay on a
        collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms and current market conditions.

Pre-Opening Expenses

Pre-opening expenses consist of expenses
        of opening new stores and distribution centers, as well as store remodel and store closing costs.  For opening new stores, pre-opening expenses include grand opening advertising costs, payroll expenses, travel expenses, employee training costs,
        rent expenses, and store setup costs.  Pre-opening expenses for new stores are expensed as they are incurred, which is typically 
within 
30
 to 
45 days
 of
 opening a new store. For opening
        distribution centers, pre-opening expenses primarily include inventory transportation costs, employee travel expenses, and occupancy costs. Store remodel costs primarily consist of payroll expenses, travel expenses, and store setup costs expensed
        as they are incurred. Store closing costs primarily consist of insurance deductibles, rent, and store payroll.

Self
‑
Insurance

Under a number of the Company’s insurance programs, which include the Company’s employee health insurance program, its workers’ compensation and
      general liability insurance programs, the Company is liable for a portion of its losses. The Company estimates the accrued liabilities for its self-insurance programs using historical claims experience and loss reserves. To limit the Company’s
      exposure to losses, a stop‑loss coverage is maintained through third‑party insurers.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
      consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
      measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more
      likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.

Ollie’s files consolidated federal and state income tax returns. For tax years prior to 2020, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income
      tax examinations. State income tax returns are filed in various state tax jurisdictions, as appropriate, with varying statutes of limitation and remain subject to examination for varying periods up to 
three
 to 
four years
 depending on the state.

(t)

Earnings per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per
      common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, after giving effect to the potential dilution, if applicable, from the assumed exercise of stock options into shares of common stock as if
      those stock options were exercised and the assumed lapse of restrictions on restricted stock units.

The following table summarizes those effects
      for the diluted earnings per common share calculation:

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable
      Segment Disclosures,” which modifies reportable segment disclosure requirements. This ASU expands annual and interim reportable segment disclosures, including: disclosure of the title and position of our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”),
      interim and annual disclosure of significant reportable segment expenses that are components of segment profit or loss information provided to the CODM, and interim disclosure of all annual reportable segment profit or loss and asset data currently
      only required to be disclosed annually. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We adopted ASU No. 2023-07 during the year ended
      February 1, 2025. See Note 12 “Segment Reporting and Entity-Wide Information” in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU
      2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which modifies the disclosure requirements for income taxes. This ASU requires disclosure of tabular statutory to effective rate reconciliation in both percentages and dollars, additional
      disaggregated rate reconciliation categories and disaggregation of both income taxes paid and income tax expense by jurisdiction. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We expect this ASU to only impact our
      disclosures with no impact to our result of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 “Income Statement–Reporting Comprehensive Income–Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses” (“ASU 2024-03”) which requires
        disaggregated disclosure of certain costs and expenses, including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization and depletion, within relevant income statement captions. This guidance is effective for annual reporting
        periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2024-03 to our consolidated
        financial statements.

We reviewed
          all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that they were either not applicable or not expected to have a significant impact to the consolidated financial statements.

Net Sales

Ollie’s recognizes retail sales in its stores when merchandise is sold and the customer takes possession of merchandise.  Also included in net
      sales is revenue allocated to certain redeemed discounts earned via the Ollie’s Army loyalty program, revenue from Ollie’s co-branded credit card, and gift card breakage.  Net sales are presented net of returns and sales tax. The Company provides an
      allowance for estimated retail merchandise returns based on prior experience.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is deferred for the Ollie’s Army loyalty program where members
        accumulate points that can be redeemed for discounts on future purchases.  The Company has determined it has an additional performance obligation to Ollie’s Army members at the time of the initial transaction.  The Company allocates the transaction
        price to the initial transaction and the discount awards based upon its relative standalone selling price, which considers historical redemption patterns for the award.  Revenue is recognized as those discount awards are redeemed.  Discount awards
        issued upon the achievement of specified point levels are subject to expiration.  
Unless temporarily extended, the maximum redemption period is 
45
 days.  At the end of each fiscal period, unredeemed discount awards and accumulated points to earn a future discount award are reflected as a
          liability.  Discount awards are combined in one homogeneous pool and are not separately identifiable.  Therefore, the revenue recognized consists of discount awards redeemed that were included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of
          the period as well as discount awards issued during the current period.

Gift card breakage for gift card liabilities not subject to escheatment is recognized as revenue in proportion to the redemption of gift cards. Gift
      cards do not expire. The rate applied to redemptions is based upon a historical breakage rate. Gift cards are combined in one homogenous pool and are not separately identifiable.  Therefore, the revenue recognized consists of gift cards that were

In fiscal 2024, the Company’s launched a co-branded credit card can be used by customers purchases at Ollie’s and everywhere else co-branded credit card is accepted, and credit is
          extended to such customers by a third-party financial institution on a non-recourse basis to the Company. The co-branded credit card includes a performance obligation for the Company which includes marketing and promoting the program on behalf of
          the back and the operation of the Company’s loyalty rewards program. Loyalty members earn points through purchases made using the card.

          The third party reimburses the Company for certain credit card program costs such as advertising and loyalty points, which help promote the credit card program. The Company recognizes revenue when collectability is reasonably assured, under the
          assumption the amounts are not constrained and it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods, which is generally the time at which the actual usage of the credit cards or specified transaction occurs.

          Under the program, the Company receives a percentage of the sales generated by Ollie’s co-branded Credit Card, in exchange for primary marketing functions. As a result, all amounts associated with the program are recognized within net sales on
          the consolidated statements of income. Additionally, the Company is entitled to certain bonuses based on performance of the program.

Leases

The Company accounts for its leases under ASC 842, Leases (Topic 842). Under this guidance, arrangements
        meeting the definition of a lease are classified as operating or financing leases and are recorded on the balance sheet as both a right-of-use asset and lease liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate
        implicit in the lease, if available. The Company’s lessors do not provide an implicit rate, nor is one readily available, therefore the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the portfolio approach, which applies one rate to leases
        within a given period. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right-of-use asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the
        right-of-use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term. Variable lease expenses, if any, are recorded when incurred.

In calculating the right-of-use asset and lease liability,
          the Company elects to combine lease and non-lease components. The Company excludes short-term leases having initial terms of 12 months or less from the guidance as an accounting policy election and recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis
          over the lease term.

Ollie’s generally leases its stores, offices, and distribution facilities under operating leases that
        expire at various dates through 2038.  These leases generally provide for fixed annual rentals.  A majority of the Company’s leases also require a payment for all or a portion of common-area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, water and
        sewer costs, and repairs, on a fixed or variable payment basis, the cost of which, for leases existing as of the adoption of ASC 842, is charged to the related expense category rather than being accounted for as rent expense.  For leases entered
        into after the adoption of ASC 842, the Company accounts for lease components together with non-lease components as a single component for all classes of underlying assets.  Most of the leases contain options to renew for 
three
 to 
five
 successive 
five-year
 periods.  The Company is generally not reasonably certain to exercise renewal options; therefore, the options are not considered in
        determining the lease term, and associated potential option payments are excluded from the lease payments.  Ollie’s lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

Debt Obligations and Financing Arrangements

Long-term debt consists of finance leases
.

The Company’s credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) provides for a 
five-year
 $
100.0
 million revolving credit facility, which
        includes a $
45.0
 million sub-facility for letters of credit and a $
25.0
 million sub-facility for swingline loans (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). In addition, the Company may at any time add term loan facilities or additional revolving
        commitments up to $
150.0
 million pursuant to terms and conditions set out in the Credit Facility. On January 9, 2024, the Company
        refinanced its credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), pursuant to which the maturity date for any loans under the revolving credit facility was extended for a period of 
five years
 from the effective date of January 9, 2024 and a zero percent (
0.0
%)
        interest rate floor was added to the option for the SOFR Loan Rate (as defined in the Amendment). Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility mature on 
January 9, 2029
.

 As a result of the anticipated discontinuation of LIBOR in 2023, on January 24, 2023, the Company amended its Credit Facility to
        replace the LIBOR-based interest rates included therein with SOFR-based interest rates and to modify the provisions for determining an alternative rate of interest upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the availability of interest rate
        benchmarks. The interest rates for the Credit Facility are calculated as follows: for ABR Loans, the highest of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 
0.50
% and Term SOFR with a term of 
one-month
 in effect on such day plus the SOFR Spread Adjustment
        plus 
1.0
%, plus the Applicable Margin, or, for SOFR Loans, the SOFR Loan Rate plus the Applicable Margin plus the SOFR Spread
        Adjustment. The Applicable Margin will vary from 
0.00
% to 
0.50
% for an ABR Loan and 
1.00
% to 
1.50
% for a SOFR Loan, based on availability under the Credit Facility. The SOFR Loan Rate is subject to a 
0
% floor.

Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, as of February 1, 2025, the Company could borrow up to 
90.0
% of the most recent appraised value (valued at cost, discounted for the current net orderly liquidation value) of its eligible inventory, as
        defined, up to $
100.0
 million.

As of February 1, 2025, the Company had 
no

        outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, with $
85.8
 million of borrowing availability, outstanding letters of credit
        commitments of $
14.0
 million, and $
0.2

        million of rent reserves. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains a variable unused line fee ranging from 
0.125
% to 
0.250
% per annum. The Company incurred unused line fees of $
0.1
 million in each of the years ended 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The Credit Facility is collateralized by the Company’s assets and equity and contains a financial covenant, as well as certain
        business covenants, including restrictions on dividend payments, which the Company must comply with during the term of the agreement.  The financial covenant is a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio test of at least 
1.0
 to 
1.0 applicable during a covenant period, based on reference
        to availability.  The Company was in compliance with all terms of the Credit Facility during 2024.

The provisions of the Credit Facility restrict all of the net assets of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries, which constitutes all
        of the net assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of February 1, 2025, from being used to pay any dividends or make other restricted payments to the Company without prior written consent from the financial institutions that are a
        party to the Credit Facility, subject to material exceptions including proforma compliance with the applicable conditions described in the Credit Facility.

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the
      deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the
      scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities (including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods), projected future taxable income, and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable
      income and projections for future taxable income and the scheduled reversal of deferred liabilities over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the
      benefits of these 
deductible differences as of
 February 1, 2025 
and February 3, 2024
.

Ollie’s has no material accrual for uncertain tax positions or
        interest or penalties related to income taxes on the Company’s 
consolidated balance sheets as of February 1, 2025 or February 3, 2024, and has 
no
t recognized any
        material uncertain tax positions or interest or penalties related to income taxes in the consolidated statements of income for 2024, 2023 or 2022
.

Equity Incentive Plans

During 2012, Ollie’s established an equity incentive plan (the “2012 Plan”) under which stock options were granted to executive officers and key
      employees as deemed appropriate under the provisions of the 2012 Plan, with an exercise price at the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. The vesting period for options granted under the 2012 Plan is 
five years
 (
20
% ratably per year).
      Options granted under the 2012 Plan are subject to employment for vesting, expire 
10 years
 from the date of grant, and are not
      transferable other than upon death. As of July 15, 2015, the date of the pricing of the Company’s initial public offering, no additional equity grants will be made under the 2012 Plan.

In connection with its initial public offering, the Company adopted the 2015 equity incentive plan (the “2015 Plan”) pursuant to which the Company’s
      Board of Directors may grant stock options, restricted shares or other awards to employees, directors and consultants.  The 2015 Plan allows for the issuance of up to 
5,250,000
 shares. Awards will be made pursuant to agreements and may be subject to vesting and other restrictions as determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee of the Board. The Company uses
      authorized and unissued shares to satisfy share award exercises. As of February 1, 2025, there were 
1,684,851
 shares available for grant
      under the 2015 Plan.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

The expected life of stock options is estimated using the “simplified method,” as the Company does not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment
        termination behavior for its stock option grants.  The simplified method is based on the average of the vesting tranches and the contractual life of each grant.  For expected volatility, the Company uses its historical information over the expected
        life of the option granted to calculate the fair value of option grants.  The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury notes with a term approximating the expected life of the option. 

Restricted Stock Units

Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) are issued at the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.  RSUs outstanding vest ratably
      over 
four years
 or cliff vest in 
one

      or 
four years
.  Awards are subject to employment for vesting and are not transferable other than upon death.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense

The compensation cost for stock options and RSUs recorded within SG&A
        was $
19.4
 million, $
12.2
 million, and $
10.0
 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In 2024, we recognized an accelerated expense of $
5.5
 million
          related to previously unrecognized compensation expense on the former CEO’s outstanding equity awards in connection with modification of his awards upon transition to Executive Chairman.

As of February 1, 2025, there was $
19.3

      million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock-based compensation arrangements. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 
2.5
 years. Compensation costs related to awards are recognized using the straight-line method.

Employee Benefit Plans

Ollie’s sponsors a defined contribution plan (the “Plan”), qualified under Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 401(k), for the benefit of employees.
      An employee becomes eligible to participate in the Plan upon attaining at least 
21 years
 of age and completing 
three months
 of full-time employment. An employee may elect to contribute annual compensation up to the maximum allowable under the IRC. The Company
      assumes all administrative costs of the Plan. Beginning January 2024, the Company transitioned to a safe harbor plan and increased matches for employee contributions to 
100
% of the first 
3
% contributed of employee’s annual compensation, and 
50
% of the next 
2
% contributed for
      a total match of up to 
4
%. Prior to the transition, the Company matched employee’s contributions up to 
25
% of the first 
6
% of their annual
      compensation and the portion that the Company matched vested ratably over 
six years
. The enhancements under the safe harbor plan also
      include 
100
% immediate vesting of the portion that the Company matches.  The employer matching contributions to the Plan were $
1.6
 million, $
0.4
 million, and $
0.3
 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

In addition to the regular matching contribution, the Company may elect to make a discretionary matching contribution. Discretionary contributions
      shall be allocated as a percentage of compensation of eligible participants for the Plan year. There were 
no
 discretionary
      contributions in 2024, 2023 or 2022.

Common Stock

Common Stock

The Company’s capital structure consists of a single class of common stock with 
one
 vote per share.  The Company has authorized 
500,000,000
 shares at $
0.001
 par value per share.  Additionally, the Company has authorized 
50,000,000
 shares of preferred stock at $
0.001
 par value per share; to date,
      however, 
no
 preferred shares have been issued.  Treasury stock, which consists of the Company’s common stock, is accounted for using the
      cost method.

Share Repurchase Program

On December 15, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $
100.0
 million of shares of the Company’s common stock. On March 16, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized an increase of $
100.0
 million in the Company’s share repurchase program.  Both of these authorizations were authorized to be executed through January 2023. On November
        30, 2021, the Board authorized an additional $
200.0
 million to repurchase stock pursuant to the Company’s share repurchase program,
        expiring on December 15, 2023. On November 30, 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an extension to the existing share repurchase program set to expire on December 15, 2023, until March 31, 2026. 

The shares to be repurchased may be purchased from time to time in open market conditions (including blocks), privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs or other derivative transactions, issuer self-tender
        offers, or any combination of the foregoing.  The timing of repurchases and the actual amount purchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the Company’s shares, general market, economic and business conditions, and
        other corporate considerations.  Repurchases may be made pursuant to plans intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which could allow the Company to purchase its shares during periods when it otherwise might be
        prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods.  Repurchases are expected to be funded from cash on hand or through the utilization of the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility.  The repurchase
        authorization does not require the purchase of a specific number of shares and is subject to suspension or termination by the Company’s Board of Directors at any time. 

During 2024, the Company repurchased 
639,788

      shares of its common stock for $
53.0
 million, inclusive of transaction costs, pursuant to its share repurchase program. During 2023, the
      Company repurchased 
808,669
 shares of its common stock for $
52.5
 million, inclusive of transaction costs, and during 2022, it repurchased 
848,133

      shares of its common stock for $
41.8
 million, inclusive of transaction costs.  These expenditures were funded by cash on hand.  As of
      February 1, 2025, the Company had $
32.7
 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.  There can be no assurances that any
      additional repurchases will be completed, or as to the timing or amount of any repurchases.

Segment Reporting and Entity-Wide Information

For purposes of the disclosure requirements for segments of a business enterprise, it has been determined that the Company is comprised of 
one
 operating segment and 
one
 reportable
      segment. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM regularly reviews operations and financial performance at a consolidated level, for purposes of assessing performance and allocating
      resources.

The CODM uses net income to allocate resources for the single segment to make decisions regarding annual budget, new store openings, landlord and
      vendor negotiations, marketing decisions, pursuing new business ventures, and driving the Company’s values. The CODM reviews asset information on a consolidated basis.

The following table summarizes the percentage of net sales by each product group for each year presented:

1.

Basis of presentation

In the parent-company-only condensed financial statements, Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc.’s (the “Company”) investment in subsidiaries
        is stated at cost plus equity in undistributed earnings of subsidiaries since the date of acquisition. The parent-company-only condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements. A
        condensed statement of cash flows was not presented because Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. had 
no
 cash flow activities during
        2024, 2023 or 2022.

2.

Guarantees and restrictions

On January 9, 2024, Ollie’s Bargain Outlet, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company,
        completed a transaction in which it refinanced its credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility provides for a 
five-year

$
100.0
 million
 revolving credit facility, which includes a 
$
45.0
 million
 sub-facility
          for letters of credit and a 
$
25.0
 million
 sub-facility for swingline loans (the “Revolving
          Credit Facility”).  The loans under the Revolving Credit Facility mature on 
January 9, 2029
.
  In
          addition, Ollie’s Bargain Outlet, Inc. may at any time add term loan facilities or additional revolving commitments up to 
$
150.0

        million
 pursuant to the terms and conditions set out in the Credit Facility.  Under the terms of the Credit Facility, Bargain Parent, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company, guaranteed the payment of all principal and
          interest. In the event of a default under the Credit Facility, Bargain Parent, Inc. will be directly liable to the debt holders
.

As of February 1, 2025
,
        Ollie’s Bargain Outlet, Inc. had $
85.8
 million available for borrowing under its Revolving Credit Facility.

The Credit Facility is collateralized by the Company’s assets and equity and contains a financial covenant, as well as certain business
      covenants, including restrictions on dividend payments, which the Company must comply with during the term of the agreement. The Company was in compliance with all terms of the agreement during and as of the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025.

The provisions of the Credit Facility restrict all of the net assets of the Company’s consolidated subsidiaries, which constitutes all of the
      net assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of 
February 1, 2025
, from being used to pay any dividends or make other restricted payments without prior written consent from the lenders under the
      Credit Facility, subject to certain exceptions.

Controls and Procedures

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarterly period ended February 1, 2025 that
      have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Security Exchange Act of 1934,
      as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
      specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and its Chief Financial Officer
      (principal financial and accounting officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

The Company’s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the
      Company’s disclosure controls and procedures under the Exchange Act as of February 1, 2025, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
      concluded that, as of February 1, 2025, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and
      maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding
      the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of
      effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as
      of February 1, 2025.  Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in 
Internal Control
        - Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management determined that, as of February 1, 2025, the Company maintained effective internal
      control over financial reporting at a reasonable assurance level.

The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2025 has been audited by KPMG LLP, our independent
      registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report dated March 26, 2025 that appears below.

Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2025,
      based on criteria established 
in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
      Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance
      sheets of the Company as of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended February 1, 2025, and the related notes
      and financial statement schedule I - condensed financial information of registrant (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated March 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
      internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
      based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the
      Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
      assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
      reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered
      necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
      reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
      the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
      financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
      reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation
      of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
