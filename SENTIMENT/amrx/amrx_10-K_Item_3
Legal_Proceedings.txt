Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K and other publicly available documents of Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States (“U.S.”) Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Management and representatives of Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“the Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “targets,” “estimates,” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other things: discussions of future operations; expected operating results and financial performance; impact of planned acquisitions and dispositions; our strategy for growth; product development; regulatory approvals; market position and expenditures.
Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or other factors or circumstances change, our actual results and financial condition could vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. Investors are therefore cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements.
