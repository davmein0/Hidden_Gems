Item 1. Business - Pharmaceutical Approval Process in the United States - New Drug Application and Biologics License Application
 for additional information.
Our Affordable Medicines segment includes approximately 270 product families covering an extensive range of dosage forms and delivery systems, including both immediate and extended-release oral solids, powders, liquids, sterile injectables, nasal sprays, inhalation and respiratory products, biosimilar products, ophthalmics, films, transdermal patches and topicals. We focus on developing products that have substantial barriers-to-entry due to complex drug formulations or manufacturing, or legal or regulatory challenges. Focusing on these products allows us the opportunity to offer first-to-file (“FTF”), first-to-market (“FTM”) and other high-value products to customers. A generic pharmaceutical product is considered an FTF product if the ANDA filed with respect to such product is the first to be filed for such product. Pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, FTF products may receive a statutory 180-day exclusivity period, subject to certain conditions. A generic product that does not qualify as an FTF may still be an FTM product. A generic product is considered an FTM product if it is the first marketed generic version of a branded pharmaceutical. FTF, FTM and high-value products tend to be more profitable and often have longer life cycles than other generic pharmaceuticals. As such, the timing of new product introductions can have a significant impact on our financial results. Market entry by additional competitors generally has a negative impact on the volume and pricing of the affected products. Additionally, pricing is often affected by factors outside of our control. Refer to “Pharmaceutical Approval Process in the United States,” below, for more information.
As of December 31, 2024, our Affordable Medicines segment had 76 products with a pending ANDA and another 56 products in various stages of development in our pipeline, 74% of which are non-oral solid products. We have an integrated, team-based approach to product development that combines our formulation, regulatory, legal, manufacturing and commercial capabilities.

Our Affordable Medicines segment has a growing portfolio of institutional injectable products primarily for the U.S. hospital market. Our R&D pipeline has prioritized new product innovations in injectables, such as drug/device combinations, peptides, long-acting injectables and large volume parenteral bags. We have expanded our manufacturing capabilities and infrastructure to support the needs of this expanding business with a focus on development, commercialization and scaling a differentiated injectables portfolio. During 2023, we launched 39 new products, of which 14 were injectables. In May 2023, the FDA approved for manufacturing our fourth and largest injectable site. During 2024, we launched 22 new products, of which 12 were injectables.
In 2022 we began to commercialize an initial portfolio of oncology biosimilars in the U.S. Alymsys
®
, a biosimilar referencing Avastin
®
, launched in October 2022, followed by Releuko
®
, a biosimilar referencing Neupogen
®
, in November 2022 and Flynetra™, a biosimilar referencing Neulasta
®
, in May 2023. On October 12, 2023, we announced the addition of two denosumab biosimilars referencing both Prolia
®
 and XGEVA
®
 to our biosimilar pipeline. The two denosumab products are being developed by mAbxience S.L., a global biotech company with over a decade of experience in the development, manufacture, and commercialization of biopharmaceuticals. To further grow our oncology biosimilars sales, we are focused on serving oncology clinics, integrated health systems and specialty pharmacies. We are focused on expanding our oncology and biosimilar portfolio with additional molecules, and we seek to vertically integrate by expanding our biosimilar capabilities.
In March 2024, we amended the Kashiv Biosimilar Agreement (as defined in 
Note 23. Related Party Transactions
) to include two additional in-development products, a pre-filled auto-injector delivery system for peg-filgrastim and a pre-filled on-body injector (OBI) delivery system for peg-filgrastim. In July 2024, we entered into an exclusive license and commercialization agreement with Kashiv Biosciences LLC to distribute and sell Omalizumab, a biosimilar to XOLAIR
®
, in the U.S. and India (refer to 
Note 23. Related Party Transactions
.)
Our Affordable Medicines segment had net revenue of $1.69 billion, $1.47 billion and $1.43 billion and operating income of $270.1 million, $276.2 million and $224.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Specialty
Our Specialty segment is engaged in the development, promotion, sale and distribution of proprietary branded pharmaceutical products, with a focus on products addressing central nervous system (“CNS”) disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, and endocrine disorders. Our portfolio of products includes CREXONT
®
 (combination of carbidopa and levodopa extended release capsules), RYTARY
®
 (extended release oral capsule formulation of carbidopa-levodopa), UNITHROID
®
 (levothyroxine sodium), and ONGENTYS
®
 (opicapone). On August 7, 2024, the FDA approved our new drug application (“NDA”) for CREXONT
®
, previously referred to as IPX203. In September 2024, we began selling CREXONT
®
, which is indicated for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, Parkinson’s disease caused by infection or inflammation of the brain, or Parkinson’s disease-like symptoms that may result from carbon monoxide or manganese poisoning in adults. RYTARY
®
 is indicated for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, post-encephalitic parkinsonism, and parkinsonism that may follow carbon monoxide intoxication or manganese intoxication. ONGENTYS
®
 is an add-on treatment to carbidopa/levodopa in patients with Parkinson’s disease experiencing “off” episodes, which we commenced selling in early 2024 under a license agreement with BIAL-Portela & Ca., S.A. UNITHROID
®
, indicated for the treatment of hypothyroidism, is sold under a license and distribution agreement with Jerome Stevens Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
Our Specialty products are marketed through skilled specialty sales and marketing teams, who call on neurologists, movement disorder specialists, endocrinologists and primary care physicians throughout the U.S. Our Specialty segment also has other product candidates that are in varying stages of development.
For Specialty products, the majority of such products’ commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity. In the U.S., when market exclusivity expires and generic versions of a product are approved and marketed, there can often be substantial and rapid declines in the branded product’s sales.  In 2025, we expect to lose exclusivity for RYTARY
®
, an extended-release oral capsule formulation of carbidopa-levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease.
Our Specialty segment had net revenue of $445.7 million, $390.5 million and $374.1 million and operating income of $113.6 million, $65.3 million and $72.6 million, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Geographic Areas
We operate in the U.S., India, and Ireland. Investments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S. activities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in international economies, more restrictive economic policies and higher political and legal system uncertainties.
