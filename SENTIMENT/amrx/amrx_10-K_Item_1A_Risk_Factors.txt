Item 1A. Risk Factors
 and 
Note 6. Income Taxes 
in our consolidated financial statements, we are a party to a TRA under which we are generally required to pay to the Amneal Group 75% of the applicable tax savings, if any, in U.S. federal and state income tax that we are deemed to realize and that are created as a result of tax benefits attributable to payments made under the TRA.
The timing and amount of any payments under the TRA may vary, depending upon a number of factors including the timing and amount of our taxable income, and the tax rate in effect at the time of realization of the our taxable income. Because the Amneal Group has sold or exchanged all of their Amneal Common Units, effective with the Reorganization, there is no longer the associated risk of increased future obligations under the TRA (i.e., there cannot be further sales or exchanges giving rise to increased TRA liability occurring subsequent to December 31, 2023).
The projection of future taxable income involves significant judgment. Actual taxable income may differ materially from our estimates, which could significantly impact the timing and payment of the TRA. As noted above, we have determined it is more-likely-than-not we will be unable to utilize all of our DTAs subject to the TRA; and, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had not recognized the entire contingent liability under the TRA related to the tax savings we may realize from Amneal Common Units sold or exchanged. If utilization of these DTAs becomes more-likely-than-not in the future, at such time, these TRA liabilities (which amount to approximately $133.8 million as of December 31, 2024, as a result of basis adjustments under Internal Revenue Code Section 754) will be recorded through charges to our statements of operations.

However, if the tax attributes are not utilized in future years, it is reasonably possible no amounts would be paid under the TRA in excess of the $53.9 million accrued as of December 31, 2024.

Should we determine that a DTA with a valuation allowance is realizable in a subsequent period, the related valuation allowance will be reversed and if a resulting TRA payment is determined to be probable, a corresponding TRA liability will be recorded.
Contingencies
We are involved in various litigation, government investigations and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Our legal proceedings are complex, constantly evolving and subject to uncertainty. As such, we cannot predict the outcome or impact of our legal proceedings.
While we believe we have valid claims and/or defenses for the matters described in 
Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies,
 the nature of litigation is unpredictable and the outcome of the proceedings could include damages, fines, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies. For any proceedings where losses are probable and reasonably capable of estimation, we accrue for a potential loss. When we have a probable loss for which a reasonable estimate of the liability is a range of losses and no amount within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, we record the loss at the low end of the range. While these accruals have been deemed reasonable by our management, the assessment process relies heavily on estimates and assumptions that may ultimately prove inaccurate or incomplete. Additionally, unforeseen circumstances or events may lead us to subsequently change our estimates and assumptions. The process of analyzing, assessing and establishing reserve estimates relative to legal proceedings involves a high degree of judgment.
The ultimate resolution of any or all claims, legal proceedings or investigations are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, could differ materially from our estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or cash flows in any given accounting period, or on our overall financial condition.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Our cash is held on deposit in demand accounts at large financial institutions in amounts in excess of the FDIC insurance coverage limit of $250,000 per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category. Our cash equivalents are comprised of highly rated money market funds. We had no short-term investments as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents and accounts receivable. We limit our credit risk associated with cash equivalents by placing investments with high credit quality securities, including U.S. government securities, treasury bills, corporate debt, short-term commercial paper and highly rated money market funds. As discussed in 
Note 15. Debt
, we are party to term loans with an aggregate principal amount of $2.5 billion, the Amended New Revolving Credit Facility and the Amended Rondo Revolving Credit Facility under which loans and letters of credit up to a principal amount of $495.2 million and 
$28.0 million 
are available as of December 31, 2024, respectively (principal amount of up to 
$20.2 million
 and $18.0 million

remain available for letters of credit, respectively). The proceeds for any loans made under our asset backed revolving credit facility are available for capital expenditures, acquisitions, working capital needs and other general corporate purposes. 
In January 2025, the Company paid the entire remaining principal balance of $192.0 million outstanding on its Term Loan Due 2025, plus accrued interest thereon of $0.7 million, with $190.0 million of new borrowings under the Amended New Revolving Credit Facility and cash on hand.  
We limit our credit risk with respect to accounts receivable by performing credit evaluations when deemed necessary. We do not require collateral to secure amounts owed to us by our customers.
By the nature of our global operations, we are exposed to cash flow and earnings fluctuations resulting from foreign exchange rate variation. These exposures are transactional and translational in nature. Since we manufacture and sell our products throughout the world, we believe our foreign currency risk is diversified. Principal drivers of this diversified foreign exchange exposure include the European Euro and the Indian Rupee. Our transactional exposure arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than the functional currency of our operational units. We also have exposure related to the translation of financial statements of our foreign divisions into U.S. dollars, our functional currency. The financial statements of our operations outside the U.S. are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Adjustments to translate the assets and liabilities of these foreign operations into U.S. dollars are accumulated as a component of other comprehensive loss. Transaction gains and losses are included in the determination of our net loss in our statements of operations. Such foreign currency transaction gains and losses include fluctuations related to long term intercompany loans that are payable in the foreseeable future.
While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation, we estimate our business did not experience a material increase in costs due to inflation for the year ended December 31, 2024. We do not expect a material impact related to inflation for the year ending December 31, 2025. However, rising inflationary pressures due to higher input costs, including higher material, transportation, labor and other costs, could exceed our expectations and may adversely impact our operating results in future periods.
In the normal course of operations, we are exposed to market risks relating to our long-term debt arising from adverse changes in interest rates.  Market risk is defined for these purposes as the potential change in the fair value of a financial asset or liability resulting from an adverse movement in interest rates. Changes in interest rates impact fixed and variable rate debt differently. For fixed rate debt, a change in interest rates will impact only the fair value of the debt, whereas for variable rate debt, a change in the interest rates will impact interest expense and cash flows. 
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $2.48 billion and $2.54 billion, respectively, of variable rate debt. Our debt as of December 31, 2024 comprised of our Term Loan Due 2028 with principal outstanding of $2.29 billion and our Term Loan Due 2025 with principal outstanding of $192.0 million. We estimated the fair values of the Term Loan Due 2028 and Term Loan Due 2025 using quoted prices in active markets and yields for the same or similar types of borrowings, taking into account the underlying terms of the debt instruments. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we estimated the fair value of the Term Loan Due 2025 to be $192.6 million and $190.8 million, respectively. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we estimated the fair value of the Term Loan Due 2028 to be $2.36 billion and $2.33 billion, respectively.  
In October 2019, we entered into an interest rate lock agreement for a total notional amount of $1.3 billion whereby we exchanged floating for fixed rate interest payments for our LIBOR based borrowing under our Term Loan Due 2025 (the 
66
“October 2019 Swap”). On May 31, 2023, we executed an amendment to the interest rate swap that changed the reference rate from LIBOR to the one-month secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”). 
On November 14, 2023, in connection with our refinancing of the Term Loan Due 2025 and the New Credit Facility, as defined in 
Note 15. Debt
, 
we novated the October 2019 Swap to another counterparty and, in connection with such novation, amended the October 2019 Swap. Specifically, the amendments modified (i) the fixed rate payable by the counterparty from 1.3660% to a new fixed rate of 2.7877% and (ii) extended the termination date through May 4, 2027 (i.e., one year before the Term Loan Due 2028 matures). The amendments did not change the notional amount of $1.3 billion. 
Refer to 
Note 19. Financial Instruments
 for additional information. At inception and at year end, we assessed hedge effectiveness and determined it to continue to be highly effective. We also reviewed the credit standing of the counterparty at year end and deemed the counterparties to have the ability to honor their obligations. The fair value of the variable-to-fixed interest rate swap was an asset of $35.9 million as of December 31, 2024. We estimated that a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the forward one-month SOFR curve would potentially increase the fair value of the variable-to-fixed interest rate swap asset by $27.0 million as of December 31, 2024. We estimated that a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in the forward one-month SOFR curve would potentially decrease the fair value of the variable-to fixed interest rate swap asset by $28.2 million as of December 31, 2024.
Increases or decreases in interest rates would affect our annual interest expense. Based on the principal amount of the Term Loan Due 2028 outstanding as of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have affected our annual interest expense by approximately $22.9 million, before the impact of the interest rate lock agreement discussed above. Based on the principal amount of the Term Loan Due 2025 outstanding as of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have affected our annual interest expense by approximately $1.9 million.
In January 2025, the Company paid the entire remaining principal balance of $192.0 million outstanding on its Term Loan Due 2025, plus accrued interest thereon of $0.7 million, with $190.0 million of new borrowings under the Amended New Revolving Credit Facility and cash on hand.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management, with the participation of our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. Ernst & Young LLP has independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below.
67
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During the quarter ended December 31, 2024, there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting which materially affected, or are reason
ably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitation on Effective Controls
Management, including our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our system of internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed or operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system of internal control are met. The design of our control system reflects the fact that there are resource constraints, and that the benefits of such control system must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control failures and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the intentional acts of individuals, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that the design of any particular control will always succeed in achieving its objective under all potential future conditions.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
We have audited Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria. 
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders’ equity (deficiency) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss
,
 changes in stockholders’ equity (deficiency) and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters 
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Medicaid Rebates
Description of the Matter
As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales based on amounts due from customers net of allowances for variable consideration, which include, among others, rebates mandated by law under Medicaid and other government pricing programs. The Company includes an estimate of variable consideration in its transaction price at the time of sale, when control of the product transfers to the customer. The Company estimates its Medicaid and other government pricing accruals based on monthly sales, historical experience of claims submitted by the various states and jurisdictions, historical rebate rates and estimated lag time of the rebate invoices. At December 31, 2024, the Company had $135 million in accrued Medicaid and commercial rebates, which are presented within accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet.
Auditing the allowances for Medicaid rebates was complex and challenging due to the significant estimation involved in management’s assumptions to calculate expected future claims and the amount of projected shipments from wholesalers that will be dispensed to eligible benefit plan participants, as well as the complexity of governmental pricing calculations. The allowances for Medicaid rebates are sensitive to these significant assumptions and calculations.  
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management’s review of the allowances for Medicaid rebates. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions including the completeness and accuracy of inputs utilized in significant assumptions as well as controls over management’s review of the application of the government pricing regulations.
To test the allowances for Medicaid rebates, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the methodologies used and testing the significant assumptions discussed above. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to historical trends, evaluated the change in the accruals from prior periods, and assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates against actual results. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the Company’s calculations through third-party invoices, claims data and actual cash payments. In addition, we involved our government pricing subject matter professionals to assist in evaluating management’s methodology and calculations used to measure certain estimated rebates.
F-2
Sales Returns
Description of the Matter

As discussed in Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company permits the return of product under certain circumstances, including product expiration, shipping errors, damaged product, and product recalls. The Company accrues for the customer’s right to return as part of its variable consideration at the time of sale, when control of the product transfers to the customer. The Company’s product returns accrual is primarily based on estimates of future product returns, estimates of the level of inventory of its products in the distribution channel that remain subject to returns, estimated lag time of returns and historical return rates. At December 31, 2024, the Company had $160 million in accrued returns allowance, which are presented within accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet.
Auditing the allowance for sales returns was complex due to the significant estimation required in determining inventory in the distribution channel that will not ultimately be sold to the end user and returned. The allowances for sales returns is sensitive to the level of inventory and turnover of inventory in the distribution channel, which could exceed future market demand and be subject to return.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls over the estimation of sales returns. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions including review of the inventory on hand in the distribution channel, estimated lag time of returns, and the completeness and accuracy of inputs utilized in the estimate of sales returns.
To test the estimated sales return reserve, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing the historical return rate and estimated lag time of returns and verifying the completeness and accuracy of sales data and sales returns data used in calculating the historical return rate and lag time. In addition, we tested the Company’s quarterly analysis of inventory in the distribution channel and analytically reviewed daily sales at period end for unusual activity. We also performed direct inquiries with management including the Sales and Legal departments, obtained representations confirming key contract terms at period end from the executive sales representatives, and agreed representations obtained to executed contracts and reserve calculations.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1. 
Nature of Operations 
Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company”) is a global biopharmaceutical company that develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes a diverse portfolio of essential medicines. The Company’s Affordable Medicines segment includes retail generics, injectables, and biosimilars.  In its Specialty segment, the Company offers a portfolio of branded pharmaceuticals focused primarily on central nervous system and endocrine disorders. Through the Company’s AvKARE segment, it is a distributor of pharmaceuticals and other products for the U.S. federal government, retail, and institutional markets. The Company operates principally in the United States (“U.S.”), India, and Ireland. R
efer to 
Note 25. Segment Information
 for an overview of our segments, including the change in segment name from “Generics” to “Affordable Medicines” during the fourth quarter of 2024.
The Company is a holding company, whose principal assets are common units (“Amneal Common Units”) of Amneal Pharmaceuticals, LLC (“Amneal”).  Immediately prior to the Reorganization (as defined herein), the Company held 
50.4
% of the Amneal Common Units and the group, together with their affiliates and certain assignees, who owned Amneal when it was a private company (the “Members” or the “Amneal Group”) held the remaining 
49.6
%. On November 7, 2023, the Company implemented a plan pursuant to which the Company and Amneal reorganized and simplified the Company’s corporate structure by eliminating its umbrella partnership-C-corporation structure and converting to a more traditional C-corporation structure whereby all stockholders hold their voting and economic interests directly through the public company (the “Reorganization”). Effective with the Reorganization, the Company holds 
100
% of the Amneal Common Units.
Following the implementation of the Reorganization, Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Old PubCo”) became a wholly owned subsidiary of a new holding company, Amneal NewCo Inc. (“New PubCo”), which replaced Old PubCo as the public company trading on the New York Stock Exchange under Old PubCo’s ticker symbol “AMRX.” In addition, New PubCo changed its name to “Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.” and Old PubCo changed its name to “Amneal Intermediate, Inc.” In connection with the Reorganization, holders of shares of Class A common stock, par value $
0.01
 per share, of Old PubCo (“Old PubCo Class A Common Stock”) ceased to hold such shares and received an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock, par value $
0.01
 per share, of New PubCo that have the same voting and economic rights as Old PubCo Class A Common Stock. Additionally, holders of shares of Class B common stock, par value $
0.01
 per share, of Old PubCo (“Old PubCo Class B Common Stock”), ceased to hold such shares and received an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock, par value $
0.01
 per share, of New PubCo that have the same voting and economic rights as Old PubCo Class A Common Stock. All outstanding shares of Old PubCo Class B Common Stock were surrendered and canceled. Accordingly, upon consummation of the Reorganization, Old PubCo stockholders automatically became stockholders of New PubCo, on a 
one
-for-one basis, with the same number and ownership percentage of shares they held in Old PubCo immediately prior to the effective time of the Reorganization. On December 27, 2023, the Company voluntarily withdrew the listing of its Class A common stock from the New York Stock Exchange and transferred the listing to the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC under the same name and ticker symbol.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Accounting Principles
The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all entities controlled by the Company, including Amneal and its subsidiaries, through the Company’s direct or indirect ownership of a majority voting interest. The Company records non-controlling interests for the portion of its subsidiaries’ economic interests that it does not hold. 
Although the Company had a minority economic interest in Amneal prior to March 31, 2023, it was Amneal’s sole managing member (and it continues to be the sole managing member), having the sole voting power to make all of Amneal’s business decisions and control its management. Therefore, the Company also consolidated the financial statements of Amneal and its subsidiaries for all periods prior to the Reorganization.

F-12
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported financial position at the date of the financial statements and the reported results of operations during the reporting period. Such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The following are some, but not all, of such estimates: the determination of chargebacks, sales returns, rebates, billbacks, valuation of intangible and other assets acquired in business combinations, allowances for accounts receivable, accrued liabilities, liabilities for legal matters, contingent liabilities, initial and subsequent valuation of contingent consideration recognized in business combinations, stock-based compensation, valuation of inventory balances, the determination of useful lives for product rights and the assessment of expected cash flows used in evaluating goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition
When assessing its revenue recognition, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies the performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue when it transfers control of its products to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products.
From time to time, the Company may enter into arrangements where it licenses certain products to a third-party distributor. Licensing arrangement performance obligations generally include intellectual property (“IP”) rights and research and development (“R&D”) and contract manufacturing services. The Company accounts for IP rights and services separately if they are distinct. The consideration is allocated between IP rights and services based on their relative stand-alone selling prices.
Revenue for distinct IP rights is accounted for based on the nature of the promise to grant the license. In determining whether the Company’s promise is to provide a right to access its IP or a right to use its IP, the Company considers the nature of the IP to which the customer will have rights. IP is either functional IP which has significant standalone functionality or symbolic IP which does not have significant standalone functionality. Revenue from functional IP is recognized at the point in time when control of the distinct license is transferred to the customer. Revenue from symbolic IP is recognized over the access period to the Company’s IP.
Revenue from sales-based milestones and royalties promised in exchange for a license of IP is recognized only when, or as, the later of subsequent sale or the performance obligation to which some or all of the sales-based royalty has been allocated, is satisfied.
For further details on the Company’s revenue recognition policies, refer to 
Note 4. Revenue Recognition.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company’s stock-based compensation consists of stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and market performance-based restricted stock units (“MPRSUs”) awarded to employees and non-employee directors. Stock options are measured at their fair value on the grant date or date of modification, as applicable. RSUs, including MPRSUs, are measured at the stock price on the grant date or date of modification, as applicable. The Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service and/or performance period, as applicable. Forfeitures of awards are accounted for as a reduction in stock-based compensation expense in the period such awards are forfeited. The Company's policy is to issue new shares upon option exercises and the vesting of RSUs and MPRSUs.
Contingent consideration
Business acquisitions may include future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain pharmaceutical regulatory milestones or net sales of pharmaceutical products. For acquisitions that are accounted for as a business combination, the obligations for such contingent consideration payments are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date. For contingent milestone payments, the Company uses a probability-weighted income approach utilizing an appropriate discount rate. For contingent tiered royalties on net sales, the Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model. Contingent consideration liabilities are revalued to fair value at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, other than changes due to payments, are recognized as a gain or loss and recorded within change in fair value of contingent consideration 
F-13
in the consolidated statements of operations.
 Refer to 
Note 3. Acquisition
 and 
Note 18. Fair Value Measurements
 for additional information.
Foreign Currencies
The Company has operations in the U.S., India, Ireland, and other foreign jurisdictions. Generally, the Company’s foreign operating subsidiaries’ functional currency is the local currency. The results of its non-U.S. dollar based operations are translated to U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates during the period. Assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income and non-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheets and are included in comprehensive loss. Transaction gains and losses are included in net loss in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations as a component of foreign exchange (loss) gain, net. Such foreign currency transaction gains and losses include fluctuations related to long-term intercompany loans that are payable in the foreseeable future. Translation gains and losses on intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature are included in foreign currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income and non-controlling interests, and comprehensive loss.

Business Combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, the acquiring entity in a business combination records the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition at their fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets and other identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related costs, primarily professional fees, are expensed as incurred.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. A portion of the Company’s cash flows are derived outside the U.S. As a result, the Company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company maintains cash balances at both U.S.-based and international-based commercial banks. At various times during the year, cash balances in the U.S. may exceed amounts that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Restricted Cash
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had restricted cash balances of $
7.9
 million and $
7.6
 million, respectively, in its bank accounts primarily related to the purchase of certain land and equipment in India.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses
Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company limits its credit risk with respect to accounts receivable by performing credit evaluations when deemed necessary. The Company does not require collateral to secure amounts owed to it by its customers.
Trade accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value. The allowance for credit losses reflects the best estimate of expected credit losses of the accounts receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, current information, and forecasts of future economic conditions. The Company determines its allowance methodology by pooling receivable balances at the customer level. The Company considers various factors, including its previous loss history, individual credit risk associated to each customer, and the current and future condition of the general economy. These credit risk factors are monitored on a quarterly basis and updated as necessary. To the extent that any individual debtor is identified whose credit quality has deteriorated, the Company establishes allowances based on the individual risk characteristics of such customer. The Company makes concerted efforts to collect all outstanding balances due from customers; however, account balances are charged off against the allowance when management believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to customers.
Chargebacks Received from Manufacturers
When a sale occurs on a contracted item, the difference between the cost the Company pays to the manufacturer of that item and the contract price that the end customer has with the manufacturer is rebated to the Company by the manufacturer as a chargeback. Chargebacks are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales and either a reduction in the amount due to the manufacturer (if there is a right of offset) or as a receivable from the manufacturer.

F-14
Inventories
Inventories consist of finished goods held for sale, raw materials, and work in process. Inventories are stated at net realizable value, with cost determined using the first-in, first-out method. Adjustments for excess and obsolete inventories are established based upon historical experience and management’s assessment of current product demand. These assessments include inventory obsolescence based on its expiration date, damaged or rejected product, and slow-moving products.
Property, Plant, and Equipment
Property, plant, and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. 
Depreciation expense is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:
Asset Classification

Estimated Useful Life
Buildings

30
 years
Computer equipment

5
 years
Furniture and fixtures

7
 years
Leasehold improvements

Shorter of asset's useful life or remaining life of lease
Machinery and equipment

5
 - 
10
 years
Vehicles

5
 years
Upon retirement or disposal, the cost of the asset disposed and the accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any gain or loss is reflected as part of operating income (loss) in the period of disposal. Expenditures that significantly increase value or extend useful lives of property, plant, and equipment are capitalized, whereas those for normal maintenance and repairs are expensed. The Company capitalizes interest on borrowings during the construction period of major capital projects as part of the related asset and amortizes the capitalized interest into earnings over the related asset’s remaining useful life.
Leases
All significant lease arrangements are recognized as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities at lease commencement. ROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the future lease payments using the Company's incremental borrowing rate.
Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. At each balance sheet date, operating and financing lease liabilities continue to represent the present value of the future payments. Financing lease ROU assets are expensed using the straight-line method, unless another basis is more representative of the pattern of economic benefit, to lease expense. Interest on financing lease liabilities is recognized in interest expense.
Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (short-term leases) are not recognized in the balance sheet and the related lease payments are recognized as incurred over the lease term. The Company separates lease and non-lease components. A portion of the Company's real estate leases are subject to periodic changes in the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”). The changes to the CPI are treated as variable lease payments and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments was incurred.
For further details regarding the Company's leases, refer to 
Note 17. Leases
.
In-Process Research and Development
The fair value of in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) acquired in a business combination is determined based on the present value of each research project’s projected cash flows using an income approach. Revenues are estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors, expected industry trends, individual project life cycles and the life of each research project’s underlying marketability. In determining the fair value of each research project, expected cash flows are adjusted for certain risks of completion, including technical and regulatory risk.
The value attributable to IPR&D projects at the time of acquisition is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and tested for impairment until the project is completed or abandoned. Upon completion of the project, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern is not 
F-15
readily determinable, on a straight-line basis. If the project is abandoned, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is charged to expense.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives, including IPR&D, are tested for impairment if impairment indicators arise and, at a minimum, annually. However, an entity is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary. Further testing is only required if the entity determines, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. Otherwise, no further impairment testing is required. The indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment test consists of a one-step analysis that compares the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company considers many factors in evaluating whether the value of its intangible assets with indefinite lives may not be recoverable, including, but not limited to, expected growth rates, the cost of equity and debt capital, general economic conditions, the Company’s outlook and market performance of the Company’s industry and recent and forecasted financial performance.
Goodwill
Goodwill, which represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired, is carried at cost. Goodwill is not amortized; rather, it is subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test. The Company reviews goodwill for possible impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
In order to test goodwill for impairment, an entity is permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether a quantitative assessment of goodwill is necessary. The qualitative factors considered by the Company may include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions, the Company’s outlook, market performance of the Company’s industry and recent and forecasted financial performance. Further testing is only required if the entity determines, based on the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. Otherwise, no further impairment testing is required. If a quantitative assessment is required, the Company determines the fair value of its reporting unit using a combination of the income and market approaches. If the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company recognizes a goodwill impairment charge for the reporting unit equal to the lesser of (i) the total goodwill allocated to that reporting unit and (ii) the amount by which that reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value. See 
Note 12. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
, for further discussion of the Company's qualitative and quantitative assessments of goodwill.
Assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long-lived assets, which could result in impairment charges in future periods. Such assumptions include projections of future cash flows and the current fair value of the asset.
Amortization of Intangible Assets with Finite Lives
Intangible assets, other than indefinite-lived intangible assets, are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset based on the pattern in which the economic benefits are expected to be consumed or otherwise used up or, if that pattern is not readily determinable, on a straight-line basis. The useful life is the period over which the assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows. Intangible assets are not written-off in the period of acquisition unless they become impaired during that period. 
The Company regularly evaluates the remaining useful life of each intangible asset that is being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If the estimate of the intangible asset’s remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life.
 See 
Note 12. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 for further discussion of the Company’s intangible assets.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets (Including Intangible Assets with Finite Lives)
The Company reviews its long-lived assets, including intangible assets with finite lives, for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The Company evaluates assets for potential impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted net cash flows to the carrying amount of the asset. If the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, impairment is measured based on the difference between the carrying amount of the assets and fair value, which is generally an expected present value cash flow technique. Management’s policy in determining whether an impairment indicator exists comprises measurable operating 
F-16
performance criteria as well as other qualitative measures.
 See 
Note 12. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
 for further discussion of the Company’s assessment of intangible asset impairments.
Financial Instruments
The Company minimizes its risks from interest fluctuations through its normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. The Company does not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract.
All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income net of income taxes and subsequently amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the period during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings, which is when the Company recognizes interest expense on the hedged cash flows. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item.
Highly effective hedging relationships that use interest rate swaps as the hedging instrument and that meet criteria under ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging 
(“ASC 815”), may qualify for the “short-cut method” of assessing effectiveness. The short-cut method allows the Company to make the assumption of no ineffectiveness, which means that the change in fair value of the hedged item can be assumed to be equal to the change in fair value of the derivative. Unless critical terms change, no further evaluation of effectiveness is performed for these hedging relationships unless a critical term is changed.
For a hedging relationship that does not qualify for the short-cut method, the Company measures its effectiveness using the “hypothetical derivative method”, in which the change in fair value of the hedged item must be measured separately from the change in fair value of the derivative. At inception and quarterly thereafter, the Company formally assesses whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. The Company compares the change in the fair value of the actual interest rate derivative to the change in the fair value of a hypothetical interest rate derivative with critical terms that match the hedged interest rate payments. After the initial quantitative assessment, this analysis is performed on a qualitative basis and, if it is determined that the hedging relationship was and continues to be highly effective, no further analysis is required.
All components of each derivative financial instrument's gain or loss are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness. If it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting and any deferred gains or losses related to a discontinued cash flow hedge shall continue to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income net of income taxes, unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur. If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the originally specified time period, the Company discontinues hedge accounting, and any deferred gains or losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income are reclassified into earnings immediately.
The Company is subject to credit risk as a result of nonperformance by counterparties to the derivative agreements. Upon inception and quarterly thereafter, the Company makes judgments on each counterparty’s creditworthiness for nonperformance by counterparties.
Income Taxes
The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, 
Accounting for Income Taxes
 (“ASC 740”), which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expenses on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of its assets and liabilities by applying the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Such net tax effects on temporary differences are reflected on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when the Company believes that it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
ASC 740-10 prescribes a two-step approach for the recognition and measurement of tax benefits associated with the positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. The Company has reviewed and will continue to review the conclusions reached regarding uncertain tax positions, which may be subject to review 
F-17
and adjustment at a later date based on ongoing analyses of tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. To the extent that the Company’s assessment of the conclusions reached regarding uncertain tax positions changes as a result of the evaluation of new information, such change in estimate will be recorded in the period in which such determination is made. The Company reports income tax-related interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions, if applicable, as a component of income tax expense.
Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss includes net loss and all changes in stockholders’ equity (except those arising from transactions with stockholders) including foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the consolidation of foreign subsidiaries’ financial statements and unrealized (losses) gains on cash flows hedges, net of income taxes.
Research and Development
R&D activities are expensed as incurred. R&D expenses primarily consist of direct and allocated expenses incurred with the process of formulation, clinical research, and validation associated with new product development. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with R&D collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval or when there is no alternative future use.
Intellectual Property Legal Development Expenses
The Company expenses external IP legal development expenses as incurred. These costs relate to legal challenges of innovator’s patents for invalidity or non-infringement, which are customary in the generic pharmaceutical industry, and are incurred predominately during development of a product and prior to regulatory approval. Associated costs include, but are not limited to, formulation assessments, patent challenge opinions and strategy, and litigation expenses to defend the IP supporting the Company's regulatory filings.
Shipping Costs
The Company records the costs of shipping product to its customers as a component of selling, general, and administrative expenses as incurred.
 Shipping costs were $
18.9
 million, $
21.7
 million and $
18.7
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures 
(“ASU 2023-07”), which provides improvements to reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 requires disclosures to include the title and position of the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM, a description of other segment items by reportable segment, and any additional measures of a segment’s profit or loss used by the CODM when deciding how to allocate resources. ASU 2023-07 also requires all annual disclosures currently required by Topic 280 to be included in interim periods. The Company adopted the annual and interim disclosure requirements of ASU 2023-07 effective December 31, 2024 (refer to 
Note 25. Segment Information
).  The adoption of this ASU only affects the Company’s disclosures, with no impact to its financial condition and results of operations.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures 
(“ASU 2023-09”), which enhances the transparency and usefulness of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023-09 requires that public business entities on an annual basis disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
F-18
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03,
 Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
 (“ASU 2024-03”), which requires a public business entity to provide disaggregated disclosures, in the notes to the financial statements, of certain categories of expenses that are included in expense line items on the face of the income statement. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, ASU 2024-03 may be applied prospectively for reporting periods after the effective date or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.
Reclassification
The prior period balances related to the TRA (as defined in 
Note 6. Income Taxes
) of $
3.1
 million and $
0.6
 million, formerly included in “Other income, net”, for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, have been reclassified to the income statement caption “Increase in tax receivable agreement liability” to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated statements of operations. This reclassification did not impact total other expense, net or net income.
The prior period balance related to long-term liabilities for legal matters of $
0.3
 million, formerly included in “Other long-term liabilities” as of December 31, 2023, has been reclassified to the balance sheet caption “Liabilities for legal matters - long term” to conform to the current period presentation in the consolidated balance sheets. This reclassification did not impact total long-term liabilities or total liabilities.

Acquisition
Saol Baclofen Franchise Acquisition 
On December 30, 2021, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with certain entities affiliated with Saol International Limited (collectively, “Saol”), a private specialty pharmaceutical company, pursuant to which it agreed to acquire Saol’s baclofen franchise, including Lioresal
®
, LYVISPAH™, and a pipeline product under development (the “Saol Acquisition”). The Saol Acquisition expanded the Company’s commercial institutional and specialty portfolio in neurology while adding commercial infrastructure in advance of its entry into the biosimilar institutional market. The transaction closed on February 9, 2022.
Consideration for the Saol Acquisition included $
84.7
 million, paid at closing with cash on hand, and contingent royalty payments based on annual net sales for certain acquired assets, beginning in June 2023. Cash paid at closing included $
1.1
 million for inventory acquired in excess of the normalized level, as defined in the asset purchase agreement (working capital adjustment).  
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company incurred $
0.1
 million in transaction costs associated with the Saol Acquisition, which was recorded in acquisition, transaction-related and integration expenses.
The Saol Acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, with Amneal as the accounting acquirer.

Revenue Recognition
Pharmaceutical Product Sales
Performance Obligations  
The Company’s performance obligation is the supply of finished pharmaceutical products to its customers. The Company’s customers consist primarily of major wholesalers, distributors, retail pharmacies, managed care organizations, purchasing co-ops, hospitals, government agencies, institutions and pharmaceutical companies. The Company’s customer contracts generally consist of both a master agreement, which is signed by the Company and its customer, and a customer submitted purchase order, which is governed by the terms and conditions of the master agreement. Customers purchase product by direct channel sales from the Company or by indirect channel sales through various distribution channels.
Revenue is recognized when the Company transfers control of its products to the customer, which typically occurs at a point-in-time, upon shipment or delivery. Substantially all of the Company’s net revenues relate to products which are transferred to the customer at a point-in-time.
The Company offers standard payment terms to its customers and has elected the practical expedient to not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing, since the period between when the Company transfers the product to the customer and when the customer pays for that product is one year or less. Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenues. The consideration amounts due from customers as a result of product sales are subject to variable consideration, as described further below.
The Company offers standard product warranties which provide assurance that the product will function as expected and in accordance with specifications. Customers cannot purchase warranties separately and these warranties do not give rise to a separate performance obligation.
The Company permits the return of product under certain circumstances, mainly upon product expiration, instances of shipping errors or where product is damaged in transit. The Company accrues for the customer’s right to return as part of its variable consideration. See below for further details.
Variable Consideration
The Company includes an estimate of variable consideration in its transaction price at the time of sale, when control of the product transfers to the customer. Variable consideration includes but is not limited to: chargebacks, distribution fees, rebates, group purchasing organization (“GPO”) fees, prompt payment (cash) discounts, consideration payable to the customer, billbacks, Medicaid and other government pricing programs, price protection and shelf stock adjustments, sales returns, and profit shares.
The Company assesses whether or not an estimate of its variable consideration is constrained and has determined that the constraint does not apply, since it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue will not occur in the future when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The Company’s estimates for variable consideration are adjusted as required at each reporting period for specific known developments that may result in a change in the amount of total consideration it expects to receive.
Chargebacks
In the case an indirect customer purchases product from their preferred wholesaler instead of directly from the Company, and the contract price charged to the indirect customer is lower than the wholesaler pricing, the Company pays the direct customer (wholesaler) a chargeback for the price differential. The Company estimates its chargeback accrual based on its estimates of the level of inventory of its products in the distribution channel that remain subject to chargebacks, current contract terms and historical experience. The estimate of the level of products in the distribution channel is based primarily on data provided by key customers.
F-20
Rebates
The Company pays fixed or volume-based rebates to its customers based on a fixed amount, fixed percentage of product sales or based on the achievement of a specified level of purchases. The Company’s rebate accruals are based on actual net sales, contractual rebate rates negotiated with customers, and expected purchase volumes / corresponding tiers based on actual sales to date and forecasted amounts.
Group Purchasing Organization Fees
The Company pays fees to GPOs for administrative services that the GPOs perform in connection with the purchases of product by the GPO participants who are the Company’s customers. The Company’s GPO fee accruals are based on actual net sales, contractual fee rates negotiated with GPOs and the mix of the products in the distribution channel that remain subject to GPO fees.
Prompt Payment (Cash) Discounts
The Company provides customers with prompt payment discounts which may result in adjustments to the price that is invoiced for the product transferred, in the case that payments are made within a defined period. The Company’s prompt payment discount accruals are based on actual net sales and contractual discount rates.
Consideration Payable to the Customer
The Company pays administrative and service fees to its customers based on a fixed percentage of the product price. These fees are not in exchange for a distinct good or service and therefore are recognized as a reduction of the transaction price. The Company accrues for these fees based on actual net sales, contractual fee rates negotiated with the customer and the mix of the products in the distribution channel that remain subject to fees.
Billbacks
In the case an indirect customer purchases product from their preferred wholesaler instead of directly from the Company, and the contract price charged to the indirect customer is higher than contractual pricing, the Company pays the indirect customer a billback for the price differential. The Company estimates its billback accrual based on its estimates of the level of inventory of its products in the distribution channel that remain subject to billbacks, current contract terms and historical experience. The estimate of the level of products in the distribution channel is based primarily on data provided by key customers.
Medicaid and Other Government Pricing Programs
The Company complies with required rebates mandated by law under Medicaid and other government pricing programs. The Company estimates its government pricing accruals based on monthly sales, historical experience of claims submitted by the various states and jurisdictions, historical rates and estimated lag time of the rebate invoices.
Price Protection and Shelf Stock Adjustments
The Company provides customers with price protection and shelf stock adjustments which may result in an adjustment to the price charged for the product transferred, based on differences between old and new prices which may be applied to the customer’s on-hand inventory at the time of the price change. The Company accrues for these adjustments when its expected value of an adjustment is greater than zero, based on contractual pricing, actual net sales, accrual rates based on historical average rates, and estimates of the level of inventory of its products in the distribution channel that remain subject to these adjustments. The estimate of the level of products in the distribution channel is based primarily on data provided by key customers.
Sales Returns
The Company permits the return of product under certain circumstances, mainly due to product expiration, instances of shipping errors or where product is damaged in transit, and occurrences of product recalls. The Company’s product returns accrual is primarily based on estimates of future product returns based generally on actual net sales, estimates of the level of inventory of its products in the distribution and retail channels that remain subject to returns, estimated lag time of returns and historical return rates. The estimate of the level of products in the distribution channel is based primarily on data provided by key customers.
F-21
Profit Shares
For certain product sale arrangements, the Company earns a profit share upon the customer’s sell-through of the product purchased from the Company. The Company estimates its profit shares based on actual net sales by third parties, estimated inventory sold to our partners not yet sold by them, and historical rates of profit shares earned. The estimate of the level of products in the distribution channel is based primarily on data provided by key customers.

Disaggregated Revenue
During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company changed the presentation of disaggregated net revenue in its Affordable Medicines segment from a classification primarily based on significant therapeutic classes to a classification primarily based on significant dosage forms to reflect the full product offering of the segment. The new presentation did not change the composition of the Company’s reportable segments and, therefore, did not change historical total net revenue in any segment.  All prior periods were changed to conform to the current period’s presentation.
The Company’s significant dosage forms for its Affordable Medicines segment, therapeutic classes for its Specialty segment and sales channels for its AvKARE segment, as determined based on net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, are set forth below (in thousands):

5. 
Alliance and Collaboration
The Company has entered into several alliance, collaboration, license, distribution and similar agreements with respect to certain of its products and services with third-party pharmaceutical companies. The consolidated statements of operations include revenue recognized under agreements the Company has entered into to develop marketing and/or distribution relationships with its partners to fully leverage the technology platform and revenue recognized under development agreements which generally obligate the Company to provide R&D services over multiple periods.
 The Company's significant arrangements are discussed below.
Orion Corporation License Agreement
On December 28, 2022, Amneal signed a long-term license agreement with Orion Corporation (“Orion”), a globally operating Finnish pharmaceutical company, to commercialize a number of our complex generic products in most parts of Europe, Australia and New Zealand (the “Orion Agreement”). The initial term of the Orion Agreement commences upon commercial launch of the products and will continue for 
eight years
. The Orion Agreement will automatically renew for successive 
two-year
 terms unless either party declines such renewal in writing at least one year in advance. 
Under the terms of the Orion Agreement, Amneal granted Orion licenses to certain generic products commercially available in the U.S. today and select high-value pipeline products currently under development. In addition, Amneal will be responsible for the performance of all R&D activities to be conducted to obtain regulatory approval for each product. Amneal is entitled to be reimbursed for a percentage of mutually agreed upon R&D expenses from Orion. Orion will be responsible for preparing and filing regulatory documentation, along with paying any application fees seeking regulatory approval for the products.
Upon achieving regulatory approval for products, Amneal will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying products to Orion. Orion will be responsible for all commercialization and marketing activities for the territories described above. Amneal will earn revenue for supplying products to Orion at the greater of: (i) cost plus a stated margin, or (ii) a fixed percentage of the net selling price, as defined in the Orion Agreement. 
Upon signing of the Orion Agreement, Amneal was entitled to an upfront, non-refundable payment of €
20.0
 million, or $
21.4
 million (based on the exchange rate at that date). Amneal is eligible to receive certain one-time sales-based milestones in the aggregate of €
45.0
 million, or $
46.7
 million (based on the exchange rate as of December 31, 2024) contingent upon whether Orion achieves certain annual sales targets.
The Orion Agreement is within the scope of ASC Topic 808, 
Collaborative Arrangements
 (“ASC 808”). The Company identified performance obligations related to: (1) the grant of a license of functional IP, (2) the performance of R&D activities, and (3) the supply of products. The Company evaluated that the grant of licenses is in the scope of ASC 606, whereas the performance of R&D activities is in the scope of ASC 730-20, 
Research and Development Arrangements
, because the Company determined that performing R&D activities on behalf of other parties is not part of the ordinary activities of its business. The Company will record reimbursement received from Orion for R&D activities as a reduction of R&D expense. The Company concluded each future purchase order from Orion represents a separate contract. Amneal will record revenue related to each purchase order when it transfers control of the products to Orion. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, Amneal recognized $
0.9
 million and $
0.5
 million, respectively, as a reduction of R&D expense for reimbursable R&D activities under the Orion Agreement. 
The Company determined that the transaction price under the arrangement was the upfront payment of $
21.4
 million, which was allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices. The remaining sales-based milestones payments of $
46.7
 million are variable consideration and were not included in the transaction price because they were fully constrained under ASC 606. 
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had recorded a $
21.4
 million receivable in prepaid expenses and other current assets for the upfront payment due from Orion, which was received in January 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $
8.0
 million in license revenue related to the delivery of functional IP, which was recorded in net revenues. The remaining $
13.4
 million of the transaction price was allocated to the R&D activities performance obligation and was recorded as deferred income, of which $
6.7
 million was recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses and $
6.7
 million was recorded in other long-term liabilities as of December 31, 2022.  
During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized $
0.9
 million as a reduction to R&D expense related to services performed under the Orion Agreement. As of December 31, 2023, deferred income of $
7.8
 million and $
4.7
 million was recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively. 
F-24
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $
4.0
 million as a reduction to R&D expense related to services performed under the Orion Agreement. As of December 31, 2024, deferred income of $
5.0
 million and $
3.5
 million was recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, no products have been supplied by Amneal under the Orion Agreement.

2.0
 million for payments received for a nonrefundable license fee and a regulatory milestone. 
The Knight License Agreement provides for potential future milestone payments totaling $
9.5
 million, contingent upon regulatory approval, launch dates and cumulative net sales targets by Knight. The agreement also includes low-double digit royalty payments based on net sales of IPX203.
License Agreement with Zambon Biotech
On February 23, 2024, the Company entered into a license, distribution and supply agreement with Zambon Biotech S.A. (“Zambon”) granting Zambon the exclusive rights to seek regulatory approval for and commercialize IPX203 in Europe (the “Zambon License Agreement”). The term for the Zambon License Agreement is 
15
 years commencing from the commercial launch of the product, which can automatically renew for successive 
two-year
 periods unless either party provides notice declining such renewal at least 
one year
 in advance. Zambon will be responsible for the performance of all R&D activities, regulatory approval, commercialization, and marketing activities for the territories in the agreement to be conducted to obtain regulatory approval for each product. Upon achieving regulatory approval for products, Amneal will be responsible for manufacturing and supplying products to Zambon.

Income Taxes
Amneal is a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal and most applicable state and local income tax purposes. As a partnership, Amneal is not subject to U.S. federal and certain state and local income taxes. Any taxable income or loss generated by Amneal is passed through to and included in the taxable income or loss of its members, including the Company, on a pro rata basis subject to applicable tax regulations. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes with respect to its allocable share of any taxable income or loss of Amneal, as well as any stand-alone income or loss generated by the Company. Amneal provides for income taxes in the various foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. Effective with the Reorganization on November 7, 2023, the Company and a wholly-owned subsidiary are the only members of Amneal.
The Company records its valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a DTA will not be realized. The Company routinely evaluates the realizability of its DTAs by assessing the likelihood that its DTAs will be recovered based on all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, estimates of future taxable income, tax planning strategies and results of operations. 
The Company established a valuation allowance based upon all available objective and verifiable evidence both positive and negative, including historical levels of pre-tax income (loss) both on a consolidated basis and tax reporting entity basis, legislative developments, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future pre-tax income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Since first establishing a valuation allowance, the Company has generated cumulative consolidated three-year pre-tax losses through December 31, 2024. As a result of the losses through December 31, 2024, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that it will not realize the benefits of its gross DTAs and therefore maintained its valuation allowance. As of December 31, 2024, this valuation allowance was $
590.3
 million
, 
and it reduced the carrying value of these gross DTAs, net of the impact of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, to zero. 
In 2018, the Company entered into a tax receivable agreement (“TRA”) with the Members pursuant to which it was generally required to pay the Members, on a 
one
-to-one basis, 
85
% of the applicable tax savings, if any, in U.S. federal and state income tax that it is deemed to realize as a result of certain tax attributes of their Amneal common units sold to the Company (or exchanged in a taxable sale) and that were created as a result of (i) the sales of their Amneal common units for shares of Class A common stock of the Company prior to the Reorganization (as defined in 
Note 1. Nature of Operations
) and (ii) tax benefits attributable to payments made under the TRA. As part of the Reorganization, the TRA was amended to reduce the Company’s future obligation to pay 
85
% of the tax benefits subject to the TRA to 
75
% of such realized benefits. The Reorganization’s amendment to the agreement will not cause the acceleration of TRA payments.
In conjunction with the valuation allowance recorded on the DTAs, the Company reversed the entire accrued TRA liability of $
192.8
 million during 2019. The Company did not record a TRA liability as of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 because future TRA payments were not probable and estimable. Payments made under the TRA represent amounts that otherwise would have been due to taxing authorities in the absence of attributes obtained by the Company as a result of the sales or exchanges of Amneal common units discussed above. Such amounts will be paid after cash tax savings are realized from the TRA attributes. Payments under the TRA are only expected to be made in periods following the filing of a tax return in which the Company is able to utilize certain tax benefits to reduce its cash taxes paid to a taxing authority.  
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded expenses associated with the TRA in total other expense, net of $
50.7
 million, $
3.1
 million, and $
0.6
 million, respectively, as a result of the realization of cash tax savings from the TRA attributes for those years. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had TRA liabilities of $
53.9
 million and $
3.7
 million, respectively (refer to 
Note 23. Related Party Transactions
 for the current and long-term portions of the TRA liability). The Company’s cumulative cash tax benefit recorded through December 31, 2024 associated with the TRA was approximately $
72.3
 million, of which the Company recognized cumulative expenses under the TRA of $
54.4
 million. 
As noted above, the Company has determined it is more-likely-than-not it will be unable to utilize its DTAs subject to the TRA; therefore, as of December 31, 2024, the Company had not recognized the contingent liability under the TRA related to the tax savings it may realize in future years from Amneal common units sold or exchanged. If utilization of these DTAs becomes more-likely-than-not in the future, at such time, the unrecorded contingent TRA liability (which amounted to $
133.8
 million as of December 31, 2024) will be recorded through charges in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. If the TRA 
F-27
attributes are not utilized in future years, it is reasonably possible no amounts would be paid under the TRA in excess of the $
53.9
 million accrued as of December 31, 2024.  
The timing and amount of any payments under the 
TRA may vary, depending upon a number of factors including the timing and amount of the Company’s taxable income, and the corporate tax rate in effect at the time of realization of the Company’s taxable income. The timing and amount of payments may also be accelerated under certain conditions, such as a change of control or other early termination event, which could give rise to the Company being obligated to make TRA payments in advance of tax benefits being realized. 
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 the Company's provision for income taxes and effective tax rates were $
18.9
 million and (
34.3
)%, $
8.5
 million and (
21.0
)%, and $
6.7
 million and (
2.7
)%, respectively. 
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal, and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. In the U.S., income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of 
three years
. The majority of states in which the Company files income tax returns follow the three-year U.S. federal statute of limitations, and a few states have a four-year statute of limitations in which to assess state taxes four years after the return is filed. Because the Company has unused state NOL carryovers generated more than three or four years ago, the relevant state taxing authorities may audit and adjust otherwise closed carryover tax years to the extent such NOL carryover is utilized in an open year. Neither the Company nor any of its other affiliates is currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. The Amneal partnership is currently under examination in certain states and the Company does not expect any material adjustments as of December 31, 2024.

The change in effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the timing and jurisdictional mix of income and the exit of the 
umbrella partnership-C-corporation structure as a result of the Reorganization (refer to 
Note 1. Nature of Operations
)
, which has the effect of allocating all of the operating company’s income to the corporate parent. 
The change in effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the timing and mix of income and the reversal of liabilities for uncertain tax positions in 2022.

At December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $
167.4
 million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards. These net operating loss carryforwards will partially expire, if unused, between 2029 and 2033. At December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $
19.0
 million of federal and $
147.3
 million of state net operating loss carry forwards. The federal net operating losses are generally allowed to be carried forward indefinitely, and the majority of the state net operating loss
es will expire, if unused, between 2032 and 2042.  At December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $
7.1
 million of federal R&D credit carry forwards and $
12.3
 million of state R&D credit carry forwards. The majority of the federal R&D credit carry forwards will expire if unused, between 2038 and 2044, and the majority of state credits will expire if unused by 2037. At 
December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $

The Company's Indian subsidiaries are primarily export-oriented, and the tax holiday benefits provided by the Indian government for export activities within Special Economic Zones (“SEZ”) expired in March 2023. Without availing the SEZ benefit in India, the Company is eligible to claim a reduced tax rate of approximately 
25.17
%.
The Company accounts for income tax contingencies using the benefit recognition model. The Company will recognize a benefit if a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits. The benefit is measured by determining the amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The amount of 
F-29
unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, was $
3.9
 million, $
3.7
 million and $
3.6
 million, respectively, of which $
3.9
 million, $
3.6
 million and $
3.5
 million, respectively, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate if recognized. The Company currently does not believe that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease significantly over the next 12 months. Interest expense related to income taxes is included in 
provision for income taxes
. Net interest expense (benefit) related to unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022 was $
0.8
 million and $(
0.7
) million, respectively (minimal for the year ended December 31, 2023). Accrued interest expense as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $
0.9
 million, $
0.1
 million, and $

In India, the income tax returns for the fiscal years ending March 31, 2022 and 2023 are currently being reviewed by tax authorities as part of the normal procedures, and the Company is not expecting any material adjustments. There are no other income tax returns in the process of examination, administrative appeal, or litigation. Income tax returns are generally subject to examination for a period of 
three years
, 
five years
, and 
four years
 after the tax year in India, Switzerland,
 a
nd Ireland, respectively.
Applicable foreign taxes (including withholding taxes) have not been provided on the approximately $
137.8
 million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024. These earnings have been and currently are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Quantification of additional taxes that may be payable on distribution is not practicable.
The Company continuously monitors government proposals to make changes to tax laws, including comprehensive tax reform in the U.S. and proposed legislation in certain foreign jurisdictions resulting from the adoption of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) policies. If legislative changes are enacted in other countries, any of these proposals may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. A change in statutory tax rates in any country would result in the revaluation of Amneal’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. 
As a U.S. company with subsidiaries in, among other countries, India, Switzerland, Ireland and the U.K, we carefully evaluate how many of these many countries are implementing legislation and other guidance to align their international tax rules with the OECD Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations and action plan that aim to standardize and modernize global corporate tax policy, including changes to cross-border tax, transfer pricing documentation rules, and nexus-based tax incentive practices. The OECD has issued a two-pillar approach to global taxation, focusing on global profit allocation and a global minimum tax rate. The “Pillar One” global profit allocation proposal would not apply to the Company, since it generally applies to companies with global revenues exceeding €20 billion (approximately $21 billion using the exchange rate as of December 31, 2024). The “Pillar Two” proposal focuses on a global minimum tax of at least 15%. Legislation for the “Pillar Two” proposal, applying to the Company, has been enacted in Ireland, and became effective with the financial year beginning on January 1, 2024. As the tax rates of the other jurisdictions in which the Company operates exceed 15%, the Company does not believe there is any potential additional exposure besides in Ireland.  
The Company assessed that no top-up tax under Pillar 2 of the OECD Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting is expected to be due for the year ended December 31, 2024. This assessment is based on the application of safe harbor provisions available in all relevant jurisdictions including UK, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, U.S. and India.
Since Pillar Two taxes are an alternative minimum tax, deferred taxes will not need to be recorded or remeasured. Instead, Pillar Two taxes will be expensed as incurred.

Loss per Share
Following the implementation of the Reorganization on November 7, 2023 (refer to 
Note 1. Nature of Operations
 for additional information), all outstanding shares of Old PubCo Class A Common Stock and Old PubCo Class B Common Stock were exchanged for an equivalent number of shares of Class A common stock of the Company. 
Basic loss per share of Class A common stock was computed by dividing net loss attributable to Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share of Class A common stock was computed by dividing net loss attributable to Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period, adjusted to give effect to potentially dilutive securities. The weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock for all periods prior to the Reorganization includes shares of Old PubCo Class A Common Stock.  
The following table sets forth reconciliations of the numerators and denominators used to compute basic and diluted loss per share of Class A common stock (in thousands, except per share amounts):

Prior to the Reorganization, shares of Old PubCo Class B Common Stock did not share in the earnings or losses of the Company and, therefore, were not participating securities. As such, separate presentation of basic and diluted loss per share of Old PubCo Class B Common Stock under the two-class method was not presented. Effective with the Reorganization,  all outstanding shares of Old PubCo Class B Common Stock were surrendered and canceled.

Annual Goodwill Impairment Test
The Company performed a quantitative annual goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit on October 1, 2024, the measurement date. The analysis performed included estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches. Based on the results of the annual impairment test, the Company determined that the estimated fair values of the Affordable Medicines, Specialty and AvKARE reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts as of the measurement date; therefore, the Company did 
no
t record an impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2024. There were no indicators of goodwill impairment during the year ended December 31, 2024, including the period subsequent to the measurement date.
In performing the quantitative annual goodwill impairment test, the Company utilized long-term growth rates for its reporting units ranging from 
no
 growth to 
1.0
% and a discount rate ranging from 
10.5
% to 
14.0
% in its estimation of fair value. As of October 1, 2024, the estimated fair value of the Affordable Medicines reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value by approximately 
112
%, the estimated fair value of the Specialty reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value by approximately 
113
%, and the estimated fair value of the AvKARE reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value by approximately 
728
%. A

-basis point increase in the assumed discount rates utilized in each test would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge in any of the Company's reporting units. 
While management believes the assumptions used were reasonable and commensurate with the views of a market participant, changes in key assumptions for these reporting units, including increasing the discount rate, lowering forecasts for revenue and operating margin or lowering the long-term growth rate, could result in a future goodwill impairment.

Overview of Amneal Credit Facilities
On May 4, 2018 the Company entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”) that provided a term loan (“Term Loan Due 2025”) with a principal amount of $
2.7
 billion and an asset backed revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”) under which loans and letters of credit up to a principal amount of $
500.0
 million were available (principal amount of up to $
25.0
 million was available for letters of credit). 
On June 2, 2022, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the “New Credit Agreement”) that terminated the lender commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, and replaced them with a new $
350.0
 million senior secured 
F-35
revolving credit facility that matures on June 2, 2027 (the “New Revolving Credit Facility”). In addition, the New Credit Agreement (i) provided for up to $
25.0
 million for the purpose of issuing letters of credit, (ii) provided for up to $
35.0
 million for the purpose of issuing swingline loans, and (iii) allowed the Company to request an incremental increase in the revolving facility commitments by up to $
150.0
 million. 
On November 14, 2023, the Company and certain existing consenting lenders under the Term Loan Credit Agreement entered into an amendment to the Term Loan Due 2025 (the “New Term Loan Credit Agreement”). As a result of this transaction (the “Refinancing”), the Company exchanged and refinanced $
2.35
 billion of the $
2.54
 billion of principal then outstanding under the Term Loan Due 2025, at par, for new term loans that mature on May 4, 2028 (the “Term Loan Due 2028”). After the Refinancing, the principal remaining on the Term Loan Due 2025 was $
192.0
 million. 
In October 2019, the Company entered into an interest rate lock agreement for a total notional amount of $
1.3
 billion to hedge part of the Company’s interest rate exposure associated with the variability in future cash flows with its Term Loan Due 2025. In connection with the Refinancing, the Company amended this interest rate agreement. For further details on this, refer to 
Note 19. Financial Instruments. 
Additionally on November 14, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the New Revolving Credit Facility (the “Amended New Revolving Credit Facility”), pursuant to which certain lenders agreed to increase their commitments such that the aggregate revolving commitments increased to up to $
600.0
 million.
The Term Loan Due 2028, Term Loan Due 2025, Amended New Revolving Credit Facility, New Revolving Credit Facility and Revolving Credit Facility are collectively referred to as the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”. The proceeds of any loans made under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities can be used for capital expenditures, acquisitions, working capital needs and other general purposes, subject to covenants as described below.
Amneal Term Loans
Term Loan Due 2025
The Term Loan Due 2025 required principal repayments in equal quarterly installments at a rate of 
1.00
% of the original principal amount annually, with the balance payable at maturity on May 4, 2025. Subject to the refinancing on November 14, 2023, the Company is no longer required to repay quarterly principal installments, and as a result, the Company was required to repay the remaining principal balance of $
192.0
 million at maturity on May 4, 2025. In January 2025, the Company paid the entire remaining principal balance of $
192.0
 million outstanding on its Term Loan Due 2025, plus accrued interest thereon of $
0.7
 million, with $
190.0
 million of new borrowings under the Amended New Revolving Credit Facility and cash on hand.  
Prior to May 31, 2023, the variable annual interest rate of the Term Loan Due 2025 was a LIBOR-designated rate plus 
3.5
%. On May 31, 2023, the Company executed an amendment to the Term Loan Due 2025, which changed the variable reference rate from LIBOR to the one-month adjusted term secured overnight financing rate (“SOFR”), subject to a floor of (
0.11448
%) plus 
3.5
%. After adopting ASC 848, 
Reference Rate Reform
 and electing certain applicable practical expedients, this amendment did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, the interest rate for borrowings under the Term Loan Due 2025 was approximately 
8.0
%.
The Term Loan Due 2025 was recorded in the balance sheet net of issuance costs. In 2018, the Company incurred costs associated with the Term Loan Due 2025 of $
38.1
 million, which were capitalized and amortized over the life of the Term Loan Due 2025 to interest expense using the effective interest method. Subject to the amendment to the Term Loan Due 2025, unamortized debt issuance costs of $
0.6
 million and $
7.3
 million were allocated on a pro rata basis to the Term Loan Due 2025 and Term Loan Due 2028, respectively. The remaining unamortized debt issuance costs will be amortized over the life of the Term Loan Due 2025 to interest expense using the effective interest method. Amortization of debt issuance costs related to the Term Loan Due 2025 was 
no
t material for the year ended December 31, 2024. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, amortization of debt issuance costs related to the Term Loan Due 2025 were $
4.7
 million and $
5.4
 million, respectively.
Refinancing and Term Loan Due 2028
The Term Loan Due 2028 is repayable in equal quarterly installments in an amount equal to 
2.50
% per annum of the original principal amount thereof, with the remaining balance due at final maturity on May 4, 2028. Interest is payable on borrowings under the Term Loan Due 2028 at a rate equal to the term SOFR benchmark rate or the base rate, plus an applicable margin, in each case, subject to a term SOFR benchmark rate floor of 
0.00
% or a base rate floor of 
1.00
%, as applicable. The applicable margin for borrowings under the Term Loan Due 2028 is 
5.50
% per annum for term SOFR benchmark rate loans and 
4.50
% per 
F-36
annum for base rate loans. As of December 31, 2024, the interest rate for borrowings under the Term Loan Due 2028 was approximately 
9.9
%.
The Refinancing involved multiple lenders that were considered members of a loan syndicate. In determining whether the refinancing of the Term Loan Due 2025 was to be accounted for as a debt extinguishment or a debt modification, the Company considered whether creditors remained the same or changed and whether the changes in debt terms were substantial, on a lender-by-lender basis, in accordance with the guidance in ASC 470, 
Debt
. As a result of this analysis, the Company legally has separate loans from each lender in the syndicate of the Term Loan Due 2028 and each lender has a contractual right to payments from the Company. The Company concluded that, on a lender-by-lender basis, debt held by 
99
% of the lenders included in the Refinancing is considered modified, with the remaining debt held by lenders considered to be extinguished. In accordance with ASC 470, 
Debt
, the Company capitalized costs of $
118.6
 million associated with the Term Loan Due 2028, primarily comprised of lender fees, which were combined with $
7.3
 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Term Loan Due 2025 (as discussed above), both to be amortized to interest expense over the life of the Term Loan Due 2028 using the effective interest method. In connection with the Refinancing, the Company recognized a loss of $
40.8
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was primarily comprised of debt issuance costs associated with the portion of the Term Loan Due 2025 that was modified. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, amortization of debt issuance costs related to the Term Loan Due 2028 was $
24.3
 million and $
2.9
 million, respectively.
The borrowings under the Term Loan Due 2028 are guaranteed by certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company that also guarantee the Term Loan Due 2025 (together with the Company, the “Loan Parties”).
The Loan Parties’ obligations under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement are secured, subject to customary permitted liens and other agreed upon exceptions, by a perfected security interest in (i) all tangible and intangible assets of the Loan Parties, except for certain excluded assets, and (ii) all of the equity interests of the subsidiaries of the Loan Parties (except for certain excluded subsidiaries and excluded assets and limited, in the case of the voting equity interests of certain foreign subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries that hold no assets other than equity interests of foreign subsidiaries, to 
65
% of the voting equity interests of such subsidiaries).
New Credit Agreement, New Revolving Credit Facility and Amended New Credit Facility
The New Revolving Credit Facility bears an interest rate equal to the alternate base rate (“ABR”) or SOFR, plus an applicable margin, in each case, subject to an ABR floor of 
1.00
% or a SOFR floor of 
0.00
%, as applicable. The applicable margin for the New Revolving Credit Facility was initially 
0.25
% per annum for ABR loans and 
1.25
% per annum for SOFR loans. The applicable margin on borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility thereafter adjusts, ranging from 
0.25
% to 
0.50
% per annum for ABR loans and from 
1.25
% to 
1.50
% per annum for SOFR loans determined by the average historical excess availability. The Company paid a commitment fee based on the average daily unused amount of the New Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 
0.25
% per annum. 
The Amended New Revolving Credit Facility bears interest rate consistent with the New Revolving Credit Facility. The maturity date of the Amended New Revolving Credit Facility is June 2, 2027, subject to a springing maturity in certain circumstances set forth in the Amended New Revolving Credit Facility. 
The Company incurred costs associated with the Revolving Credit Facility of $
4.6
 million, which were capitalized and are being amortized over the life of the agreement. Subject to the June 2, 2022 refinancing, there was a decrease in the borrowing capacity of certain lenders between the New Revolving Credit Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility. As a result, the Company recorded a $
0.3
 million charge for the year ended December 31, 2022 in loss on refinancing. Additionally, the Company incurred costs of $
1.6
 million associated with the New Credit Agreement, which were capitalized as deferred financing costs with the remaining unamortized costs associated with the Revolving Credit Facility, and were amortized over the life of the New Credit Agreement. 
Subject to the November 14, 2023 amendment, there was an increase in the borrowing capacity of all lenders between the Amended New Revolving Credit Facility and the New Revolving Credit Facility. The Company incurred costs of $
2.4
 million associated with the Amended New Revolving Credit Facility, which were capitalized as deferred financing costs with the remaining unamortized costs associated with the New Revolving Credit Facility, and will be amortized over the life of the Amended New Credit Agreement. 
Costs associated with the Amended New Revolving Credit Facility and the New Revolving Credit Facility have been recorded in other assets. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, amortization of deferred financing costs were $
1.1
 million, $
0.5
 million and $
0.7
 million, respectively.
F-37
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company borrowed $
20.0
 million and repaid $
99.0
 million under the Amended New Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
100.0
 million in borrowings and $
495.2
 million of available capacity under the Amended New Revolving Credit Facility (principal amount of up to $
20.2
 million remained available for letters of credit).   As discussed above, in January 2025, the Company paid the entire remaining principal balance of $
192.0
 million outstanding on its Term Loan Due 2025, plus accrued interest thereon of $
0.7
 million, with $
190.0
 million of new borrowings under the Amended New Revolving Credit Facility and cash on hand. 
As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $
179.0
 million in borrowings and $
225.2
 million of available capacity under the Amended New Revolving Credit Facility 
(principal amount of up to $
20.9
 million remained available for letters of credit)
. 
Covenants to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities
The Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a number of covenants that, among other things, create liens on Amneal’s and its subsidiaries’ assets. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain certain negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, restrict Amneal’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt or guarantees, grant liens, make loans, acquisitions or other investments, dispose of assets, merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate, pay dividends or other payments on capital stock, make optional payments or modify certain debt instruments, modify certain organizational documents, enter into arrangements that restrict the ability to pay dividends or grant liens, or enter into or consummate transactions with affiliates. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain customary events of default, subject to certain exceptions. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, the obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities may be accelerated and the commitments may be terminated. In addition, the Amended New Revolving Credit Facility also included a financial covenant whereby the Company was required to maintain a minimum fixed-charge coverage ratio if certain borrowing conditions were met. At December 31, 2024, Amneal was in compliance with all covenants associated with the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.
Annually, the Company is also required to calculate the amount of excess cash flows, as defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement and New Term Loan Credit Agreement. Based on the results of the excess cash flows calculation for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, no additional principal payments were due.
Rondo Credit Facilities and Note Payable - Related Party
Rondo Acquisitions Financing - Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement
On January 31, 2020, in connection with the Rondo Acquisitions, Rondo Intermediate Holdings, LLC (“Rondo Holdings”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rondo Holdings, LLC, entered into a revolving credit and term loan agreement (“Rondo Credit Facility”) that provided a term loan (“Rondo Term Loan”) with a principal amount of $
180.0
 million and a revolving credit facility (“Rondo Revolving Credit Facility”), which loaned up to a principal amount of $
30.0
 million.  During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company paid the remaining outstanding principal under the Rondo Term Loan from cash on hand
. 
The Rondo Credit Facility bore a variable annual interest rate, which originated as one-month LIBOR plus 
3.0
%. 
On April 30, 2023, the Company executed an amendment to the Rondo Revolving Credit Facility, which changed the variable reference rate in the Rondo Term Loan from LIBOR to the one-month adjusted term SOFR, subject to a floor of 
0.1
% plus 
2.25
%. This amendment to the Rondo Revolving Credit Facility did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. On September 21, 2023, the Company executed an amendment to the Rondo Revolving Credit Facility (the “Amended Rondo Revolving Credit Facility”) that, among other things, (i) increased the aggregate revolving commitment from $
30.0
 million to $
70.0
 million, and (ii) increased the letter of credit commitment from $
10.0
 million to $
60.0
 million. The Amended Rondo Revolving Credit Facility bears a variable annual interest rate, which did not change as a result of this amendment, of one-month adjusted term SOFR, subject to a floor of 
0.1
% plus 
2.25
%. On December 16, 2024, the Company executed an amendment to the Amended Rondo Revolving Credit Facility to extend the maturity from January 31, 2025 to April 30, 2025. No other material changes were made to the terms of the Revolving Credit facility. At December 31, 2024, the variable annual interest rate was one-month SOFR plus 
2.5
%. Additionally, the annual interest rate for borrowings under the Amended Rondo Revolving Credit Facility may be reduced or increased by 
0.25
% based on step-downs and step-ups determined by the total net leverage ratio, as defined in that agreement. 
A commitment fee based on the average daily unused amount of the Amended Rondo Revolving Credit Facility is assessed at a rate based on total net leverage ratio, between 
0.25
% and 
0.50
% per annum. At December 31, 2024, the Amended Rondo Revolving Credit Facility commitment fee rate was 
0.25
% per annum.
F-38
Costs associated with the Amended Rondo Revolving Credit Facility of $
0.6
 million were capitalized and amortized over the life of the facility to interest expense using the effective interest method. Costs associated with the Amended Rondo Revolving Credit Facility were recorded in other assets. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, amortization of deferred financing costs associated with the Amended Rondo Revolving Credit Facility were $
0.6
 million and $
0.2
 million, respectively.
The Amended Rondo Revolving Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, create liens on the equity securities and assets of Rondo Holdings, Rondo, AvKARE, LLC and Dixon-Shane, LLC d/b/a R&S Northeast LLC (“R&S”). The Amended Rondo Revolving Credit Facility contains certain negative, affirmative and financial covenants that, among other things, restrict the ability to incur additional debt, grant liens, transact in mergers and acquisitions, make certain investments and payments or engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Amended Rondo Revolving Credit Facility also contains customary events of default. Upon the occurrence of certain events of default, the obligations under the Amended Rondo Revolving Credit Facility may be accelerated and/or the interest rate may be increased. At December 31, 2024, Rondo was in compliance with all covenants. The Company is not party to the Amended Rondo Revolving Credit Facility and is not a guarantor of any debt incurred thereunder.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company borrowed $
28.0
 million under the Amended Rondo Revolving Credit Facility for working capital purposes. The Company repaid $
28.0
 million of these borrowings during the year ended December 31, 2024 from cash on hand. 
On September 26, 2023, Rondo entered into a standby letter of credit guarantee arrangement under the Amended Rondo Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of $
42.0
 million for purposes of securing inventory from a certain supplier. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company had 
no
 outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit of $
42.0
 million under the Amended Rondo Revolving Credit Facility and unused borrowing capacity of $
28.0

Rondo Acquisitions Financing – Notes Payable-Related Party
On January 31, 2020, the closing date of the Rondo Acquisitions, Rondo Partners, LLC or its subsidiary, Rondo Top Holdings, LLC, issued notes to the sellers (the “Sellers Notes”) with a stated aggregate principal amount of $
44.2
 million and a short-term note to a seller (the “Short-Term Seller Note”) with a stated principal amount of $
1.0
 million. The Sellers Notes were unsecured and accrued interest at a rate of 
5
% per annum, not compounded, until June 30, 2025. The Sellers Notes were subject to prepayment at the option of Rondo, as the obligor, without premium or penalty. Mandatory payment of the outstanding principal and interest was due on June 30, 2025 if certain financial targets were achieved, the borrowers’ cash flows were sufficient (as defined in the Sellers Notes) and repayment was not prohibited by senior debt. If repayment of all outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Sellers Notes was not made on June 30, 2025, the requirements for repayment were to be revisited on June 30 of each subsequent year until all principal and accrued interest were satisfied no later than January 31, 2030 or earlier, upon a change in control, as defined. The Short-Term Sellers Note was also unsecured, accrued interest at a rate of 
1.6
%, and was paid during February 2021.
In accordance with ASC 805, 
Business Combinations
, all consideration transferred was measured at its acquisition-date fair value. The Sellers Notes were stated at the fair value estimate of $
35.0
 million, which was estimated using the Monte-Carlo simulation approach under the option pricing framework. The Short-Term Sellers Note of $
1.0
 million was recorded at the stated principal amount of $
1.0
 million, which approximated fair value. The $
9.2
 million discount on the Sellers Notes was to be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method from January 31, 2020 to June 30, 2025 and the carrying value of the Sellers Notes was to accrete to the stated principal amount of $
44.2
 million. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company repaid principal of $
44.2
 million and interest of $
10.0
 million associated with the Sellers Notes from cash on hand. As of December 31, 2024, the Sellers Notes and accrued interest had been fully repaid. The Sellers Notes, net of unamortized discount, were included in notes payable-related party and accrued interest was included in related party payables-short term and long-term as of December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, amortization of the discount related to the Sellers Notes was $
1.1

Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value should maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. To measure fair value, the Company uses the following fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable:
Level 1 
–
Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 –
Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.

Level 3 
–
Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques and also includes instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation.
F-42
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The Company evaluates its financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring basis to determine the appropriate level of classification for each reporting period.

(1)
The fair value measurement of the Company’s interest rate swap classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy is a model-derived valuation as of a given date in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets including certain financial information and certain assumptions regarding past, present, and future market conditions. Refer to 
Note 19. Financial Instruments
 for information about the Company’s interest rate swap.
(2)
These liabilities are recorded at the value of the amount owed to the plan participants, with changes in value recognized as compensation expense. The calculation of the deferred compensation plan obligation is derived from observable market data by reference to hypothetical investments selected by the participants.
(3)
The fair value measurement of contingent consideration liability has been classified as a Level 3 recurring liability as its valuation requires judgment and estimation of factors that are not currently observable in the market. If different assumptions were used for various inputs, the estimated fair value could be higher or lower than what the Company determined. As of December 31, 2023, the contingent consideration liability associated with the Saol Acquisition included $
0.1
 million recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses and $
0.4
 million recorded in other-longer term liabilities. As of December 31, 2023, the contingent consideration liability associated with the acquisition of Kashiv Specialty Pharmaceuticals, LLC was $
0.4
 million and was recorded within related party payables - long term.
  Contingent consideration liability was $
0
 as of December 31, 2024.
 There were no transfers between levels in the fair value hierarchy during the year ended
 December 31, 2024.
Contingent Consideration
On February 9, 2022, the Company completed the Saol Acquisition (refer to 
Note 3. Acquisition
), which provides for contingent royalty payments that are tiered depending on the aggregate annual net sales for certain pharmaceutical products, beginning in 2023.  
F-43
Contingent royalty payments for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were not material.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the contingent consideration liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the year ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands):

The fair value measurement of the contingent consideration liabilities was determined based on significant unobservable inputs, including the discount rate, estimated probabilities of success, timing of achieving specified regulatory milestones and the estimated amount of future sales of the acquired products. The contingent consideration liability is estimated by applying a probability-weighted expected payment model for contingent milestone payments and a Monte Carlo simulation model for contingent royalty payments, which are then discounted to present value. Changes to fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities can result from changes to one or a number of the aforementioned inputs. If different assumptions were used for various inputs, the estimated fair value could be higher or lower than what the Company determined. The change in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability for the year ended December 31, 2024 and the contingent consideration liability as of December 31, 2024 was not material.

19. 
Financial Instruments
The Company uses an interest rate swap to manage its exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents may fluctuate as interest rates change; however, due to their relatively short maturities, the Company does not hedge these assets or their investment cash flows and the impact of interest rate risk is not material. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its debt obligations. The Company's debt obligations consist of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt instruments (for further details, refer to 
Note 15. Debt
). The Company's primary objective is to achieve the lowest overall cost of funding while managing the variability in cash outflows within an acceptable range. To achieve this objective, the Company initially entered into an interest rate swap on the Term Loan Due 2025. On November 14, 2023, in connection with the refinancing of the Term Loan Due 2025 and the New Credit Facility, the Company novated its swap agreement to another counterparty and, in connection with such novation, amended the interest rate swap agreement. Refer to section “
Interest Rate Derivative - Cash Flow Hedge
” below for additional information.
Interest Rate Derivative – Cash Flow Hedge
The interest rate swap involves the periodic exchange of payments without the exchange of underlying principal or notional amounts. In October 2019, the Company entered into an interest rate lock agreement for a total notional amount of $
1.3
 billion to hedge part of the Company's interest rate exposure associated with the variability in future cash flows from changes in the one-month LIBOR associated with its Term Loan Due 2025 (the “October 2019 Swap”). On May 31, 2023, the Company executed an amendment to the October 2019 Swap that, among other things, changed the variable reference rate from LIBOR to the one-month SOFR (the “Amended October 2019 Swap”). 
On November 14, 2023, in connection with the Company’s refinancing of the Term Loan Due 2025 and the New Credit Facility (refer to Note 15. 
Debt
), the Company novated its Amended October 2019 Swap to another counterparty and subsequently amended the interest rate agreement. Specifically, the amendments modified (i) the fixed rate payable by the counterparty from 
1.3660
% to a new fixed rate of 
2.7877
% and (ii) extended the termination date through May 4, 2027 (i.e., one year before the Term Loan Due 2028 matures) (the “November 2023 Swap”). The amendments did not change the notional amount of $
1.3
 billion. The purpose of the November 2023 Swap is to hedge part of the Company's interest rate exposure associated with the variability in future cash flows from changes in the one-month SOFR associated with the Term Loan Due 2028. 
The Company used a strategy commonly referred to as “blend and extend,” which allows the existing asset position of the swap agreement to be effectively blended into the new interest rate swap agreement. As a result of this transaction, on November 14, 2023, the Amended October 2019 Swap was de-designated and the unrealized gain of $
66.7
 million was recorded within accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be amortized as a reduction of interest expense, net, over the original term of the of the Amended October 2019 Swap (until May 2025), as the hedged transactions affect earnings. Additionally, the November 2023 Swap had a fair value of $
66.7
 million at inception, and will be ratably recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to interest expense, net, over the term of the November 2023 Swap (until May 2027), as the hedged transactions affect earnings.
At the inception of the November 2023 Swap, the Company determined that the swap qualified for cash flow hedge accounting under ASC 815. Therefore, changes in the fair value of the swap, net of taxes, will be recognized in other comprehensive loss each period, then reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations as a component of interest expense, net in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The November 2023 Swap is the only swap agreement outstanding as of December 31, 2024.
The effectiveness of the outstanding November 2023 Swap will be assessed qualitatively by the Company during the life of the hedge by (i) comparing the current terms of the hedge with the related hedged debt to assure they continue to coincide based upon initial quantitative assessment of the amended swap and (ii) through an evaluation of the ability of the counterparty to the hedge to honor its obligations under the hedge.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company reclassified a net gain of $
26.2
 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss to a reduction of interest expense, net. Approximately $
3.8
 million of net losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of December 31, 2024 are expected to be reclassified into earnings as interest expense within the next 12 months as interest payments are made on the Company’s Term Loan Due 2028 and amortization of the amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss occurs.
F-45
As of 
December 31, 2024

the total gain, net of income taxes, related to the Company’s cash flow hedge of $

Commitments and Contingencies
Commitments
Commercial Manufacturing, Collaboration, License, and Distribution Agreements
The Company continues to seek to enhance its product line and develop a balanced portfolio of differentiated products through product acquisitions and in-licensing. Accordingly, the Company, in certain instances, may be contractually obligated to make potential future development, regulatory, and commercial milestone, royalty and/or profit-sharing payments in conjunction with collaborative agreements or acquisitions that the Company has entered with third parties. The Company has also licensed certain technologies or IP from various third parties. The Company is generally required to make upfront payments and other payments upon successful completion of regulatory or sales milestones. The agreements generally permit the Company to terminate the agreement with no significant continuing obligation. The Company could be required to make significant payments pursuant to these arrangements. These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events and, given the nature of these events, it is unclear when, if ever, the Company may be required to pay such amounts. Further, the timing of any future payment is not reasonably estimable. Refer to 
Note 5. Alliance and Collaboration 
for additional information.

Certain of these arrangements are with related parties. Refer to 
Note 23. Related Party Transactions 
for additional information

Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company's legal proceedings are complex, constantly evolving, and subject to uncertainty. As such, the Company cannot predict the outcome or impact of its significant legal proceedings which are set forth below. Additionally, the Company manufactures and derives a portion of its revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical products in the opioid class of drugs and may therefore face claims arising from the regulation and/or consumption of such products. While the Company believes it has meritorious claims and/or defenses to the matters described below (and intends to vigorously prosecute and defend them), the nature and cost of litigation is unpredictable, and an unfavorable outcome of such proceedings could include damages, fines, penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies. 
For any proceedings where losses are probable and reasonably capable of estimation, the Company accrues a potential loss. When the Company has a probable loss for which a reasonable estimate of the liability is a range of losses and no amount within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, the Company records the loss at the low end of the range. While these accruals have been deemed reasonable by the Company’s management, the assessment process relies heavily on estimates and assumptions that may ultimately prove inaccurate or incomplete. Additionally, unforeseen circumstances or events may lead the Company to subsequently change its estimates and assumptions. Unless otherwise indicated below, the Company is unable at this time to estimate the possible loss or the range of loss, if any, associated with such legal proceedings and claims. Any
 such claims, proceedings, investigations or litigation, regardless of the merits, might result in substantial costs to defend or settle, borrowings under the Company’s debt agreements, restrictions on product use or sales, or otherwise harm the Company’s business. The ultimate resolution of any or all claims, legal proceedings or investigations are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict, could differ materially from the Company’s estimates and could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and/or cash flows in any given accounting period, or on its overall financial condition. The Company currently intends to vigorously prosecute and/or defend these proceedings as appropriate. From time to time, how
ever, the Company may settle or otherwise resolve these matters on terms and conditions that it believes to be in its best interest. An insurance recovery, if any, is recorded in the period in which it is probable the recovery will be realized.

Refer to the respective discussions below for information about the significant matters summarized above.
Medicaid Reimbursement and Price Reporting Matters
The Company is required to provide pricing information to state agencies, including agencies that administer federal Medicaid programs. Certain state agencies have alleged that manufacturers have reported improper pricing information, which allegedly caused them to overpay reimbursement costs. Other agencies have alleged that manufacturers have failed to timely file required reports concerning pricing information. Liabilities are periodically established by the Company for any potential claims or settlements of overpayment. The Company intends to vigorously defend against any such claims. The ultimate settlement of any potential liability for such claims may be higher or lower than estimated.
Patent Litigation
There is substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical, biological, and biotechnology industries with respect to the manufacture, use, and sale of new products which are the subject of conflicting patent and IP claims. One or more patents often cover the brand name products for which the Company is developing generic versions, and the Company typically has patent rights covering the Company’s branded products.
Under federal law, when a drug developer files an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) for a generic drug seeking approval before expiration of a patent which has been listed with the FDA as covering the brand name product, the developer must certify its product will not infringe the listed patent(s) and/or the listed patent is invalid or unenforceable (commonly referred to as a “Paragraph IV” certification). Notices of such certification must be provided to the patent holder, who may file a suit for patent infringement within 45 days of the patent holder’s receipt of such notice. If the patent holder files suit within the 45-day period, the FDA can review and tentatively approve the ANDA, but generally is prevented from granting final marketing approval of the product until a final judgment in the action has been rendered in favor of the generic drug developer, or 30 months from the date the notice was received, whichever is sooner. The Company’s Affordable Medicines segment is typically subject to patent infringement litigation brought by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers in connection with the Company’s Paragraph IV certifications seeking an order delaying the approval of the Company’s ANDA until expiration of the patent(s) at issue in the litigation.
The uncertainties inherent in patent litigation make the outcome of such litigation difficult to predict. For the Company’s Affordable Medicines segment, the potential consequences in the event of an unfavorable outcome in such litigation include 
F-47
delaying launch of its generic products until patent expiration. If the Company were to launch its generic product prior to successful resolution of a patent litigation, the Company could be liable for potential damages measured by the profits lost by the branded product manufacturer rather than the profits earned by the Company if it is found to infringe a valid, enforceable patent, or enhanced treble damages in cases of willful infringement. For the Company’s Specialty segment, an unfavorable outcome may significantly accelerate generic competition ahead of expiration of the patents covering the Company’s branded products. All such litigation typically involves significant expense.
The Company is generally responsible for all of the patent litigation fees and costs associated with current and future products not covered by its alliance and collaboration agreements. The Company has agreed to share legal expenses with respect to third-party and Company products under the terms of certain of the alliance and collaboration agreements. The Company records the costs of patent litigation as expense in the period when incurred for products it has developed, as well as for products which are the subject of an alliance or collaboration agreement with a third party.
Other Litigation Related to the Company’s Business

Opana ER
®
 Antitrust Litigation
From June 2014 to April 2015, a number of complaints styled as class actions on behalf of direct purchasers and indirect purchasers (or end-payors) and several separate individual complaints on behalf of certain direct purchasers (the “opt-out plaintiffs”) of Opana ER
®
 were filed against Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Impax Laboratories, Inc. (“Impax”) and consolidated into multi-district litigation (“MDL”) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.
Impax subsequently entered into settlement agreements with all of the plaintiffs that were subsequently approved by the court. Pursuant to the settlement agreements, the Company agreed to pay a total of $
265.0
 million between 2022 and mid-January 2024 to resolve substantially all of the plaintiffs’ claims. As of December 31, 2023, the liability for the final settlement payment of $
50.0
 million, plus 
3
% stated interest thereon, was included in the current portion of liabilities for legal matters and was paid in January 2024 with cash on hand. The settlement agreements are not an admission of liability or fault by Impax, the Company or its subsidiaries. Upon court approval of the final settlement agreements as discussed above, substantially all the claims and lawsuits in the litigation were resolved. 
United States Department of Justice Investigations

In Re Generic Pharmaceuticals Pricing Antitrust Litigation
Beginning in March 2016, various purchasers of generic drugs filed multiple putative antitrust class action complaints against a substantial number of generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, including the Company and Impax, alleging an illegal conspiracy to fix, maintain, stabilize, and/or raise prices, rig bids, and allocate markets or customers. They seek unspecified monetary damages and equitable relief, including disgorgement and restitution. The lawsuits were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (See 
In re Generic Pharmaceuticals Pricing Antitrust Litigation, 
No. 2724 (E.D. Pa
.
)) (“MDL No. 2724”).
In 2019 and 2020, Attorneys General of 
43
 States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico named the Company in two complaints alleging a similar conspiracy and seeking similar damages. These cases are pending in the District of Connecticut. See 
Connecticut, et al. v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., et al., 3:19-cv-00710-MPS
 and 
Connecticut, et al. v. Sandoz, Inc. et al., 3:20-cv-00802-MPS
.
Fact discovery is underway in MDL No. 2724 and in the State Attorneys General cases naming the Company as a defendant. Expert discovery is complete in 
Connecticut, et al. v. Sandoz, Inc. et al., 3:20-cv-00802-MPS. 
In 
Connecticut, et al. v. Sandoz, Inc. et al., 3:20-cv-00802-MSP, 
defendants’ joint motions for summary judgment were filed in November 2024 and defendant-specific motions for summary judgment are due in July 2025. In 
Connecticut, et al. v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., et al., 3:19-cv-00710-MPS
, defendants jointly moved to dismiss the complaint and Amneal individually moved to dismiss the states’ Ranitidine, Bethanechol, and overarching conspiracy claims. These motions were fully briefed on February 14, 2025. In the 
F-48
MDL, defendants including the Company and Impax jointly moved to dismiss certain complaints in December 2024. Amneal individually moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ Bethanechol Chloride claims in 
American Airlines, Inc., et al v. Actavis Holdco U.S., Inc., et al, 2:24-cv-01430
. These motions were fully briefed on February 20, 2025. The MDL Court ordered that trials for the first MDL cases chosen for bellwether treatment, none of which name the Company or Impax as defendants, will begin August 8, 2025. The MDL Court has identified the second round of MDL cases chosen for bellwether treatment, one of which names Impax as a defendant. No scheduling orders have been set. 
Civil Prescription Opioid Litigation
The Company is named in over 
900
 state and federal cases relating to the sale of prescription opioid pain relievers. Plaintiffs are political subdivisions, schools, hospitals, Native American tribes, pension funds, third-party payors, and individuals. Nearly all federal court cases are consolidated for pre-trial proceedings in Case No. 17-mdl-2804, USDC N.D. OH. The Company also is named in state court cases pending in 
seven
 states. There are no firm trial dates in those state-court cases except in Texas, where the trial date in the Dallas County case is September 29, 2025, and the trial-ready date in the Bexar County case is March 16, 2026.
The Company has received a subpoena from the New York Attorney General, a subpoena from the Maryland Attorney General, and a CID issued by the Alaska Attorney General all seeking information regarding its business concerning opioid-containing products. The Company has cooperated and continues to cooperate with these requests. 
In 2023, the Company reached settlements with the New Mexico Attorney General and West Virginia political subdivisions and a settlement in principle with a group of private hospitals in Alabama. In late April 2024, the Company reached a nationwide settlement in principle on the primary financial terms, with no admission of wrongdoing, for a nationwide resolution to the opioids cases filed and that might have been filed by state Attorneys General, political subdivisions and Native American tribes. The settlement in principle is subject to execution of a definitive settlement agreement. The settlement would be payable over 
ten years
. Under the settlement in principle, the Company would agree to pay $
92.5
 million in cash and provide $
180.0
 million (valued at $
125
/twin pack) in naloxone nasal spray to help treat opioid overdoses. In lieu of receiving product, the settling parties can opt to receive 
25
% of the naloxone nasal spray’s value (up to $
45.0
 million) in cash during the last 
four years
 of the 
ten years
 payment term, which could increase the total amount of cash the Company would agree to pay up to $
137.5
 million. 
As of March 31, 2024, the Company concluded the loss related to the opioid litigation was probable, and the related loss was reasonably estimable considering the settlement in principle. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $
94.4
 million associated with the settlement in principle during the three months ended March 31, 2024, to increase the liability as of March 31, 2024 to $
115.6
 million. The liability as of December 31, 2024 was $
115.2
 million, of which $
85.5
 million was classified as long-term. While this liability has been deemed reasonable by the Company’s management, it could significantly change as the definitive settlement agreement is finalized. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a liability of $
21.5
 million related to its prescription opioid litigation, of which $
0.3
 million was classified as long-term. For the remaining cases not covered by the settlement in principle, primarily brought by other hospitals, schools and individuals, the Company has not recorded a liability as of December 31, 2024 or 2023, because it concluded that a loss was not probable and estimable.
United States Department of Justice / Drug Enforcement Administration Subpoenas 
On July 7, 2017, Amneal Pharmaceuticals of New York, LLC received an administrative subpoena issued by the Long Island, NY District Office of the Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”) requesting information related to compliance with certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements. On or about April 12, 2019 and May 28, 2019, the Company received grand jury subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York (the “USAO”) relating to similar topics concerning the Company’s suspicious order monitoring program and its compliance with the Controlled Substances Act. The Company is cooperating with the USAO in responding to the subpoenas. The Company has entered into a tolling agreement with respect to potential criminal charges through May 15, 2025. The Company entered into a tolling agreement with the USAO that tolled the statute of limitations for potential civil claims through November 15, 2024. It is not possible to determine the exact outcome of these investigations. 
On March 14, 2019, Amneal received a subpoena from an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida (the “AUSA”). The subpoena requested information and documents generally related to the marketing, sale, and distribution of oxymorphone. The Company is cooperating with the AUSA regarding the subpoena. However, no assurance can be given as to the timing or outcome of its underlying investigation.
F-49
On October 7, 2019, Amneal received a subpoena from the New York State Department of Financial Services seeking documents and information related to sales of opioid products in the state of New York. The Company is cooperating with the request and providing responsive information. It is not possible to determine the exact outcome of this investigation.  
Ranitidine Litigation
The Company was named, along with numerous other brand and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors, retail pharmacy chains, and repackagers of ranitidine-containing products in a federal MDL (In 
re Zantac/Ranitidine NDMA Litigation
 (MDL No. 2924), Southern District of Florida). Plaintiffs alleged defendants failed to disclose and/or concealed the alleged inherent presence of N-Nitrosodimethylamine (or “NDMA”) in ranitidine products and the alleged associated risk of cancer. The MDL Court’s dismissal of claims by all plaintiffs against the Company and other generic drug manufacturers on preemption grounds is on appeal in the 11th Circuit. Plaintiffs filed their merits brief on April 10, 2024. The generic drug manufacturers, including the Company, filed their briefs on July 25, 2024. Plaintiffs’ reply brief was filed November 8, 2024. The briefing also addresses the MDL Court’s December 6, 2022 exclusion of plaintiff’s general causation experts. The 11th Circuit has not set an oral argument date.
The Company has also been named in state court cases in 
four
 states. The Company has filed motions to dismiss those cases. On August 17, 2023, the judge in the consolidated Illinois state court cases granted a motion to dismiss all such cases in which the Company had been named, holding all claims preempted. On December 10, 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion in the Illinois state court cases seeking entry of partial final judgment as to the Company and other generic drug manufacturer defendants to allow plaintiffs to appeal the dismissals of those defendants
. The Company has reached an agreement in principle, which is not material, to settle the 
95
 cases pending against it in California state court. Currently, there is a September 15, 2025 trial date in the one case pending in New Mexico brought by the Attorney General, but the court recently indicated that date is likely to be continued. There are no other trial dates involving the Company in any of the state court cases.
Metformin Litigation
Beginning in 2020, Amneal was named as a defendant in several putative class action lawsuits filed and consolidated in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, seeking compensation for economic loss allegedly incurred in connection with their purchase of generic metformin allegedly contaminated with NDMA. See 
In Re Metformin Marketing and Sales Practices Litigation 
(No. 2:20-cv-02324-MCA-MAH) (“
In re Metformin
”), 
Marcia E. Brice v. Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 
No. 2:20-cv-13728 (D.N.J.), and 
Michael Hann v. Amneal Pharmaceuticals of New York, LLC et al.
, No. 2:23-cv-22902 (D.N.J.). On January 7, 2025, the court dismissed the Third Amended Complaint in 
In Re Metformin
 without prejudice and granted plaintiffs the opportunity to amend their complaint. On February 20, 2025, plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Complaint in 
In Re Metformin, 
which incorporated the allegations of plaintiff Brice and plaintiff Hann, and then filed notices of voluntary dismissal of 
Marcia E. Brice v. Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 
No. 2:20-cv-13728 (D.N.J.) and 
Michael Hann v. Amneal Pharmaceuticals of New York, LLC et al.
, No. 2:23-cv-22902 (D.N.J.) as standalone actions. Defendants will file a motion to dismiss the Fourth Amended Complaint by March 7, 2025. Plaintiffs’ response in opposition is due on April 7, 2025 and defendants’ reply is due on April 22, 2025.
On March 29, 2021, a plaintiff filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama asserting claims against manufacturers of valsartan, losartan, and metformin based on the alleged presence of nitrosamines in those products. The only allegations against the Company concern metformin (See 
Davis v. Camber Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
, et al., C.A. No. 2:21-00254 (M.D. Ala.) (the “Davis Action”)). On May 5, 2021, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation transferred the Davis Action into the 
In re: Valsartan, Losartan, and Irbesartan Products Liability Litigation
 MDL for pretrial proceedings.
Xyrem
®
 (Sodium Oxybate) Antitrust Litigation
Amneal was named as a defendant, along with Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Jazz”) and numerous other manufacturers of generic versions of Jazz’s Xyrem
®
 (sodium oxybate), in several class action lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleging that the generic manufacturers entered into anticompetitive agreements with Jazz in connection with the settlement of patent litigation related to Xyrem
®
. The actions were consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California for pretrial proceedings (
In re Xyrem (Sodium Oxybate) Antitrust Litigation
, No. 5:20-md-02966-LHK (N.D. Cal.)). 
F-50
Amneal was also named as a defendant in a similar action filed by Aetna Inc. (“Aetna”) in California state court 
(Aetna Inc. v. Jazz Pharms., Inc. et. al
, No. 22CV010951 (Cal. Super. Ct.)). The California state court held that it lacks jurisdiction over several defendants, including Amneal, on December 27, 2022, and later issued an order dismissing Amneal without prejudice. On August 25, 2023, Aetna filed a motion seeking leave to file a second amended complaint adding Amneal as a defendant, which the Court tentatively granted on October 20, 2023. Aetna filed a second amended complaint naming Amneal on November 17, 2023.
On February 28, 2023, Amneal executed a $
1.9
 million settlement agreement with class plaintiffs in the federal litigation. 
Class plaintiffs filed a motion for final approval of the settlement on November 10, 2023, and entered an order granting final approval, certifying settlement class, and dismissing class plaintiffs’ against Amneal with prejudice on April 17, 2024. On December 18, 2023, Amneal executed a $
4.0
 million settlement with Aetna, United Healthcare Services, Inc. (“United”), Humana Inc. (“Humana”), Molina Healthcare Inc. (“Molina”), and Health Care Service Corporation (“HCSC”). Pursuant to that settlement, the federal court dismissed United, Humana, Molina and HCSC’s claims against Amneal, with prejudice, on February 26, 2024, and the California state court dismissed Aetna’s claims against Amneal, with prejudice, on February 29, 2024. Thus, all claims against Amneal in the federal and state court have been voluntarily dismissed with prejudice pursuant to settlements. In December 2023, the Company recorded $
3.0
 million for the settlement of claims associated with Xyrem
®
 antitrust litigation. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a liability of $
2.0
 million associated with this settlement, which was paid in January 2024.

That motion remains pending, and the deadline to respond to the complaint is set at 
45
 days after the court resolves the motion to transfer.
Indian Tax Authority Matters
Amneal Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd., RAKS Pharmaceuticals Pvt. Ltd., and Puniska Healthcare Pvt. Ltd., which are subsidiaries of the Company, are currently involved in litigations with Indian tax authorities concerning Central Excise Tax, Service Tax, Goods & Services Tax, and Value Added Tax for various periods of time between 2014 and 2017. These subsidiaries have contested certain of these assessments, which are at various stages of the administrative process.

Guaifenesin Litigation
On September 5, 2024, Amneal was named as a defendant along with CVS Pharmacy, Inc. (“CVS”) in a putative consumer class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that generic guaifenesin products manufactured by Amneal contain benzene through the use of carbomer, an inactive ingredient. See 
Leonard v. CVS Pharmacy, Inc.
, No. 5:24-cv-06280 (N.D. Cal.).

Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC et al. v. Sandoz Inc., D.N.J. 3:25-cv-00181-GC-TJB
On November 25, 2024, the Company and Impax received a notice letter from Sandoz Inc. (“Sandoz”) stating that it had filed an ANDA with the FDA seeking approval to market generic versions of CREXONT
®
, an extended-release oral capsule formulation of carbidopa and levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. The notice letter included a Paragraph IV certification alleging that certain patents covering CREXONT
®
 are invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of Sandoz’s generic product.
In response to this notice letter, on January 7, 2025, the Company and Impax filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Sandoz in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 10,098,845, 10,292,935, 
F-51
10,688,058, 10,973,769, 10,987,313, 11,357,733, 11,622,941, 11,666,538, 11,986,449, 12,064,521, 12,109,185, and 12,128,141. The current deadline for Sandoz to respond to the complaint is March 11, 2025. The filing of this lawsuit triggered a 30-month stay of FDA approval of the Sandoz ANDA from the date of receipt of the notice letter. CREXONT
®
 is also subject to a regulatory exclusivity until August 7, 2027.
21. 
Stockholders’ (Deficiency) Equity
On November 7, 2023, the Company implemented the Reorganization, a plan pursuant to which the Company and Amneal reorganized and simplified the Company’s corporate structure by eliminating its umbrella partnership-C-corporation structure and converting to a more traditional C-corporation structure whereby all stockholders hold their voting and economic interests directly through the public company. Effective with the Reorganization, the Company holds 
100
% of the Amneal Common Units.  Refer to 
Note 1. Nature of Operations
 for additional information on the Reorganization.
In connection with the Reorganization, the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation (“Charter”). The voting rights, dividend rights and participation rights of holders of Class A common stock of the Company did not materially change as a result of the amendment. There were 
no
 shares of Class B common stock of the Company outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Voting Rights
Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to 
one
 vote for each share of stock held, except as required by law. Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock vote together as a single class on each matter submitted to a stockholder vote, including to elect, remove or replace all other directors to the Board subject to rights of holders of any preferred stock. Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are not entitled to vote on any amendment to the Company’s Charter that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of preferred stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote on such terms pursuant to the Company’s Charter or law.  Holders of Class A common stock do not have cumulative voting rights.
Dividend Rights
The holders of Class A common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if any, payable in cash, property, or securities of the Company, as may be declared by the Company's board of directors, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, subject to any preferential or other rights of the holders of any outstanding shares of preferred stock. The holders of Class B common stock will not be entitled to receive any dividends.
Participation Rights
The holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock have no participation rights. 
Issuance and Restrictions on Company Common Stock
No shares of Class B  common stock may be issued except to a holder of Common Units or its affiliates. 
Liquidation Rights
On the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of Class A common stock are entitled to share equally in all assets of the Company available for distribution among the stockholders of the Company after payment to all creditors and subject to any preferential or other rights of the holders of any outstanding shares of preferred stock. The holders of Class B common stock are not entitled to share in such net assets.
Preferred Stock
Under the Company’s Charter, the Company’s Board of Directors has the authority to issue preferred stock and set its rights and preferences. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, 
no
 preferred stock had been issued.
Non-Controlling Interests
As discussed in 
Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
, the consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of all entities controlled by the Company, including Amneal and its subsidiaries, through the Company’s direct or indirect ownership of a majority voting interest. The Company records non-controlling interests for the portion of its 
F-52
subsidiaries’ economic interests that it does not hold. Prior to the Reorganization, non-controlling interests were adjusted for capital transactions that impacted the non-publicly held economic interests in Amneal.
Prior to the Reorganization, 
Amneal was obligated to make tax distributions to the Members. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded net tax distributions of $
56.7
 million and $
10.6
 million, respectively, as a reduction of non-controlling interests. Subsequent to the Reorganization, the Company is no longer obligated to make tax distributions to the Members. There was 
no
 liability for tax distributions payable to Members as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
The Company acquired a 
98
%
 interest in Kashiv Specialty Pharmaceuticals, LLC (“KSP”) on April 2, 2021. The sellers of KSP, a related party, hold the remaining interest. The Company attributes 
2
% of the net income or loss of KSP to these non-controlling interests. 
Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests - AvKARE, LLC and R&S
The Company acquired a 
65.1
% interest in both AvKARE, LLC and R&S on January 31, 2020. The sellers hold the remaining 
34.9
% interest (“Rondo Class B Units”) in the holding company that directly owns the acquired companies (“Rondo”). Beginning on January 1, 2026, the holders of the Rondo Class B Units have the right (“Put Right”) to require the Company to acquire the Rondo Class B Units for a purchase price that is based on a multiple of Rondo’s earnings before income taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) if certain financial targets and other conditions are met. Additionally, beginning on January 31, 2020, the Company has the right to acquire the Rondo Class B Units based on the same value and conditions as the Put Right (the “Call Option”). The sellers holding the Rondo Class B Units have the one-time right to defer the exercise of the Call Option until the subsequent calendar year. The Rondo Class B Units are also redeemable by the holders upon a change in control. Since the redemption of the Rondo Class B Units is outside of the Company’s control, the units have been presented outside of stockholders’ equity as redeemable non-controlling interests. The Company attributes 
34.9
% of the net income of Rondo to the redeemable non-controlling interests. The Company will also accrete the redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value upon an event that makes redemption certain. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, tax distributions of $
19.8
 million, $
14.2
 million and $
6.9
 million, respectively, were recorded as reductions of redeemable non-controlling interests
. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were 
no
 amounts due for tax distributions related to these redeemable non-controlling interests.
Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests - Puniska Healthcare Pvt. Ltd.
The Company acquired a 
74
% interest in Puniska Healthcare Pvt. Ltd. (“Puniska”) on November 2, 2021. Amneal was required pursuant to the purchase agreement to acquire the remaining 
26
% of Puniska upon approval of the transaction by the government of India.

Since approval of the government of India was outside of the Company’s control, upon closing of the Puniska Acquisition, the equity interests of Puniska that the Company did not own were presented outside of stockholders’ equity as redeemable non-controlling interests. The Company attributed 
26
% of the net losses of Puniska to the redeemable non-controlling interests.
Upon approval of the transaction by the government of India in March 2022, the Company paid the $
1.7
 million redemption value for the remaining 
26
% of the equity interests of Puniska. For the year ended December 31, 
2022
, t
he Company recorded accretion of $
0.9
 million to increase the redeemable non-controlling interests to redemption value.

Stock-Based Compensation
Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2018 Incentive Award Plan
In May 2018, the Company adopted the Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2018 Incentive Award Plan (“2018 Plan”) under which the Company may grant stock options, restricted stock units and other equity-based awards to employees and non-employee directors providing services to the Company and its subsidiaries. The stock option, RSU and MPRSU award grants are made in accordance with the Company’s 2018 Plan and are subject to forfeiture if the vesting conditions are not met. 
On May 5, 2020, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the 2018 Plan, which authorized an additional 
14
 million shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the 2018 Plan. 
On May 9, 2023, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment and restatement of the 2018 Plan, which authorized an additional 
20
 million shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the 2018 Plan, resulting in a total shares reserved under the Stock Plan of 
57
 million shares, and extends the term of the 2018 Plan until May 9, 2033. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
23,723,461
 shares available for issuance under the 2018 Plan.
The Company recognizes the grant date fair value of each option and share of restricted stock unit over its vesting period. Stock options and RSU awards are granted under the Company’s 2018 Plan and generally vest over a 
4
 year period and, in the case of stock options, have a term of 
10
 years.

Related Party Transaction Descriptions
A. Kashiv Biosciences LLC
Kashiv Biosciences LLC (“Kashiv”) is a vertically integrated biopharmaceutical company with a diverse portfolio of commercial and clinical-stage assets. Amneal has various business agreements with Kashiv. Certain executive officers of the Company beneficially own, directly and through certain revocable or irrevocable trusts for the benefit of their immediate families, outstanding equity securities of Kashiv. In addition, they serve on the Board of Managers of Kashiv.
On January 11, 2021, the Company and Kashiv entered into a definitive agreement for Amneal to acquire a 
98
% interest in KSP, which was a subsidiary of Kashiv and focuses on the development of complex generics, innovative drug delivery platforms and novel 505(b)(2) drugs. The acquisition closed on April 2, 2021 and included contingent payments for the achievement of certain regulatory milestones and potential royalty payments based on annual net sales for certain future pharmaceutical products.  As of December 31, 2023, the contingent consideration liability associated with the acquisition of KSP of $
0.4
 million was recorded within related party payables - long term.
  Contingent consideration liability was $
0
 as of December 31, 2024.
Below is a summary of the related party arrangements held between the Company and Kashiv that were not impacted by the KSP Acquisition:
i.
On July 1, 2024, Kashiv and Amneal entered into an exclusive license and commercialization agreement to distribute and sell Omalizumab, a biosimilar to XOLAIR
®
, in the U.S. and India. Kashiv is responsible for development, regulatory filings, obtaining FDA approval, and manufacturing for the product, and Amneal is responsible for marketing, selling, and pricing activities. The term of the agreement is 
10
 years from the respective product’s launch date and automatically renews for terms of 
three years
 unless either party provides written notification of termination.
The agreement requires the Company to pay $
10.0
 million as an up-front amount to Kashiv and potential future milestone payments of up to $
75.0
 million, upon achieving certain developmental and regulatory achievements within agreed-upon timelines. The milestones include: (i) up to $
32.5
 million in developmental milestone payments, (ii) $
22.5
 million in regulatory approval and commercial launch milestone payments, and (iii) a $
20.0
 million sales-based milestone payment, which is contingent upon reaching a defined annual commercial sales volume for the product. In addition, the agreement provides for Amneal to pay a profit share up to 
45
% of net profits, after considering manufacturing, marketing, royalty and shipping costs.
F-58
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company expensed amounts paid to Kashiv for: (i) the upfront amount of $
10.0
 million in connection with the execution of the agreement and (ii) an additional $
10.0
 million related to the first developmental milestone.
ii.
In 2017, Kashiv and Amneal entered into an exclusive license and commercialization agreement (the “Kashiv Biosimilar Agreement”) to distribute and sell 
two
 biosimilar products, Filgrastim and Pegfilgrastim, in the U.S. Kashiv is responsible for development, regulatory filings, obtaining FDA approval, and manufacturing, and Amneal is responsible for marketing, selling, and pricing activities. The term of the agreement is 
10
 years from the respective product’s launch date. 
The Kashiv Biosimilar Agreement provided for potential future milestone payments to Kashiv of up to $
183.0
 million, as follows: (i) up to $
22.5
 million relating to regulatory approval and execution, (ii) up to $
43.0
 million for successful delivery of commercial launch inventory, (iii) up to $
50.0
 million depending on the number of competitors at launch for one product, and (iv) between $
15.0
 million and $
67.5
 million for the achievement of cumulative net sales for both products. 
In July 2022, the Company and Kashiv amended the Kashiv Biosimilar Agreement to, among other things, (i) eliminate milestones related to the manufacturing and delivery of the Kashiv products, (ii) revise the net sales milestones to provide for future milestone payments by the Company to Kashiv of up to $
37.5
 million for the achievement of cumulative combined net sales goals for both products, and (iii) adjust the supply price of product that Kashiv manufacturers and supplies to the Company, which will lower the cost per unit of both products. 
The remaining milestones are subject to reaching certain commercial sales volume objectives. In addition, the agreement provides for Amneal to pay a profit share equal to 
50
% of net profits, after considering manufacturing and marketing costs. 
On May 27, 2022, the FDA approved the Company’s biologic license application, associated with the amended Kashiv Biosimilar Agreement, for Pegfilgrastim-pbbk. In connection with this regulatory approval and associated activity, the Company incurred and paid a milestone of $
15.0
 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, payable to Kashiv. The milestone was capitalized as an intangible asset and will be amortized to cost of sales over an estimated useful life of 
8.3
 years.
The Company recognized a $
5.0
 million milestone in selling, general and administrative expense upon FDA approval of Filgrastim in February 2022.
In March 2024, the Company amended the Kashiv Biosimilar Agreement to include 
two
 additional in-development products, a pre-filled auto-injector delivery system for peg-filgrastim and a pre-filled on-body injector (OBI) delivery system for peg-filgrastim. Consistent with the existing terms, Kashiv is responsible for development, regulatory filings, obtaining FDA approval, and manufacturing, and Amneal is responsible for marketing, selling, and pricing activities of these product candidates. The amendment did not change the contractual terms related to existing commercialized biosimilar products.
The amendment provides an incremental $
14.5
 million in potential future milestone payments specific to these in-development products, including $
7.0
 million for clinical and developmental milestones and $
7.5
 million for regulatory approval and first commercial-sales milestones. In addition, the amendment clarifies that future net sales milestones payments of up to $
37.5
 million, which did not change, shall be contingent upon reaching certain commercial sales volume objectives for the aggregate of all products under the amended agreement. The agreement provides for Amneal to pay a profit share equal to 
50
% of net profits, after considering manufacturing and marketing costs. 
No amounts were paid or recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024, pursuant to this amendment
.

four
 generic product candidates. Amneal is responsible for manufacturing batch products and performing certain developmental activities on behalf of Kashiv. Kashiv, as owner of the intellectual property, is responsible for regulatory filings, obtaining FDA approval, marketing, selling, and pricing activities. Pursuant to the terms of the development supply agreement, Amneal is eligible to earn up to $
2.4
 million related to the aforementioned services. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deferred revenue related to this arrangement was $
0.2
 within accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet.
F-59
Pursuant to the development supply agreement, Amneal maintained a right of first offer and negotiation to the licensing of each generic product candidate. In March 2024, Amneal and Kashiv entered into a license and supply agreement for the development and commercialization of a long-acting injectable (the “Injectable License and Supply Agreement”). The existing development supply agreement remains effective for the remaining 
three
 generic product candidates.
Subject to the terms of the Injectable License and Supply Agreement, Amneal is responsible for development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of the product candidate in the U.S., whereas Kashiv is responsible for development and regulatory approval of the product candidate for all other territories outside the U.S. Contingent upon Kashiv obtaining regulatory approval outside the U.S., Amneal shall manufacture the commercial supply for Kashiv at a stated price. The term of the agreement is 
10
 years from the respective product’s launch date in the U.S.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded R&D expense of $
10.5
 million comprised of (i) $
0.5
 million for payment made upon execution of the license and supply agreement and (ii) $
10.0
 million for the achievement of a regulatory milestone upon the FDA’s written acceptance of a drug approval application filing. The agreement provides for potential future milestone payments to Kashiv of up to $

50
% of net profits, after considering manufacturing and marketing costs. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had a liability of $
10.0

Segment Information
The Company has 
three
 reportable segments: Affordable Medicines (formerly known as Generics), Specialty, and AvKARE.
F-63
During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company changed the name of its Generics segment to “Affordable Medicines” to reflect the full product offering of the segment. The name change did not result in any change to the composition of the Company’s reportable segments and, therefore, did not result in any change to its historical results.
Affordable Medicines
The Company’s Affordable Medicines segment includes approximately 
270
 product families covering an extensive range of dosage forms and delivery systems, including both immediate and extended-release oral solids, powders, liquids, sterile injectables, nasal sprays, inhalation and respiratory products, biosimilar products, ophthalmics, films, transdermal patches and topicals.
Specialty
The Company’s Specialty segment includes branded products, primarily focused on central nervous system disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, and endocrine disorders.
AvKARE
The Company’s AvKARE segment provides pharmaceuticals, medical and surgical products and services primarily to governmental agencies, predominantly focused on the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. AvKARE is a re-packager of bottle and unit dose pharmaceuticals under the registered names of AvKARE and AvPAK. AvKARE is also a wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals, over the counter drugs and medical supplies to its retail and institutional customers that are located throughout the U.S. focused primarily on entities that provide care to low-income and uninsured patients. Operating results for the sale of Amneal products by AvKARE are included in the Company’s Affordable Medicines reportable segment.
Chief Operating Decision Makers
The Company’s Co-Chief Executive Officers are the Company’s chief operating decision makers (“CODMs”). The CODMs evaluate the financial performance of the Company based upon segment operating income (loss). Items below operating income (loss) are not reported by segment, since they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by the Company’s CODMs. Additionally, general and administrative expenses, certain selling expenses, certain litigation settlements, and non-operating income and expenses are included in “Corporate and Other.” The Company does not report balance sheet information by segment since it is not reviewed by the Company’s CODMs.
The tables below present segment information reconciled to total Company financial results, with segment operating income or loss, including gross profit less direct selling expenses, R&D expenses, and other operating expenses to the extent specifically identified by segment (in thousands):
