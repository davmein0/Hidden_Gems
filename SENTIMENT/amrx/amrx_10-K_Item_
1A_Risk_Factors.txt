Inflation 
While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation, we estimate our business did not experience a material increase in costs due to inflation for the year ended December 31, 2024. We do not expect a material impact related to inflation for the year ending December 31, 2025. Notwithstanding our estimates, rising inflationary pressures due to higher input costs, including higher material, transportation, labor and other costs, could exceed our expectations and may adversely impact our operating results in future periods.

Net Revenue
Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased 16.7% from the prior year primarily due to:
•
Growth in our Affordable Medicines segment of $213.9 million, primarily due to new products launched in 2024 and 2023, which included biosimilars that contributed $59.7 million of year-over-year growth and other new products that contributed $144.1 million of year-over-year growth, and strong volume growth, partially offset by price erosion. Net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023 included a non-recurring customer order of $21.0 million.
•
Growth in our AvKARE segment of $131.2 million primarily driven by growth in our distribution and government channels resulting from new product introductions.
•
Growth in our Specialty segment of $55.3 million primarily driven by a $44.7 million increase in our promoted Parkinson’s franchise, of which $16.6 million was comprised of sales of ONGENTYS
®
, which launched in January 2024, and initial sales of CREXONT
®
, which launched in September 2024. Additionally, growth in our promoted endocrinology portfolio of $20.8 million was partially offset by declines in our non-promoted products.
Cost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit
Cost of goods sold increased 12.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the prior year. The increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to increased AvKARE and Affordable Medicines volume, 
increased plant and freight costs, and an increased inventory provision, partially offset by efficiencies in our supply costs. 
Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2023 included $11.0 million associated with the non-recurring customer order in our Affordable Medicines segment discussed above and a marketed product intangible asset impairment charge of $34.1 million in our Specialty segment related to a reduction in the promotional focus on LYVISPAH
®
.
Gross profit as a percentage of net revenue increased to 36.5% for the year ended December 31, 2024 from 34.3% in the prior year, primarily as a result of the factors noted above.
55
Selling, General and Administrative
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased 10.9% as compared to the prior year primarily due to increases in employee compensation, promotion associated with ONGENTYS
®
 and CREXONT
®
, increased expenses associated with our growing biosimilars, and annual fees assessed on branded prescription drug manufacturers, which are also applicable to certain of our Affordable Medicines products.  
Research and Development
Research and development (“R&D”) expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased 16.3% from the prior year primarily due to an increase in in-licensing and upfront milestone payments of $30.0 million, including $20.0 million associated with our exclusive license of Omalizumab (refer to 
Note 23. Related Party Transactions
 for additional information), partially offset by operating efficiencies in our infrastructure.
In-Process Research and Development Impairment Charges
In process research and development (“IPR&D”) impairment charges of $30.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 were related to one Affordable Medicines asset and one Specialty asset, both of which experienced adverse clinical trials results in the fourth quarter of 2023 and resulted in significantly lower than expected future cash flows.
Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration
The year-over-year variance of 
$13.6 million
 in change in fair value of contingent consideration for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the prior year was primarily related to a reduction in promotional focus on LYVISPAH
TM
 during the year ended December 31, 2023.  Refer to 
Note 18. Fair Value Measurements
 for additional information.
Charges Related to Legal Matters, Net
For the year ended December 31, 2024, charges related to legal matters, net of $96.7 million were primarily associated with an Affordable Medicines settlement in principle on the primary financial terms for a nationwide resolution to the opioids cases that have been filed and that might have been filed against us by political subdivisions and Native American tribes across the U.S. 
For the year ended December 31, 2023,  charges related to legal matters, net of 
$1.8 million were 
comprised of $3.9 million in charges associated with Affordable Medicines civil prescription opioid litigation, a $3.0 million charge for the settlement of an Affordable Medicines customer claim, a $3.0 million charge for the settlement of Affordable Medicines commercial antitrust litigation, and a $1.9 million charge for the settlement of a corporate stockholder derivative lawsuit, partially offset by $10.0 million from the settlement of Affordable Medicines patent infringement matters. 
For additional information, refer to 
Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies.
Total Other Expense, Net
Total other expense, net increased 24.4% for the year ended December 31, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by a $48.0 million increase in net interest expense as a result of higher rates on our variable rate debt 
and an increase in the average amount outstanding on our revolving credit facility throughout 2024, and a 
$47.6 million
 increase in our tax receivable agreement liability (refer to 
Note 6. Income Taxes
 for additional information), partially offset by a $40.8 million loss on refinancing the Term Loan Due 2025 and amending the New Revolving Credit Facility in 2023 (refer to 
Note 15. Debt
 for additional information).
Provision For Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes was $18.9 million and $8.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 
2023
, respectively. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 
2023
 were (34.3)% and 
(21.0)%
, respectively.  
The change in the effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to the timing and jurisdictional mix of income and the Reorganization, which resulted in allocating all of Amneal’s income to the Company. Refer to 
Note 6. Income Taxes
 for additional information.

Selling, General, and Administrative
AvKARE SG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased 9.7% as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher sales-related expenses, increases in employee compensation and higher professional fees. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary source of liquidity is cash generated from operations, available cash and borrowings under debt financing arrangements (as defined and described in 
Note 15. Debt
), including $495.2 million of available capacity on our Amended New Revolving Credit Facility
 and $28.0 million of available capacity under the Amended Rondo Revolving Credit Facility as of 
December 31, 2024
. 
We believe these sources are sufficient to fund our planned operations, meet our interest and contractual obligations and provide sufficient liquidity over the next 12 months. However, our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and debt obligations will depend upon economic conditions, our ability to negotiate and maintain satisfactory terms under our borrowing and debt facilities in the future, and demand for our products, which are factors that may be out of our control. Our primary uses of capital resources are to fund operating activities, including R&D expenses associated with new product filings, and pharmaceutical product manufacturing expenses, license payments, spending on production facility expansions, capital equipment, acquisitions, and legal settlements. 
We estimate that we will invest approximately $120.0 million during 2025 for capital expenditures to support and grow our existing operations, primarily related to investments in manufacturing equipment, IT and facilities.  Our 2025 estimate includes capital expenditures for our collaboration and supply agreement with Metsera, of which we expect Metsera to reimburse us approximately $20.0 million.  We expect such reimbursements to primarily be included in our financing cash flows.  
Debt Instruments
Over the next 12 months, we expect to make substantial payments for monthly interest and quarterly principal amounts due for our Term Loan Due 2028, monthly interest on our Amended New Credit Facility, and contractual payments for leased premises. 
In January 2025, the Company paid the entire remaining principal balance of $192.0 million outstanding on its Term 
59
Loan Due 2025, plus accrued interest thereon of $0.7 million, with $190.0 million of new borrowings under the Amended New Revolving Credit Facility and cash on hand.  
Annually, we are also required to calculate the amount of excess cash flow payments, as defined in our term loan agreements. Based on the results of the excess cash flows calculation for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, no excess cash flows principal payments were required. 
Settlement in Principle on Nationwide Civil Prescription Opioid Litigation
In late April 2024, we reached a nationwide settlement in principle on the primary financial terms, with no admission of wrongdoing, for a nationwide resolution to the opioids cases that have been filed and that might have been filed by Attorneys General, political subdivisions and Native American tribes. Refer to 
Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies
 for additional information. Refer to 
Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies 
for additional information.
Tax Receivable Agreement
As part of the Reorganization, our existing tax receivable agreement (“TRA”) was amended to reduce our future obligation to pay 85% of the realized tax benefits subject to the TRA to 75% of such realized benefits. As of December 31, 2024, the unrecorded contingent TRA liability, including the impact of the amendment, was $133.8 million.
The timing and amount of any payments under the TRA may vary, depending upon a number of factors including the timing and amount of our taxable income, and the corporate tax rate in effect at the time of realization of our taxable income. The timing and amount of payments may also be accelerated under certain conditions, such as a change of control or other early termination event, which could give rise to our obligation to make TRA payments in advance of tax benefits being realized. 
For further information, refer to
