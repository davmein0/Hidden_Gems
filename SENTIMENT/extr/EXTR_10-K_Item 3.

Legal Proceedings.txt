Industry Background
Enterprises across every industry are going through unprecedented changes, such as digital transformation initiatives, migrating their workloads to cloud-based environments, modernizing applications, finding new ways to leverage multimodal and agentic AI technology, and adapting to a distributed workforce. To accomplish this, they are adopting new Information Technology (“IT”) delivery models and applications that require fundamental network alterations and enhancements spanning from the access edge to the data center. As networks become more complex and more distributed in nature, we believe IT teams in every industry will need more control and better insights than ever before to deliver secure, distributed connectivity and comprehensive centralized visibility. Networking is mission critical and touches all elements of how services are delivered to customers, employees, students, and patients. Managing networks from a single platform that integrates AI networking and security is critical to help reduce complexity and minimize the time it takes to complete tasks. A new category has emerged in the industry to address challenges related to managing the breadth and depth of complexities related to network administration, deployment and on-going management termed 
AI for networking
.  This new category is defined by innovation in generative, multimodal and agentic AI technology.

As the edge of the network continues to expand, our customers are managing more endpoints which comes with a host of challenges. This continued expansion creates issues such as a higher risk of cyberattacks and a need for more bandwidth due to an increase in applications running across the network.
Network complexity manifests itself in the form of more endpoints to manage, more applications to monitor, and more services that rely on the network for service delivery and enablement. When performance suffers, and the tug on internal systems and IT staff becomes more intense, technology is often being overworked. Resolving network problems expeditiously and identifying their root cause, can improve organizational productivity and result in higher performance of operations. 
AI for networking
 is needed to improve an IT team’s agility and responsiveness to address these challenges.

We believe that the network has never been more vital than it is today. As administrators grapple with more data, coming from more places, more connected devices, and more Software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) based applications, the cloud is fundamental to managing and maintaining a modern network. Traditional network offerings are not well-suited to fulfill enterprise expectations for rapid delivery of new services, more flexible business models, real-time response, and massive scalability. We expect Extreme Platform ONE to deliver significant productivity gains for IT teams by streamlining network design, deployment, management, and commercial operations through its generative, multimodal, and agentic AI capabilities.

As enterprises continue to migrate increasing numbers of applications and services to either private clouds or public clouds offered by third parties and to adopt new IT delivery models and applications, they are required to make fundamental network alterations and enhancements spanning from wireless access points (“APs”) to the network core. In either case, the network infrastructure must adapt to this new dynamic environment. AI and automation are key if enterprises are to derive maximum benefit from their cloud deployments. With automation applications becoming increasingly critical in manufacturing, warehousing, logistics, healthcare and other key industries, we believe this will continue to create demand for networking technology to serve as a foundation to run these services.
Service providers are investing in network enhancements with platforms and applications that deliver data insights, provide flexibility, and can quickly respond to new user demands and 5G use cases. The scale of issues and challenges seen within service provider networks is even greater than the enterprise network -- thus they too can greatly benefit from operational gains from Extreme Platform ONE.
We believe Extreme will continue to benefit from the use of its technology to manage distributed campus network architecture centrally from the cloud. Extreme has blended a dynamic network fabric architecture that delivers simplicity for moves and changes at the edge of the network, together with corporate-wide role-based policy. This enables customers to migrate to new cloud managed switching, Wi-Fi, and SD-WAN, agnostic of the existing switching or wireless equipment they already have installed. In the end, we expect these customers to see lower operating and capital expenditures, lower subscription costs, lower overall cost of ownership and more flexibility along with a more resilient network, powered by Extreme Platform ONE.
We estimate the total addressable market (“TAM”) for our networking solutions, consisting of cloud networking, wireless local area networks (“WLAN”), campus local area networks (“LAN”), Ethernet switching, data center networking, SD-WAN solutions, and elements of the Secure Access Service Edge (“SASE”), exceeded $42 billion in calendar year 2024. Based on data from 650 Group, Gartner, IDC, and Dell'Oro Group, demand is projected to grow at a five-year compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of approximately 7%, reaching $59 billion by 2029. Within this market, cloud-managed networking solutions are expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 15% through 2029. And with Extreme Platform ONE, we are addressing AI Networking for the Campus, a high-growth segment forecasted to grow at a 72% CAGR over the next five years.

Extreme maintains distribution agreements with our largest distributors, Westcon Group Inc., TD Synnex Corporation and Jenne Inc. on substantially the same material terms as we generally enter into with each of our distribution partners. Distributors are generally given the right to return a portion of inventory to us for the purpose of stock rotation, to claim rebates for competitive discounts and participate in various cooperative marketing programs to promote the sale of our products and services.
•
Resellers
. We rely on many resellers worldwide that sell directly to the end-user customer. Our resellers include regional networking system resellers, resellers who focus on specific vertical markets, value added resellers, network integrators and wholesale resellers. We provide training and support to our resellers and our resellers generally provide the first level of contact to end-users of our products. Our relationships with resellers are on a non-exclusive basis. Our resellers are not given rights to return inventory and do not automatically participate in any cooperative marketing programs.
•
Field Sales
. Our field sales organization is trained to sell solutions, support and develop leads for our resellers and to establish and maintain key accounts and strategic end-user customers. To support these objectives, our field sales force:
o
Assists end-user customers in finding solutions to complex network system and architecture problems;
o
Differentiates the features and capabilities of our products from competitive offerings;
o
Continually monitors and understands the evolving networking needs of enterprise and service provider customers;
o
Promotes our products and ensures direct contact with current and potential customers; and
o
Assists our resellers to drive business opportunities to closure.
Although we compete in many vertical markets, we have focused on the specific verticals of healthcare, education, retail, manufacturing, government, sports, and entertainment venues. Years of experience and a track record of success in the verticals we serve enable us to address industry-specific problems.

Customer Profiles

Extreme’s customers are organizations facing complex IT challenges and/or undergoing digital transformation. These customers typically operate in verticals such as higher education, healthcare, government (federal, state, local, and education), manufacturing, hospitality, stadiums, and retail. These customers often struggle with constrained resources, talent and skill gaps, and rising operational costs, while also navigating a crowded network infrastructure vendor landscape and ambiguity around emerging technologies like AI.

Within the Ethernet Switching and WLAN markets which Extreme serves, we categorize customers into three primary groups based on scale and infrastructure needs:

1.
Mid-market customers
—typically with 500 to 999 employees, are regional or national in scope and possess moderate IT complexity and budgets. This segment represents an estimated TAM of $10 billion in 2025.  
2.
Enterprise customers
—defined as companies with 1,000 or more employees—operate global-scale infrastructures and require advanced security and compliance capabilities, representing a TAM of approximately $22 billion in 2025.  
3.
Service providers
—which include organizations delivering voice, data, or internet services to consumers and businesses, vary widely in sizes. This segment accounts for a TAM of approximately $2 billion in 2025.  
These classifications enable the company to tailor its go-to-market strategies and product offerings to better meet the distinct

9

needs of each segment.

From a network infrastructure standpoint, these types of organizations require robust networking solutions within the data center, as well as access and edge switching. These same customers are deploying enterprise-wide or campus Wi-Fi solutions. Security is a pervasive concern, and many are implementing ZTNA technology to secure their end-to-end network. They are also seeking solutions that make deployment and on-going management of the network not only secure but easier, smarter and more intuitive, thus they are seeking solutions including data center fabric automation, cloud/hybrid network management, and SD-WAN. Their IT environments are often a mix of legacy and modern systems, and they seek integrated, scalable solutions to simplify operations and enhance security.

 The typical decision-makers within these organizations include CIOs, VPs of IT, Directors of Infrastructure, Network Architects, CISOs, CFOs, and IT procurement specialists. Their top priorities revolve around reducing cost, risk, and complexity, achieving operational excellence, improving security posture, ensuring uptime, and maintaining compliance. These customers range from cloud-curious to cloud-mature and are actively exploring AI and automation to drive innovation and efficiency.

Customers with 10% of net revenues or greater
See Note 3, 
Revenues
, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our customers providing 10% or more of our net revenues.
International sales
International sales are an important portion of our business. In fiscal 2025, sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 52% of our consolidated net revenues, compared to 48% in fiscal 2024, and 56% in fiscal 2023. These sales are conducted primarily through foreign-based distributors and resellers managed by our worldwide sales organization. In addition, we have direct sales to end-user customers, including large global accounts. The primary markets for sales outside of the United States are countries in Europe and Asia, as well as Canada, Mexico, Central America and South America.

We operate in one segment, the development and marketing of network infrastructure equipment and related software. Information concerning revenues, results of operations and revenues by geographic area is set forth under Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Information on risks attendant to our foreign operations is set forth below in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”

Marketing
We continue to develop and execute a number of marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of our products by communicating the value of our solutions to our existing and potential customers, our distribution channels, our resellers and our technology alliance partners. Our marketing efforts include participation in industry tradeshows, conferences and seminars, publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals, communication across social media channels, frequent updates to our publicly available website, promotions, web-based training courses, advertising, analyst relations and public relations. We also submit our products for independent product testing and evaluation. Extreme participates in numerous industry analyst recognitions and placements including Gartner Magic Quadrants, Gartner Critical Capabilities, Gartner Peer Insights, Gartner Customer Choice, Forrester Waves and IDC MarketScapes.
Backlog
Our products are sold based on standard purchase orders and backlog represents confirmed orders with a purchase order for products to be fulfilled and billed to customers with approved credit status. Actual shipments of products depend on the then-current capacity of our contract manufacturers and the availability of materials and components from our vendors. Although, we believe the orders included in the backlog are firm, all orders are subject to possible rescheduling by customers, and cancellations by customers, which we may elect to allow on an exception basis. Therefore, we do not believe our backlog, as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual revenues for any future period.
Our product backlog at June 30, 2025, net of anticipated back-end rebates for distributor sales, was $72.3 million, compared to $64.0 million at June 30, 2024.

Seasonality
Like many of our competitors, we historically have experienced seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns, which generally adversely affect our first and third fiscal quarters. This pattern should not be relied upon or be considered indicative of our future performance, as it has varied in the past.
Manufacturing
We utilize a global sourcing strategy that emphasizes procurement of materials and product manufacturing in competitive geographies. However, this strategy continues to face challenges from global supply chain disruptions, trade policy changes, and tariff uncertainties that impact cost, availability, and delivery timelines. We rely upon original design manufacturers (“ODM”), such as Alpha

10

Networks, Inc., Lite-On Technology Corporation, Quanta Computer Inc., Senao Networks, Inc., Sercomm Corporation and Wistron Neweb Corporation to manufacture, support and ship our products, and therefore are exposed to risks associated with their businesses, financial condition, and geopolitical conflict in geographies in which they operate. Our arrangements with these manufacturing partners generally provide for quality, cost, and delivery requirements, as well as manufacturing process terms, such as continuity of supply; inventory management; flexible capacity, quality, and cost management; oversight of manufacturing; and conditions for use of our intellectual property that allow us to adjust more quickly to changing end-customer demand. We also leverage and depend on the strong Environmental, Social and Governance policies and standards of our manufacturing partners. The ODM manufacturing process uses automated testing equipment and burn-in procedures, as well as comprehensive inspection, testing, and statistical process controls, which are designed to help ensure the quality and reliability of our products. To mitigate security risks associated with conducting business across our interconnected supply chain we have a 
Supply Chain and Information Security Policy
 and related procedures for communicating our requirements to suppliers and conducting annual compliance assessments. Additionally, we have launched new product features such as Secure Boot, which are being designed to provide additional integrity assurance of the firmware and software running on our hardware platform by establishing an encrypted key-based chain-of-trust relationship in the boot process. The manufacturing processes and procedures are generally certified to International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 9001 standards. The manufacturing process and material supply chains are flexible enough to allow us to mitigate, at least in part, risks arising from geopolitical conflicts that impact cost and delivery.
We use a collaborative sales and operations planning forecast of expected demand based upon historical trends and analyses from our Sales and Product Management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions. Demand Planning, Supply Operations and our Distributors work closely using a ‘continuous planning’ methodology as part of our Sales and Operations Execution process to determine and position our material requirements to support customer demand. Our manufacturing partners procure the components needed to build our products based on our demand forecasts that cover material lead times. This allows us to leverage the expertise and purchasing power of our manufacturing partners. Our products rely on key components, including merchant silicon, integrated circuit components and power supplies purchased from a limited number of suppliers, including certain sole source providers. Lead times for materials and components vary significantly, and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, technology, complexity, contract terms, demand and availability for a component at a given time. From time to time, we may experience price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are either sourced from a limited number of qualified suppliers or concentrated in specific geographic regions. While supply chain conditions have improved over the past year, risks remain
—
tariffs, trade disruptions, and fluctuating component lead-times continue to impact the broader supply ecosystem. We continue to learn from the evolving global supply chain and build upon innovative strategies to enhance resilience and agility into our supply chain. Utilizing technology brought forward from our ongoing Digital Transformation project, which has entailed integrating digital technology into all areas of our business, changing how we operate and deliver value to customers. In this case, new systems and processes have given us better visibility and control over inventory. Collaborative partnerships with our ODMs and diversified sourcing strategies have also emerged, fostering greater flexibility and risk mitigation. Our product development efforts also depend upon continued collaboration with our key suppliers, including our merchant silicon vendors such as Broadcom. As we develop our product roadmap and continue to expand our relationships with these and other merchant silicon vendors, it is critical that we work in tandem with our key vendors to ensure that their silicon includes improved features and that our products take advantage of such improved features. Further information on risks relating to our inventory forecasting and supply chain is set forth below in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
We believe our sourcing and manufacturing strategy allows us to adjust quickly to changes in market demand, working with our ODM suppliers and developing direct relationships with key component suppliers to support the backlog. We continue to focus on optimizing product availability through multi-sourcing, visibility and control of key supply lines, rationalizing our supply chain, outsourcing or virtualizing certain activities, and consolidating distribution sites and service logistics partners. These efforts also include process optimization initiatives, such as vendor managed inventory, and other operational models and strategies designed to drive improved efficiencies in our sourcing, production, logistics and fulfillment.

Research and Development
The success of our products to date is due in large part to our focus on research and development. We believe that continued success in the marketplace relies on our ability to regularly bring to the market new and enhanced products employing leading-edge technology that provide business solutions affordably, securely, and effortlessly. Accordingly, we are undertaking development efforts with an emphasis on increasing the scalability, reliability, usability, and security while innovating our user and buyer experience reducing complexity and the overall network operating costs of customers.
Our product research and development activities focus on solving the needs of customers in the enterprise campus edge and core by providing a unified wired, wireless, and SD-WAN cloud-driven network, enabling secure access from edge to public, hybrid, or private clouds in targeted verticals. Current activities include the continuing development of our innovative switching technology aimed at giving our customers flexibility in how they deploy, connect to the cloud, monitor, and configure instantly saving time and money. Our ongoing research activities cover a broad range of areas, including cloud native technologies and solutions, generative AI, agentic AI, network security, identity management, wired and wireless networking, switching, and routing, open standards interfaces, software defined networks, campus, and data center fabrics. In addition, we continue to invest in ML/AI technology solutions targeting self-healing autonomous networking, Cloud Wi-Fi, IoT anomaly detection, and user recommendations.
We continue to enhance the functionality of our network operating systems which have been designed to provide high reliability, scale, and availability. This allows us to leverage a common operating system across different hardware and network chipsets.
As of June 30, 2025, our research and development organization consisted of 1,045 employees. Research and development efforts are conducted in several of our locations, including Morrisville, North Carolina; San Jose, California; Salem, New Hampshire; Toronto, Canada; Hangzhou, China; and Bangalore and Chennai, India.

Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. As of June 30, 2025, we had 644 issued patents in the United States and 411 patents outside of the United States. The expiration dates of our issued patents in the United States range from calendar years 2025 to 2043. Although we have patent applications pending, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. As of June 30, 2025, we had 41 registered trademarks in the United States and 326 registered trademarks outside of the United States.
We enter into confidentiality, inventions assignment or license agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties with whom we do business, and control access to, and distribution of, our software, documentation and other proprietary information. In addition, we provide our software products to end-user customers primarily under “clickwrap” license agreements. These agreements are not negotiated with or signed by the licensee, and thus these agreements may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States.
Competition
The market for network switches, routers and software (including analytics) which is part of the broader market for networking equipment, is extremely competitive and characterized by rapid technological progress, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. We believe the principal competitive factors in this market are:
•
expertise and familiarity with network protocols, network switching/routing/wireless and network management;
•
robust, cloud-driven options that reduce the cost of acquisition, provisioning, and ongoing management of network management;
•
expertise and familiarity with application analytics software;
•
expertise with network operations and management software;
•
expertise in machine learning and artificial intelligence;
•
product performance, features, functionality and reliability;
•
price/performance characteristics;
•
timeliness of new product introductions;
•
adoption of emerging industry standards;
•
customer service and support;
•
size and scope of distribution network;

12

•
brand name;
•
breadth of product offering;
•
access to customers; and
•
size of installed customer base.
We believe we compete with our competitors with respect to many of the foregoing factors. However, the market for network switching solutions is dominated by a few large companies, particularly Cisco Systems, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., and prior to the recent merger with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company, Juniper Networks Inc. To a lesser extent, Extreme competes with products and solutions from Arista Networks Inc., CommScope Holding Company, Inc., Fortinet, Inc., and Ubiquiti Inc. Most of these competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, broader product lines and substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources.
We expect to face increased competition from both traditional networking solutions companies and cloud platform companies offering Infrastructure-as-a-Service (“IaaS”) and Platform-as-a-Service (“PaaS”) products to enterprise customers. In that regard, we expect to face increased competition from certain cloud computing companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google providing a cloud-based platform of data center compute and networking services for enterprise customers.
We believe Extreme is uniquely positioned to address its overarching vision of the future, the Infinite Enterprise, with its bet on industry-leading cloud solutions, automation and AI. Although we believe that our solutions and strategy will improve our ability to meet the needs of our current and potential customers, we cannot guarantee future success.
Restructuring and Impairment

Fiscal year 2025
During fiscal 2025, the Company continued to execute the restructuring plans initiated in prior years.
Fiscal year 2024
During fiscal year 2024, the Company initiated various restructuring plans, including the “Q1 2024”, “Q2 2024”, and “Q3 2024” Plans, to reorganize and rebalance the workforce to create greater efficiency and improve execution, in alignment with the Company's business and strategic priorities, reduce its ongoing operating expenses, and focus its sales and marketing efforts on specific geographies and industry segments with higher growth opportunities. The Q1 2024 Plan was completed in fiscal year 2024.
Fiscal year 2023
During fiscal year 2023, the Company initiated a restructuring plan to transform our business infrastructure and reduce our facilities footprint and the facilities related charges (the “2023 Plan”). As part of this project the Company moved engineering labs from its San Jose, California location to its Salem, New Hampshire location. This move is expected to help reduce the cost of operating our labs. The Company expects to complete the 2023 Plan by the end of fiscal year 2026.
We are subject to various environmental and other regulations governing product safety, materials usage, packaging and other environmental impacts in the United States and in various countries where our products are manufactured and sold. We are also subject to regulatory developments, including SEC disclosure regulations relating to so-called "conflict minerals," relating to ethically responsible sourcing of the components and materials used in our products. To date, compliance with federal, state, local, and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has had no material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
We are committed to improving energy efficiency in our product lines. Accordingly, we believe this is an area that affords us a competitive advantage for our products in the marketplace. We maintain compliance with various regulations related to the environment, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment and the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment regulations adopted by the European Union. To date, our compliance efforts with various United States and foreign regulations related to the environment have not had a material effect on our operating results.

Human Capital

At Extreme, we manage our human capital guided by our core values of Candor, Transparency, Curiosity, Teamwork, Ownership, and Inclusion. We apply these principles to talent acquisition and management, compensation and benefits, and inclusion and engagement.
As of June 30, 2025, we employed 2,811 people. Of these, 30.8% work in sales and marketing, 37.1% in research and development, 5.2% in operations, 15.2% in customer support and services and 11.7% in finance and administration. These employees were located worldwide, with 43.1% located in the United States, 8.9% in other locations in the Americas, 31.6% in the Asia Pacific region (“APAC”), which includes India, and 16.4% in the regions of Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”).
None of our U.S. employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. In certain foreign jurisdictions, where required by local law or customs, some of our employees are represented by local workers’ councils and/or industry collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good, and we have not experienced any work stoppages due to labor disagreements.
Talent Acquisition and Development.
 We strive to attract and retain the most qualified employees for each role within the Company. We on-board new employees through the New Hire Academy and encourage skill development throughout the employee journey utilizing various role-specific training programs, career development tools, manager training, coaching, and mentorship. We continue to develop our employees, for example, by providing a subscription to LinkedIn Learning for all employees. We provide regular feedback to our employees with performance management reviews.
Compensation and Benefits.
 Our compensation philosophy is to offer a competitive compensation package designed to reward achievement of the Company’s goals. Our short-term bonus plan is designed to motivate employees to meet half-year goals, and our employee stock purchase plan and grants of restricted stock units to eligible employees reward longer-term stock price appreciation. Our U.S. benefits plan includes health benefits, life and disability insurance, various voluntary insurances, flexible time off and leave programs, an employee assistance plan, an educational assistance policy, and a 401(k) plan with a competitive employer match. Our international benefits plans are competitive locally and generally provide similar benefits.
Inclusion and Engagement. 
We believe we gain valuable perspective that drives better decision making when we include all voices. To foster an inclusive environment, we support several employee-led employee resource groups, including Abilities Alliance (employees with disabilities), API (Asian Pacific Islanders), APEX (Aspiring Professionals @ Extreme), Black @ Extreme (Black/African American), LaRaza (Hispanic), Maitri (employees in India), Parents at Extreme Networks, Pride Alliance (LGBTQ+), Veterans Council, and Women in Networking. Our employee resource groups are open to all and provide regular programming to create connections between employees and enhance engagement within Extreme. To further build employee engagement, we request feedback from employees through our annual ECHO (Employees Communicate Honest Opinions) survey, an avenue for leadership to listen and then take action based on the feedback received. We also promote an open door policy and encourage employees to provide feedback to leadership on an informal basis.
Organization
We were incorporated in California in May 1996 and reincorporated in Delaware in March 1999. Our corporate headquarters are located at 2121 RDU Center Drive, Suite 300, Morrisville, NC 27560 and our telephone number is (408) 579-2800. We electronically file our Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) disclosure reports with the SEC and they are available free of charge at both www.sec.gov and www.extremenetworks.com.
Our corporate governance guidelines, the charters of our Audit Committee, our Compensation Committee, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics policy (including code of ethics provisions that apply to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, controller and senior financial officers) are available on the Investors section of our website at investor.extremenetworks.com under “Governance.” These items are also available to any stockholder who requests them by calling (408) 579-2800.

Item 1A.

Ri
sk Factors

We face a number of risks and uncertainties which may have a material and adverse effect on our business, operations, industry, financial condition, operating results or future financial performance. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and future financial performance.
Risks Related to Our Business, Operations, and Industry
Geopolitical changes are creating uncertainty regarding economic and trade matters, potentially leading to adverse general economic conditions that may adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operating results.
The ongoing unpredictability of U.S. economic policies including recent tariff adjustments, as well as broader geopolitical tensions, continue to create significant uncertainty in the world economy, including a risk of inflation. Potential impacts of these policies and tensions could include decreased demand for our products, increased costs to us, supply chain limitations, and volatility of our stock price.

A substantial portion of our business depends on the demand for enterprise-scale networking, which, in turn, is impacted by the overall economic health of our current and prospective end-customers. Volatility in the global economic market or other global or regional economic uncertainty, inflation, interest rate fluctuations, foreign exchange instability, limited availability of credit, a reduction in business confidence and activity, reductions in government spending, and other difficulties may affect one or more of the industries to which we sell our products and services. If economic conditions continue to be uncertain, many existing and prospective end-customers may delay or reduce their IT spending. This could result in reductions in sales of our products and services, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies, and increased price competition.

While we have diversified our manufacturing presence and limited our reliance on imports from China, tariffs have been imposed and threaten to be increased on other countries where our products are manufactured, such as Taiwan, Vietnam, and the Philippines. A majority of our products are currently excluded from the bulk of these tariffs, though we cannot predict that will continue to be the case. Any imposition of tariffs or imposition of new export controls assessed on importation of our products to the United States may result in increased costs and potential delays.
Additionally, global trade partners may continue to respond to U.S. tariffs with retaliatory measures. For instance, China has, in the past, made threats of restricting exports of critical raw materials, including rare earth minerals essential to several of our components. Such actions could disrupt our supply chain, elevate input costs, create delays as alternative suppliers are sought, and undermine the competitiveness of our offerings. Similarly, other countries could impose retaliatory tariffs against American imports, which could potentially increase the cost of our products to customers in those countries, making our products less competitive.
We are actively monitoring these evolving trade dynamics and are implementing diversification and supply chain resilience strategies to mitigate potential disruptions. This includes exploring alternative sourcing options and reassessing geographic risk in our manufacturing and logistics footprint.
The continued uncertainty around U.S. tariff and economic policies and broader geopolitical tensions is contributing to market volatility, which has impacted the Company’s stock price, and is likely to continue to do so. In addition, if tariffs are set that materially impact the Company’s financial results, the Company’s stock price could be negatively impacted.
Any one of these impacts, or the aggregate impact of them, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
Intense competition and consolidation in the market for networking equipment and management solutions could prevent us from increasing revenues.
The market for network switching and management solutions is intensely competitive and dominated primarily by Cisco Systems Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., and, prior to the recent merger with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company, Juniper Networks, Inc. To a lesser extent, Extreme competes with products and solutions from Arista Networks, Inc., CommScope Holding Company, Inc., Fortinet, Inc., and Ubiquiti Inc. Most of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, broader product lines and substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources. As a result, these competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, sale and support of their products. In addition, they have larger distribution channels, stronger brand names, access to more customers, a larger installed customer base, and a greater ability to make attractive offers to channel partners and customers than we do. Further, many of our competitors have made substantial investments in hardware networking capabilities and offerings as well as software and AI functionality to run and manage the networks. These competitors may be able to gain market share by leveraging their investments to attract customers at lower prices or with greater synergies.

15

The pricing policies of our competitors impact the overall demand for our products and services. Some of our competitors are capable of operating at significant losses for extended periods of time or otherwise offer competitive products at lower prices, increasing pricing pressure on our products and services. If we do not maintain competitive pricing, the demand for our products and services, as well as our market share, may decline. From time to time, we may lower the prices of our products and services in response to competitive pressure. When this happens, if we are unable to reduce our component costs or improve operating efficiencies, our revenues and gross margins will be adversely affected.
There has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years, and we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations. As competitors merge or acquire additional lines of business, their expanded resources may make competition more difficult. For example, while we see opportunity to grow our market share in the wake of the Hewlett-Packard Enterprise Company and Juniper Networks, Inc. merger, it is uncertain that we will be able to capitalize on this opportunity. If we fail to do so, we could lose market share to them or other competitors.

In addition, companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. We believe industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole-source vendors for customers. This could lead to a loss of market share and revenue for us. Furthermore, particularly in the service provider market, rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers, with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants.
We may also face increased competition from traditional networking solutions companies, companies in adjacent industries such as information security moving into networking, and cloud hyperscalers offering Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service products to enterprise customers. In particular, AWS, Microsoft Azure, and GCP may provide enterprise customers with a cloud-based platform of data center computing and networking services that could compete with our services and adversely impact our market share and revenue.
One of our key differentiators is the quality of our support and services. Our failure to continue to provide high-quality support and services could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and future growth prospects.
Supply chain issues such as concentration of suppliers and manufacturing partners, supplier disruptions, shipping delays, material or components shortages, quality control, regulatory impacts, and inability to reduce manufacturing costs could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.
We primarily rely on our manufacturing partners Alpha Networks, Inc, Senao Networks, Inc., Wistron Neweb Corporation, Sercomm Corporation, Quanta Computer Inc, Lite-On Technology Corp, and select other partners to manufacture our products. In addition, we currently purchase some key components used in the manufacturing of our products from single or limited sources and are dependent upon supply from these sources to meet our needs. Our top six suppliers accounted for a significant portion of our purchases during the year. Given the concentration of our supply chain, particularly with certain sole or limited source providers, any significant disruption to any of the key suppliers or a termination of a relationship could temporarily impact our operations and our ability to meet customer orders.
Such disruptions could be caused by natural disasters, public health emergencies such as pandemics, business interruption related to financial or operational factors, cyberattacks, geopolitical events such as the threat of political or military actions, including between China and Taiwan, energy constraints, regulatory constraints, labor or raw materials shortages, quality issues, transportation or shipping delays, tariffs or other trade restrictions, or other events. We have experienced in the past, and continue to experience, challenges obtaining components such as semiconductor chips due to high demand or limited supply. Currently, some vendors are shifting allocation of raw materials and resources from producing enterprise-grade components to producing components for more advanced technology. For example, Samsung has ceased production of certain memory chips to focus on higher end chips. These disruptions could result in sustained lead-times, higher overall costs, extra delivery costs for expedited shipments, and shortages and allocations of certain components, resulting in delays in filling orders or even delayed product introductions. Additional factors that may impact costs and availability of product include energy, raw material, and transportation costs.

While we maintain strong relationships with our manufacturing partners and suppliers, our agreements with them are generally of limited duration and pricing, quality, and volume commitments are negotiated on a recurring basis. Manufacturing partners and suppliers may be unable or unwilling to renew agreements with consistent terms, and could materially increase prices (including increases related to inflationary pressures) or reduce quantity, quality, volume, or service level standards. We may not be able to pass along increased costs to our customers, which could negatively impact gross margin. Reductions in quantity or quality of finished product could decrease the amount of product for sale and could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.

Additionally, our operations are materially dependent upon the continued market acceptance and quality of these manufacturers’ products and their ability to continue to manufacture products that are competitive and comply with laws or our requirements relating to environmental and efficiency standards. Our inability to obtain products from one or more of these suppliers or a decline in market acceptance of these suppliers’ products could harm our reputation and make our products less competitive.

16

As part of our cost-reduction efforts, we will need to realize lower per unit product costs from our manufacturing partners by means of volume efficiencies and the utilization of manufacturing sites in lower-cost geographies. However, we cannot be certain when or if such price reductions will occur, particularly in light of supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. The failure to obtain such price reductions would materially adversely affect our gross margin and operating results.
We have been impacted in the past, and will likely continue to be impacted by, tariffs put into place by the United States or by other countries. We have worked to mitigate this impact by moving manufacturing operations out of China to other countries. However, new tariffs have been imposed and could potentially increase on goods from countries to which we have moved production. Imposition of tariffs is likely to increase our costs, having a negative impact on our gross margin and operating results.
Qualifying new suppliers to compensate for such shortages, delays, poor quality, increased costs, or other concerns may be time-consuming and costly and may increase the likelihood of errors in design or production as replacement suppliers may not meet the quality requirements of our customers, resulting in harm to our reputation and making our products less competitive.
The Company actively works to reduce exposure to supply chain issues such as these, but is unable to completely eliminate them. If we are unable to mitigate these effects, this could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and future financial performance.
System security risks, data breaches, and cyberattacks could compromise our proprietary information, disrupt our internal operations, impact services to customers, and harm public perception of our products, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and future growth prospects.
In the ordinary course of business using systems that we own and manage, we provide cloud-based services and store data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners on our networks. In addition, we store information through cloud-based services that may be hosted by third parties and in data center infrastructure maintained by third parties. The secure provision of services and maintenance of this information and our IT systems is critical to our operations and business strategy.
We face numerous and evolving cybersecurity risks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our IT systems and data. These threats come from diverse threat actors, such as state-sponsored organizations, opportunistic hackers and hacktivists, as well as through diverse attack vectors, such as social engineering/phishing, malware (including ransomware), technological error, and as a result of bugs, misconfigurations or exploited vulnerabilities in software or hardware, including vulnerabilities in commercial software that is integrated into our (or our suppliers’ or service providers’) IT systems, products or services. Increasingly, companies, including us, are subject to a variety of attacks on their networks and/or cloud-based services on an ongoing basis. The number of sophisticated attacks continues to increase on a global scale in frequency and magnitude, and with the availability to bad actors of AI to assist them in perpetrating these attacks, we expect the speed and complexity of these attacks to continue to escalate. Attacks could include supply chain attacks targeting our suppliers and attempts to penetrate our systems or disrupt our services directly. In some cases, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain vulnerabilities in design or manufacture that could allow network intrusion or unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our systems, products or services we provide to customers. Usage of “legacy” products that have been determined to have reached an end-of-life engineering status but will continue to operate for a limited amount of time may subject us or our customers to vulnerabilities. Further, employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions can result in a security or data breach.
Despite our security measures, we may not be able to effectively detect, prevent, or protect against or otherwise mitigate losses from all cyberattacks or prevent all security or data breaches. There can also be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls, or procedures, will be fully implemented, complied with, or effective in protecting our IT systems and data. Because the techniques and tools used by bad actors, many of whom are highly sophisticated and well-funded, to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until after they are used, we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect and remediate these techniques. Any such breach could compromise our networks, products, or cloud-based services by creating system disruptions, slowdowns or even shutdowns, and exploiting security vulnerabilities of our products, services, and the information stored as part of our operations could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Additionally, because our products and services are integrated with our customers’ systems and processes, any circumvention or failure of our cybersecurity defenses or measures could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our customers’ own IT systems and/or our customers’ proprietary or other sensitive information.
Any adverse impact to the availability, integrity or confidentiality of our IT systems, including any actual or perceived breach of network security occurs in our products, network, or in the network of a customer of our networking products, regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products, the market perception of the effectiveness or security of our products could be harmed. This could impede our sales efforts and impact our market share and future revenue. Such events require significant management attention and resources, impacting our expenses and resources available to commit to other efforts. In addition, the economic costs to us to eliminate, mitigate, or recover from, or remediate cyber or other security problems, such as bugs, viruses, worms, ransomware or other malware, and security vulnerabilities could be significant and may be difficult to anticipate or measure. Further, this could result in legal claims or proceedings (such as class actions), regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, fines and penalties. We cannot guarantee that

17

any costs and liabilities incurred in relation to an attack or incident will be covered by our existing insurance policies or that applicable insurance will be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all. Any or all of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
If we fail to anticipate technological shifts, market needs and opportunities, and fail to develop products, product enhancements and business strategies that meet those technological shifts, needs and opportunities in a timely manner or if they do not gain market acceptance, we may not be able to compete effectively and our ability to generate revenues will suffer.
The markets for our products are constantly evolving and characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions, changes in customer requirements, evolving industry standards, and continuous pricing pressures.
For example, cloud-based network management is the fastest growing segment of the networking industry. Our success may be impacted by our ability to provide successful cloud networking solutions that address the needs of our customers more effectively and economically than those of other competitors or existing technologies. If the cloud networking solutions market does not develop in the way we anticipate, if our solutions do not offer significant benefits compared to competing legacy products, or if end customers do not recognize the benefits that our solutions provide, then our potential for growth in this cloud-based network management segment could be adversely affected. If we are unsuccessful in attaching cloud services and maintenance services to our hardware product, our ability to grow our subscription revenue could be limited. If we are unsuccessful in integrating AI into the functionality of our products and achieving customer adoption of our AI-integrated platform, our revenue growth could be limited.
When we announce new products or product enhancements that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing products, customers may defer or cancel orders for our existing products; in addition, ending sales of existing products may cause customers to cancel or defer orders for our existing products. These actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by unexpectedly decreasing sales, increasing inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence.
We cannot guarantee that we will be able to anticipate future technological shifts, market needs and opportunities or be able to develop new products, product enhancements and business strategies to meet such technological shifts, needs or opportunities in a timely manner or at all.  If we fail to anticipate market requirements or opportunities or fail to develop and introduce new products, product enhancements or business strategies to meet those requirements or opportunities in a timely manner, it could cause us to lose customers, and such failure could substantially decrease or delay market acceptance and sales of our present and future products and services. Even if we are able to anticipate, develop, and commercially introduce new products and enhancements, we cannot assure that new products or enhancements will achieve widespread market acceptance. Any or all of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.

We depend upon international sales for a significant portion of our revenues, which imposes a number of risks on our business.
International sales constitute a significant portion of our net revenues. Our ability to grow will depend in part on the expansion of international sales. There are a number of risks arising from our international business, including:
•
the payment of operating expenses in local currencies, which exposes us to risks of currency fluctuations;
•
fluctuations in local economies which impact demand;
•
import tariffs imposed by the United States and the possibility of reciprocal tariffs by foreign countries;
•
compliance with trade compliance laws and regulations, including restrictions on trade with embargoed or sanctioned countries or with denied parties, and rules related to the export of encryption technology;
•
differing privacy regulations, data localization requirements, and restrictions on cross-border data transfers;
•
compliance with U.S. laws and regulations pertaining to the sale and distribution of products to customers in foreign countries, including anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010;
•
compliance with regulatory requirements of foreign countries, including compliance with rapidly evolving environmental regulations;
•
difficulty in conducting due diligence with respect to business partners in certain international markets;
•
reduced or limited protection of intellectual property rights, particularly in jurisdictions that have less developed intellectual property regimes, such as China and India;
•
difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas;
•
longer accounts receivable collection cycles;
•
higher credit risks requiring cash in advance or letters of credit;
•
potential adverse tax consequences;
•
increased complexity of accounting rules and financial reporting requirements;
•
difficulties associated with enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems;
•
systemic transportation issues could impact delivery of product around the world;
•
terrorism, war or other armed conflict; and
•
natural disasters, epidemics, and pandemics.

18

Any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
Substantially all of our international sales are U.S. Dollar-denominated. The recent weakness of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies could have the effect of increasing our operating expenses, which are often paid in local currency. In the future, we may elect to invoice a larger portion of our international customers in local currency, which would expose us to greater fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. Dollar and the particular local currency. If we do so, we may decide to engage in hedging transactions to minimize the risk of such fluctuations. We have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the impact of payment of operating expenses in local currencies to some of our operating foreign subsidiaries. However, if we are not successful in managing these foreign currency transactions, we could incur losses from these activities.
If we are not able to effectively forecast demand or manage our inventory, we may be required to record write-downs for excess or obsolete inventory.
We maintain sufficient inventory of finished goods and, to a lesser extent, raw materials and drive demand with our third-party manufacturers in amounts that we believe allow for timely fulfillment of sales. We estimate required levels of inventory based on current and anticipated demand, market conditions, and product development cycles. Our estimates are also based on inventory levels and sales data from our distributors, which are not always reliable or timely. The actual levels of inventory are subject to the impact of external factors such as supply shortages, macroeconomic conditions, technology shifts, or price changes. Distributors may increase or decrease the levels of inventory that they order to meet supply shortages or expected demand. If distributors increase orders to build up stock out of concern for product shortages, or to meet anticipated demand that does not materialize, we may have excess channel inventory, leading to reductions in future period orders from our distributors.
If we incorrectly forecast demand, we may build up excess inventory. Higher levels of inventory expose us to a greater risk of carrying excess or obsolete inventory, which may in turn lead to write-downs. We may also record write-downs in connection with the end-of-life for specific products in our inventory, as we did in the fourth quarter of 2024, when we recorded additional reserves due to certain excess and obsolete inventory. However, if we have insufficient inventory, we risk not being able to maximize sales, thus negatively impacting revenue and could impair our distributor relationships, potentially jeopardizing our ability to build revenue in the future.

We enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers based on our anticipated demand, market conditions, and product development cycles. These contracts obligate us to purchase commitments for raw materials and finished goods. If demand for our products is lower than expected, we may be obligated to purchase excess product or raw materials from our suppliers, resulting in an adverse impact on our cash flows, operating expenses, financial condition, and operating results. For example, we have, in the past, recorded significant charges due to excess inventory and such commitments to our suppliers.
Failure to accurately forecast demand has in the past, and could, in the future, require us to write-off the value of excess products or components inventory, causing our financial performance to suffer. If we are unable to manage our inventory or commitments to suppliers in the future, we could be required to record additional charges. Any or all of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
To successfully manage our business or achieve our goals, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and promote key employees, and a failure to do so can harm us.
Our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management, engineering, sales and marketing, service, finance, and operations personnel, many of whom would be difficult to replace. We have experienced and may in the future experience significant turnover in our executive personnel. Changes in our management and key employees could affect our financial results, and our prior reductions in force may impede our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. We believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial, engineering, sales and marketing, service, finance, and operations personnel. The market for such personnel is competitive in certain regions for certain types of technical skills, particularly AI.
A number of our employees are foreign nationals who rely on visas and entry permits to legally work in the United States and other countries. Changes in immigration laws and enforcement could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to attract and retain skilled professionals. Any of these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, and operating results.
We rely on third-party providers for services needed to deliver our cloud solutions and other third-party providers for our internal operations. Any disruption in the services provided by such third-party providers could adversely affect our business and subject us to liability.
Our cloud solutions are hosted from and use computing infrastructure provided by third parties, including AWS, GCP, and Azure. We do not own or control the operation of the third-party facilities or equipment used to provide the cloud services. Our computing infrastructure service providers have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or if one of our computing infrastructure service providers is

19

acquired, we may be required to transition to a new provider and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so. In addition, such service providers could decide to close their facilities or change or suspend their service offerings without adequate notice to us. Moreover, any financial difficulties, such as bankruptcy, faced by such service providers may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict.
If these third-party service providers experience service outages, performance problems or errors, this could adversely affect the experience of our customers. Our agreements with third-party computing infrastructure service providers may not entitle us to corresponding service level credits to those we offer to our customers. Any changes in third-party service levels at our computing infrastructure service providers or any related disruptions or performance problems with our solutions could adversely affect our reputation and impact our customers’ operations, result in lengthy interruptions in our services, or result in potential losses of customer data. Interruptions in our services might reduce our revenues, cause us to issue refunds to customers for prepaid and unused subscriptions, subject us to service level credit claims and potential liability, or adversely affect our renewal rates.
Additionally, if a third-party service provider fails to maintain compliance with standards such as SOC2 or ISO27001, it could affect the underlying controls that we maintain, or that our customers rely upon. This could entail additional costs to compensate for the lost controls, or have a negative impact on revenue if our customers do not perceive our vendors as secure.
We rely on third-party cloud service providers such as Salesforce and Oracle to support internal operations. Disruptions to such services or data breaches related to those services could impact our ability to maintain efficient operations and to provide services to our customers, could put our employees’ or customers’ data at risk, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and future growth prospects.
The adoption, use, and development of AI products may result in reputational harm or liability.
We incorporate artificial intelligence into various products that we offer, and we continue to develop additional use cases and products utilizing AI. The field of AI is rapidly developing, both technologically and from a regulatory and legal standpoint. Known challenges such as algorithmic bias, black box training sets, and “hallucinations” exist, as well as a dependence on the reliability of the underlying model. As we incorporate this technology into our products and our internal tools and systems, we may experience unexpected outcomes or impacts related to the technology, creating reputational, legal, and regulatory risks.
The regulatory framework for AI is rapidly evolving as many federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies have introduced or are currently considering additional laws and regulations. For example, in Europe, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (the “EU AI Act”) establishes a comprehensive, risk-based governance framework for AI in the EU market. The EU AI Act applies to companies that develop, use and/or provide AI in the EU and includes requirements around transparency, conformity assessments and monitoring, risk assessments, human oversight, security, accuracy, general purpose AI and foundation models, and fines for breach of up to 7% of worldwide annual turnover. Legislation related to AI technologies has been passed in various U.S. states. Such additional regulations may impact our ability to develop, use and commercialize AI technologies in the future.
Additionally, existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in ways that may affect our use of AI. As a result, implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and we cannot yet determine the impact future laws, regulations, standards, or market perception of their requirements may have on our business and may not always be able to anticipate how to respond to these laws or regulations.
We have instituted an internal AI Council to provide governance for our use of AI, and to help identify and mitigate risks associated with our and our vendors’ use of AI. However, we may not be able to anticipate or mitigate all risk. Any investigation or litigation related to our use of AI could have an adverse impact on our results of operations due to the associated costs and any related fines, and could also have an adverse impact on our customer relationships and ability to grow revenue.
Military actions and other geopolitical tensions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
In recent years, various military actions such as the February 2022 Russian military action in Ukraine or the October 2023 Israel-Hamas military action have occurred. Although the length, impact, and outcome of such conflicts are highly unpredictable, these conflicts and others that could arise could lead to significant market and other disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices and supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets, supply chain interruptions, political and social instability, changes in consumer or purchaser preferences as well as increases in cyberattacks and espionage.
In addition, such military actions could lead to, and have led to, expansion of sanction programs and export control restrictions imposed by the United States and other countries whose sanctions or export control programs could impact the Company's operations. These government measures could and do include export controls restricting certain exports, re-exports, transfers or releases of commodities, software, and technology to certain countries, and sanctions targeting certain officials, individuals, entities, regions, and industries in those countries, including the financial, defense, and energy sectors. Such sanctions and other measures, as well as the existing and potential further responses from military actors or allies to such sanctions, tensions, and military actions, could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and future financial performance.

20

Military or terrorist actions could impact suppliers’ ability to procure raw materials, or to finish or transport goods. As a result of such disruptions, we may experience in the future extended lead times, delays in supplier deliveries, increased transportation and component costs, and increased costs for expedited shipments. These potential supply chain disruptions may result in delayed deliveries of several key components used in the manufacturing of our products.
We regularly assess the impact of the geopolitical climate on our business, including our business partners and customers. The extent and duration of military actions, sanctions and resulting market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have substantial impact on the global economy and our business for an unknown period of time. Any of the abovementioned factors could affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. Any such disruptions may also magnify the impact of other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.
If our products do not effectively interoperate with our customers’ networks and result in cancellations and delays of installations, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.
Our products are designed to interface with our customers’ existing networks, each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors. Many of our customers’ networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved. Our products must inter-operate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products to meet our customers’ requirements. If we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers’ networks, we may need to modify our software networking solutions to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will inter-operate and scale with the existing software and hardware, which could be costly. In addition, if our products do not inter-operate with those of our customers’ networks, demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be canceled. This could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and future financial performance.
When our products contain undetected errors, we may incur significant unexpected expenses and could lose sales.
Network products frequently contain undetected errors when new products or new versions or updates of existing products are released to the marketplace. In the past, we have experienced such errors in connection with new products and product updates. We have experienced component problems in prior years that caused us to incur higher than expected warranty, service costs and expenses, and other related operating expenses. In the future, we expect that, from time to time, such errors or component failures will be found in new or existing products after the commencement of commercial shipments. These problems may have a material adverse effect on our business by causing us to incur significant warranty, repair and replacement costs, diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from new product development efforts, delaying the recognition of revenue, and causing significant customer relations problems. Further, if products are not accepted by customers due to such defects, such returns could exceed the amount we accrued for defective returns.
Our products are used in conjunction  with products from other vendors. As a result, when problems occur in a network, it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems. The occurrence of system errors, whether or not caused by our products, could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses. Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
We must continue to develop and increase the productivity of our indirect distribution channels to increase net revenues and improve our operating results.
Our distribution strategy focuses primarily on developing and increasing the productivity of our indirect distribution channels. If we fail to develop and cultivate relationships with significant channel partners, if we are unable to meet their needs, or if these channel partners are not successful in their sales efforts, sales of our products may decrease and our operating results could suffer. Many of our channel partners also sell products from other vendors that compete with our products. Our channel partners may not continue to market or sell our products effectively or to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales, marketing, and technical support. We may not be able to successfully manage our sales channels or enter into additional reseller and/or distribution agreements. Our failure to do any of these could limit our ability to grow or sustain revenues.
Our operating results for any given period have and will continue to depend to a significant extent on large orders from a relatively small number of channel partners and other customers. However, we do not have binding purchase commitments from any of them. A substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to a significant reseller, distributor or other customer could harm our business because our expense levels are based on our expectations as to future revenues and, to a large extent, are fixed in the short term. Some third-party distributors have contractual terms that allow them to return products to us and unexpected returns. Any or all of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and future financial performance.
The sales cycle for our products is long and we may incur substantial non-recoverable expenses or devote significant resources to sales that do not occur when anticipated.
The purchase of our products represents a significant strategic decision by a customer regarding its communications infrastructure. The decision by customers to purchase our products is often based on the results of a variety of internal procedures associated with the

21

evaluation, testing, implementation, and acceptance of new technologies. Accordingly, the product evaluation process frequently results in a lengthy sales cycle, typically ranging from three months to longer than a year, and as a result, our ability to sell products is subject to a number of significant risks, including risks that:
•
budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews by customers will result in the loss of potential sales;
•
there may be substantial variation in the length of the sales cycle from customer to customer, making decisions on the expenditure of resources difficult to assess;
•
we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management time in an attempt to initiate or increase the sale of products to customers, but not succeed; 
•
when a sales forecast from a specific customer for a particular quarter is not achieved in that quarter, we may be unable to compensate for the shortfall, which could harm our operating results; and
•
downward pricing pressures could occur during the lengthy sales cycle for our products.
These factors could impact our inventory forecasting and revenue forecasting, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and future financial performance.
Risks Related to Financial Matters
We cannot assure future profitability, and our financial results may fluctuate significantly from period to period.
We have not been consistently profitable. Even in years when we reported profits, we may not have been profitable in each quarter during those years. We anticipate continuing to incur significant sales and marketing, product development and general and administrative expenses. Any delay in generating or recognizing revenue could result in a loss for a quarter or full year. Even if we are profitable, our operating results may fall below guidance we provide and expectations of our investors, which could cause the price of our stock to fall.
We may experience challenges or delays in forecasting, generating or recognizing revenue for a number of reasons and our revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:
•
our dependence on obtaining orders during a quarter and shipping those orders in the same quarter;
•
orders in our backlog could be cancelled by customers;
•
decreases in the prices of the products we sell;
•
the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which products are sold;
•
acceptance provisions in customer contracts;
•
our ability to deliver installation or customer acceptance by the end of the quarter;
•
seasonal fluctuations in demand for our products and services;
•
a disproportionate percentage of our sales occurring in the last month of a quarter;
•
reduced visibility into the implementation cycles for our products and our customers’ spending plans;
•
our ability to forecast demand for our products, which in the case of lower-than-expected sales, may result in excess or obsolete inventory in addition to non-cancelable purchase commitments for component parts;
•
our sales to the telecommunications service provider market, which represents a significant source of large product orders, being especially volatile and difficult to forecast;
•
product returns or the cancellation or rescheduling of orders;
•
announcements and new product introductions by our competitors;
•
our ability to develop and support relationships with enterprise customers, service providers and other potential large customers;
•
our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole- or limited-source components for our products on a timely basis; and
•
changes in funding for customer technology purchases in our markets.
In addition to risks related to revenue, we are subject to risks related to costs, which may be influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following:
•
our ability to achieve and maintain targeted cost reductions;
•
fluctuations in warranty or other service expenses actually incurred;
•
increases in the price of the components we purchase;
•
increases in costs associated with sourcing and shipping components and finished products, including tariffs;
•
general inflationary pressures, increasing the cost of all inputs; and
•
rising interest rates, increasing the cost of borrowing.
We are subject to changes in general and specific macroeconomic conditions in the economy as a whole as well as in the networking industry, which could affect both revenue and costs. In particular, increases in interest rates could decrease demand for our products and services, as the cost and access to capital to fund large projects may be limited for certain customers.

22

Due to the foregoing and other factors, many of which are described herein, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance.
Our stock price has been volatile in the past and may significantly fluctuate in the future.
In the past, the trading price of shares of our common stock has fluctuated significantly. This could continue as we or our competitors announce new products, our results or those of our customers or competition fluctuate, conditions in the networking or semiconductor industry change, conditions in the U.S. or global economy change, or when investors change their sentiment toward stocks in the networking technology sector.
In addition, fluctuations in our stock price and our enterprise value to sales valuation may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge or day-trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stock rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction, particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis. These fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price or liquidity of our common stock.
Some companies, including ours, that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities class action lawsuits filed against them. Such suits, regardless of the merits or outcome, can result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources.

If we do not adequately manage and evolve our financial reporting and managerial systems and processes, our ability to manage and grow our business may be harmed.
Our ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with regulations requires an effective planning and management process. We need to continue improving our existing, and implement new, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls. Disruptions to our existing systems, procedures, or controls or any delay or disruption in the implementation of or the transition to new or enhanced systems, procedures, or controls, or any delay or disruption in the integration of acquired businesses, could have a significant impact on our business. Failure to properly or adequately address such issues could harm our ability to manage our business, meet our obligations to our customers, accurately forecast sales demand, manage our supply chain, record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis, or forecast future results, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
Our revenues may decline as a result of changes in public funding of educational institutions.
A significant portion of our revenues comes from sales to both public and private K-12 educational institutions. Public schools receive funding from local tax revenues, and from state and federal governments through a variety of programs, many of which seek to assist schools located in underprivileged or rural areas. The funding for a portion of our sales to U.S.-based educational institutions comes from a federal funding program known as the E-Rate program. E-Rate is a program of the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) that subsidizes the purchase of approved telecommunications, Internet access, and internal connection costs for eligible public educational institutions. The E-Rate program, its eligibility criteria, the timing and specific amount of federal funding actually available and which Wi-Fi infrastructure and product sectors will benefit, are uncertain and subject to final federal program approval and funding appropriation continues to be under review by the FCC, and we cannot assure that this program or its equivalent will continue, and as a result, our business may be harmed. Furthermore, if state or local funding of public education is significantly reduced because of legislative or policy changes or by reductions in tax revenues due to changing economic conditions, our sales to educational institutions may be negatively impacted by these changed conditions. Any reduction in spending on information technology systems by educational institutions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and future financial performance.
Our credit facilities impose financial and operating restrictions on us and if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under our 2023 Credit Agreement, as amended (as defined in Item 7, “Liquidity and Capital Resources”), the lenders under such 2023 Credit Agreement could foreclose on, and acquire control of, substantially all of our assets.
Our 2023 Credit Agreement imposes, and the terms of any future debt may impose, operating and other restrictions on us. These restrictions could affect, and in many respects limit or prohibit, among other items, our ability to:
•
incur additional indebtedness;
•
create liens;
•
make investments;
•
enter into transactions with affiliates;
•
sell assets;
•
guarantee indebtedness;
•
declare or pay dividends or other distributions to stockholders;
•
repurchase equity interests;
•
change the nature of our business;
•
enter into swap agreements;

23

•
issue or sell capital stock of certain of our subsidiaries; and
•
consolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.
Our 2023 Credit Agreement also requires us to achieve and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. A breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios or metrics could result in a default under our 2023 Credit Agreement. The lenders under our 2023 Credit Agreement also have the right in the event of a breach of the restrictive covenants to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. Reductions in earnings could increase our costs of borrowing, reduce our ability to comply with these covenants, or make extensions of credit unavailable to us.
Further, our 2023 Credit Agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries. Borrowings under our 2023 Credit Agreement are secured by liens on substantially all of our assets, including the capital stock of certain of our subsidiaries, and the assets of our subsidiaries that are loan party guarantors. If we are unable to 	repay outstanding borrowings when due or comply with other obligations and covenants under our 2023 Credit Agreement, the lenders under our 2023 Credit Agreement will have the right to proceed against these pledged capital stock and take control of substantially all of our assets.
Our cash requirements may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing and we may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms, or at all.
Our 2023 Credit Agreement may not be sufficient for our future working capital, investments and cash requirements, in which case we would need to seek additional debt or equity financing or scale back our operations. In addition, we may need to seek additional financing to achieve and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios under our 2023 Credit Agreement. We may not be able to access additional capital resources due to a variety of reasons, including the restrictive covenants in our 2023 Credit Agreement and the lack of available capital due to global economic conditions. If our financing requirements are not met and we are unable to access additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, our business, financial condition, operating results, and future growth prospects could be materially adversely affected.
Our indebtedness could expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt.
Our 2023 Credit Agreement provides for interest to be calculated based on the prime rate, the federal funds rate and/or the secured overnight financing rate. Increases in interest rates on which the 2023 Credit Agreement interest rates are based would increase interest rates on our debt, which could materially adversely impact our interest expense, operating results and cash flows.
We are exposed to the credit risk of our channel partners and direct customers, which could result in material losses.
Most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with standard payment terms of 30 days in the United States and, because of local customs or conditions, longer in some markets outside the U.S. We monitor partners’ and direct end customers’ payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the end customers can pay and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts. Any significant delay or default in the collection of significant accounts receivable could potentially result in an increased need for us to obtain working capital from other sources, possibly on less favorable terms than we could have negotiated if we had established such working capital resources prior to such delays or defaults. Any significant default could adversely affect our operating results and delay our ability to recognize revenue.
A material portion of our sales is derived through our distributors, systems integrators, and value-added resellers. Some of our distributors, systems integrators and value-added resellers may experience financial difficulties, which could adversely affect our collection of accounts receivable. Our exposure to credit risks of our channel partners may increase if our channel partners and their end customers are adversely affected by global or regional economic conditions. One or more of these channel partners could delay payments or default on credit extended to them, either of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and future financial performance.
Macroeconomic factors such as rising interest rates and increasing inflation could put additional financial pressures on some partners and customers, which could result in longer collection times or default on payment to us.

We intend to invest in engineering, sales, services, marketing and manufacturing on a long-term basis, and delays or inability to attain the expected benefits may result in unfavorable operating results.
While we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses, over the long term, we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering, sales, services, marketing and manufacturing functions as we focus on our foundational priorities, such as leadership in our core products and solutions and architectures for business transformation. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower, or may develop more slowly, than we expect. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our business, financial condition, and operating results may be adversely affected.
We are required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and publicly disclose any material weaknesses in our controls. Any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and significant expense to remediate, and ultimately could have an adverse effect on our stock price.

24

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to disclose if such controls were unable to provide assurance that a material error would be prevented or detected in a timely manner. We have an ongoing program to review the design of our internal controls framework in keeping with changes in business needs, implement necessary changes to our controls design and test the system and process controls necessary to comply with these requirements. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company will have been detected.
If we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies material weaknesses in our internal controls, the disclosure of that fact, even if quickly remedied, may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and its stock price may decline. Remediation of a material weakness could require us to incur significant expenses and, if we fail to remedy any material weakness, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, our access to the capital markets may be restricted, our stock price may decline, and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, including the SEC or Nasdaq. We may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods. Execution of restatements creates a significant strain on our internal resources and could cause delays in our filing of quarterly or annual financial results, increase our costs and cause management distraction. Restatements may also significantly affect our stock price in a materially adverse manner.
We may not fully realize the anticipated positive impacts to future financial results from our restructuring efforts.
We have undertaken restructuring efforts in the past to streamline operations and reduce operating expenses. Our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from our restructuring efforts within expected time frames is subject to many estimates and assumptions and may vary materially based on factors such as market conditions and the effect of our restructuring efforts on our work force. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure that we will fully realize the anticipated positive impacts to future financial results from our current or future restructuring efforts. If our estimates and assumptions are incorrect or if other unforeseen events occur, we may not achieve the cost savings expected from such restructurings, and our business, financial condition, operating results and future financial performance could be materially adversely affected.
We may not realize anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions, divestitures and strategic investments, and the integration of acquired companies or technologies may negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results or dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders.
As part of our business strategy, we review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that we believe would complement our current product offerings, augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. In the event of any future acquisitions, we could:
•
issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders’ percentage ownership;
•
incur substantial debt;
•
assume contingent liabilities; or
•
expend significant cash
These actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results or the price of our common stock.
There can be no assurance we will achieve the revenues, growth prospects, and synergies expected from any acquisition in the anticipated timeframe, or at all, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. Moreover, even if we do obtain benefits in the form of increased sales and earnings, these benefits may be recognized much later than the time when the expenses associated with an acquisition are incurred. This is particularly relevant in cases where it would be necessary to integrate new types of technology into our existing portfolio and new types of products may be targeted for potential customers with which we do not have pre-existing relationships.
Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any current and future acquisitions, divestitures and investment activities also entail numerous risks, including, but not limited to:
•
difficulties in the assimilation and successful integration of acquired operations, sales functions, technologies, products, and/or personnel;
•
unanticipated costs, litigation or other contingent liabilities associated with the acquisition or investment transaction;
•
incurrence of acquisition- and integration-related costs, goodwill or in-process research and development impairment charges, or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets, that could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and operating results;
•
the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;
•
adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; 
•
risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;
•
the potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations and inability to attract or retain other key employees; and

25

•
substantial charges for the amortization of certain purchased intangible assets, deferred stock compensation or similar items.
If any of these risks occur, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and future financial performance.
Regulatory, Tax and Legal Risks
We are subject to complex tariff regulations, export control laws and economic and trade sanctions. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could incur penalties and sanctions from governments, and could be restricted from exporting products.
We are required to comply with laws, rules and regulations of the United States and other countries, as applicable, relating to export controls and economic sanctions, including, but not limited to, trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, as well as the Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce. These regulations restrict our ability to market, sell, distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons. Violations of these regulations, laws, or key control policies by our employees, contractors, channel partners, or agents could result in termination of our relationship, financial reporting problems, fines, and/or civil or criminal penalties for us, or prohibition on the importation or exportation of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. For example, on October 7, 2022, we submitted voluntary disclosures to the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Bureau of Industry and Security’s Office of Export Enforcement, and the Department of Justice (collectively, the “Agencies”) regarding the potential export and sale of certain of our networking equipment to end users in Russia subject to U.S. sanctions and export control restrictions. We are continuing our review of the matter in conjunction with outside counsel. Given the uncertainty of the outcome of the investigation, and the potential outcome of the Agencies’ determination, we cannot estimate at this time the possible loss or range of loss that may result from this action.
Our employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from, or conflict with, those in the United States or in other countries in which we operate. In many foreign countries, it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. regulations applicable to us. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and training designed to ensure compliance with these U.S. and foreign laws and policies, there can be no complete assurance that any individual employee, contractor, channel partner, or agent will not violate our policies, procedures or applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to:
•
comply with securities laws and regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities;
•
comply with export controls and sanctions laws and regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities;
•
comply with anti-corruption laws such as the FCPA and regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities;
•
comply with internal controls that we have established;
•
report financial information or data accurately; or
•
disclose unauthorized activities to us.
The precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. Violations of these regulations, laws, or key control policies by our employees, contractors, channel partners, or agents could result in termination of our relationship, financial reporting problems, fines, and/or civil or criminal penalties for us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
Our operating results may be negatively affected by legal proceedings.
We have in the past, currently are and will likely in the future pursue or be subject to claims or lawsuits in the normal course of our business. In addition to the risks related to the intellectual property lawsuits described herein, we are currently parties to other litigation as described in Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Regardless of the result, litigation can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. An unfavorable resolution of a lawsuit in which we are a defendant could result in a court order against us or payments to other parties that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Even if we are successful in prosecuting claims and lawsuits, we may not recover damages sufficient to cover our expenses incurred to manage, investigate and pursue the litigation. In addition, subject to certain limitations, we may be obligated to indemnify our current and former customers, suppliers, directors, officers and employees in certain lawsuits. We may not have adequate insurance coverage to cover all of our litigation costs and liabilities.

26

Claims of infringement by others may increase and the resolution of such claims may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patents, copyrights (including rights to “open-source” software) and other intellectual property rights. As we have grown, we have, and may continue to, experience greater revenues and increased public visibility, which may cause competitors, customers, and governmental authorities to be more likely to initiate litigation against us. Because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field, the secrecy of some pending patents and the issuance of new patents at a rapid pace, it is not possible to determine in advance if a product or component might infringe the patent rights of others. Because of the potential for courts awarding substantial damages, or internationally prohibiting us from importing or exporting our products in or out of certain countries, the lack of predictability of such awards and the high legal costs associated with the defense of such patent infringement matters that would be expended to prove lack of infringement, it is not uncommon for companies in our industry to settle even potentially unmeritorious claims for very substantial amounts. Furthermore, the entities with whom we have or could have disputes or discussions include entities with extensive patent portfolios and substantial financial assets. These entities are actively engaged in programs to generate substantial revenues from their patent portfolios and are seeking or may seek significant payments or royalties from us and others in our industry.
Litigation resulting from claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others has resulted and could in the future result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We previously received notices from entities alleging that we were infringing their patents and have been party to patent litigation in the past.
Without regard to the merits of these or any other claims, an adverse court order or a settlement could require us, among other actions, to:
•
stop selling our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;
•
obtain a royalty-bearing license to sell or use the relevant technology, and that license may not be available on reasonable terms or available at all;
•
pay damages;
•
redesign those products that use the disputed technology; or
•
face a ban on importation or exportation of our products into the United States or into another country.
In addition, our products include so-called “open-source” software. Open-source software is typically licensed for use at no initial charge but imposes on the user of the open-source software certain requirements to license to others both the open-source software as well as modifications to the open-source software under certain circumstances. Our use of open-source software subjects us to certain additional risks for the following reasons:
•
open-source license terms may be ambiguous and may result in unanticipated obligations regarding the licensing of our products and intellectual property;
•
open-source software cannot be protected under trade secret law;
•
suppliers of open-source software do not provide the warranty, support and liability protections typically provided by vendors who offer proprietary software; and
•
it may be difficult for us to accurately determine the developers of the open-source code and whether the acquired software infringes third-party intellectual property rights.
We believe even if we do not infringe the rights of others, we will incur significant expenses in the future due to defense of legal claims, disputes or licensing negotiations, though the amounts cannot be determined. These expenses could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
We rely on the availability of third-party licenses.
Some of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property, including open-source software, licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products. There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms, if at all. The inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. Moreover, the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products. Further, the failure to comply with the terms of any license, including free open-source software, may result in our inability to continue to use such license, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and future financial performance.
Failure to protect our intellectual property could affect our business.
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. However, we cannot ensure that the actions we have taken will adequately protect our intellectual property rights or that other parties will not independently develop similar or competing products that do not infringe on our patents. With the

27

advent of GenAI, there is a risk that when employees use GenAI tools, data will leak outside the Company that could lead to breach of confidentiality or a disclosure of trade secrets that are being developed.
We generally enter into confidentiality, invention assignment or license agreements with our employees, consultants and other third parties with whom we do business, and control access to and distribution of our intellectual property and other proprietary information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise misappropriate or use our products or technology, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
Our provision for income taxes and overall cash tax costs are affected by a number of factors, including reorganizations or restructurings of our business, jurisdictional revenue mix and changes in tax regulations or policy, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
We are a U.S. multinational company subject to income tax as well as non-income-based taxes in various jurisdictions including Ireland, where we have an operating company supporting our business in most non-U.S. jurisdictions. Our income taxes are subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by a number of factors including earnings that are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher tax rates, changes in tax laws and regulations and interpretations of those changes, expiration of or lapses in the research and development tax credit laws, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, transfer pricing adjustments  related to our methods for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, tax effects of nondeductible compensation, including stock-based compensation, a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest certain foreign earnings, changes in accounting principles and imposition of withholding or other taxes on payments by subsidiaries or customers. In particular, there are many aspects of the U.S.’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act for which specific guidance is not yet available, and could impact us in unanticipated ways.
Determination of our worldwide tax liability involves significant judgment in the interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our intercompany relationships are, and will continue to be, subject to complex transfer pricing rules in every jurisdiction in which we operate and will be subject to challenge by tax authorities.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there is no assurance that the final determination of our income tax liability will not be materially different than what is reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. Due to shifting economic and political conditions, tax rates and policies in the United States as well as international jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. The application and interpretation of such policy changes and underlying regulations, including taxation of earnings internationally, transfer pricing adjustments related to certain acquisitions, including the license of acquired intangibles under our cost sharing arrangement, Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax laws, Global Intangible Low-Tax Income (“GILTI”) laws, and the disallowance of tax deductions for certain expenses, as well as changes that may be enacted in the future, could materially impact our tax provision, cash tax liability and effective tax rate.	
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), an international association comprised of 38 countries including the U.S. and Ireland, has made changes to numerous long-standing tax principles in the form of its Pillar Two framework, which effectively imposes a minimum tax rate of 15% in each taxing jurisdiction globally. Many countries have adopted or are positioned to adopt portions or all of the proposed rules. Where enacted, the rules are effective for us in fiscal 2025. We have assessed the impact of Pillar Two to be immaterial to our overall tax provision for fiscal 2025, however, there can be no assurance that future adoption of these rules by associated countries, will not have a materially adverse impact on our provision for income taxes.
Many countries are also actively considering changes to existing tax laws and rates or have proposed or enacted new laws that could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business or cause us to change the way we operate the business including taxes on digital services, withholding taxes on royalties and taxes on intercompany service charges. We have assessed the impacts of these rules in the countries where we currently operate and do not currently anticipate a material impact to our tax liabilities, however, given the lack of statutory guidance and historical precedent, we can provide no assurance that our tax liabilities will not be materially impacted in the future under these or similar initiatives.
Finally, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, Irish Revenue, and other tax authorities globally. Although we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes, there is no assurance our assessments are, in fact, adequate. Changes in our effective tax rates or amounts assessed upon examination of our tax returns may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
Any actual or perceived failure to comply with new or existing laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the privacy, security and processing of personal information could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
In connection with running our business, we receive, store, use and otherwise process information that relates to individuals and/or constitutes “personal data,” “personal information,” “personally identifiable information,” or similar terms under applicable data privacy laws (collectively, “Personal Information”), including from and about actual and prospective customers, as well as our employees and business contacts and information we process for or on behalf of our customers in the course of our business. We are therefore subject to certain laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the privacy, security, and handling of Personal Information either directly

28

or where we are processing Personal Information for or on behalf of our customers or another third party. For example, the E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation, and similar laws in other jurisdictions require us to adhere to certain disclosure restrictions and deletion obligations with respect to the Personal Information of their residents, and allow for penalties for violations. We have invested, and continue to invest, human and technology resources in our efforts to comply with such requirements that may be time-intensive and costly.
The application and interpretation of such requirements are constantly evolving and are subject to change, creating a complex compliance environment. In some cases, these requirements may be either unclear in their interpretation and application or they may have inconsistent or conflicting requirements with each other. Further, there has been a substantial increase in legislative activity and regulatory focus on data privacy and security, including in relation to cybersecurity incidents. In addition, some such requirements place restrictions on our ability to process Personal Information across our business or across country borders.
It is possible that new laws, regulations and other requirements, or amendments to or changes in interpretations of existing laws, regulations and other requirements, may require us to incur significant costs, implement new processes, or change our handling of information and business operations, which could ultimately hinder our ability to grow our business by extracting value from our data assets. In addition, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with laws, regulations and other requirements relating to the privacy, security, and handling of information could result in legal claims or proceedings (including class actions), regulatory investigations, or enforcement actions. We could incur significant costs in investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, pay significant damages or fines or be required to make changes to our business. These proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant negative publicity and an erosion of trust. If any of these events were to occur, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
Failure of our products to comply with evolving industry standards and complex government regulations may adversely impact our business.
If we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards, certifications, and government regulations, we may not be able to sell our products where these standards, certifications, or regulations apply. The networking industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid changes in technology and customers' requirements and evolving industry standards. As a result, our success depends on:
•
the timely adoption and market acceptance of industry standards, and timely resolution of conflicting U.S. and international industry standards; and
•
our ability to influence the development of emerging industry standards and to introduce new and enhanced products that are compatible with such standards;
•
in some cases, on our ability to achieve and maintain certifications.
In the past, we have introduced new products that were not compatible with certain technological standards, and in the future, we may not be able to effectively address the compatibility and interoperability issues that arise as a result of technological changes and evolving industry standards.
Our products must also comply with various U.S. federal government regulations and standards defined by agencies such as the FCC, standards established by governmental authorities in various foreign countries and recommendations of the International Telecommunication Union. In some circumstances, we must obtain regulatory approvals or certificates of compliance before we can offer or distribute our products in certain jurisdictions or to certain customers. Complying with new regulations or obtaining certifications can be costly and disruptive to our business.
Customers are increasingly demanding that products are certified to external standards, such as those promulgated by the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”).

If we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards or government regulations, or achieve and maintain relevant certifications, we will not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply or where such certifications are required, which may prevent us from sustaining our net revenues or achieving profitability.
Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of Extreme, which could decrease the value of our common stock.
Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors ("Board"). Delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. In addition, our Board has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer. Although we believe these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law will provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders.

29

Our bylaws, as amended, provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders to us, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, any action to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the United States shall be the exclusive forum for any cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, other employees and stockholders. Furthermore, the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive-forum provisions, and there can be no assurance that such provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.
Compliance with laws, rules and regulations relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.
Federal securities laws, rules and regulations, as well as Nasdaq rules and regulations, require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures, impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their Chief Executive Officers, Chief Financial Officers and directors for securities law violations. These laws, rules and regulations and the interpretation of these requirements are evolving, and we continue to evaluate current practices to maintain compliance, which may require investments that may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results.
General
Natural or man-made disasters, climate change, acts of war or terrorism, pandemics, technological disruptions or other events beyond our control could disrupt our operations and harm our business, financial condition and operating results.
We have major offices in Morrisville, North Carolina; San Jose, California; Salem, New Hampshire; Bangalore, India; Markham, Canada; Shannon, Ireland; and Reading, United Kingdom. We have contract manufacturers located in Taiwan, Vietnam, and the Philippines. Historically, each location has been vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks, such as earthquakes, fires, floods, and severe storms, which could disrupt the local or even global economy, create power and communication disruptions, and pose physical risks to property belonging to us or our contract manufacturers. Global shipping could also be disrupted by such events, which would impede our ability to get product to our customers. Climate change may exacerbate the frequency or severity of some natural disasters.
Regulations related to climate change and/or greenhouse gas emissions could have an impact on our supply chain, business operations, and regulatory compliance requirements. Customers or potential customers may impose climate change-related requirements on us that are costly or may require us to forego certain revenue.
Civil unrest, riots, pandemics, acts of terrorism, and other systemic disruptions could disrupt demand for products, supply chain, or distribution and could negatively impact our costs or revenue. Such disruptions to the availability or integrity of utilities, transportation infrastructure, or the internet could have significant macroeconomic impacts, decreasing demand for our products and impacting our ability to get them to market. As a result, our business, financial situation, and operating results could be negatively affected.

Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy

We have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems and information.

We design and assess our program based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (“NIST CSF”). This does not imply that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications, or requirements, only that we use the NIST CSF as a guide to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business.

30

Our cybersecurity risk management program is 
integrated
 into our overall enterprise risk management program, and shares common methodologies, reporting channels and governance processes that apply across the enterprise risk management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational, and financial risk areas.

Key elements of our cybersecurity risk management program, include, but are not limited to the following:

•
risk assessments designed to help identify material cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services, and our broader enterprise IT environment; 
•
a security team principally responsible for managing (1) our cybersecurity risk assessment processes, (2) our security controls, and (3) our response to cybersecurity incidents; 
•
the use of external service providers, where appropriate, to assess, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls;

•
cybersecurity awareness training of our employees;  
•
a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes procedures for responding to cybersecurity incidents; and 
•
a third-party risk management process for key service providers, suppliers, and vendors based on our assessment of their criticality to our operations and respective risk profile.

We have 
not identified
 risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition
. We face risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition. See “Risk Factors – 
System security risks, data breaches, and cyberattacks could compromise our proprietary information, disrupt our internal operations, impact services to customers, and harm public perception of our products, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and future growth prospects
”.
Cybersecurity Governance

Our Board considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the Audit Committee oversight of cybersecurity and other information technology risks. 
The Audit Committee oversees management’s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program.
The Audit Committee receives regular reports from our Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) regarding any significant cybersecurity incidents, as well as any incidents with lesser impact potential.
 The Chief Information and Customer Officer (“CICO”) and CISO periodically report to the full Board regarding cybersecurity risks and our cyber risk management program. Board members periodically receive presentations on cybersecurity topics from our CICO, our CISO, or external experts as part of the Board’s continuing education on topics that impact public companies.
Our management team, including our CICO and our CISO, is responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats.

The team has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program and supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and our retained external cybersecurity consultants.
 Our CICO and CISO collectively have decades of IT and cybersecurity experience in technology companies, including significant experience in senior-level leadership roles. Additionally, our CISO holds Certified Information Security Manager and Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control certifications. Our CICO and CISO are assisted by a cross-functional Information Security Steering Committee.
Our management team takes steps to stay informed about and monitor efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybers
ecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include briefings from internal security personnel; threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us; and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in the IT environment.

In addition to our headquarters in Morrisville, we lease additional sites in the United States, including in Salem, New Hampshire and San Jose, California for research and development, sales and marketing and administrative purposes. Outside the United States, we also lease facilities in other geographic locations for research and development, sales and service personnel and administration, including other cities in the Americas, EMEA and APAC, such as Bangalore, India; Chennai, India; Markham, Canada; Reading, United Kingdom; Shannon, Ireland; and other locations.
As of June 30, 2025, we have an aggregate of approximately 0.5 million square feet of leased space with various expiration dates between fiscal year 2025 and fiscal 2033. We are continuously evaluating our leased locations. As leases expire, we analyze key metrics such as attendance and usage when determining whether to extend the lease, reduce the size of the facility or allow the lease to expire.
