Risks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements

We have a history of operating losses and expect to continue to incur operating losses in the near term.

Since inception, we have been engaged in substantial research and development and capital investments, and we have operated at an operating loss each year and expect to continue doing so in the near term. While we currently expect to achieve profitability for the year 2027, our expectations are based on a variety of assumptions, and actual results, including whether we achieve profitability on our expected timeline or at all, may materially differ from our expectations. Our operating results, including our ability to achieve profitability, will depend, in part, on non-recurring events, the success of our commercialization efforts, and the rate of our future expenditures. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:

•
continue our research and nonclinical and clinical development of our product candidates; 

•
expand the scope of our current clinical studies for our product candidates; 

•
advance our programs into more expensive clinical studies; 

•
initiate additional nonclinical, clinical, or other studies for our product candidates; 

•
pursue preclinical and clinical development for additional indications for existing products and product candidates; 

31

•
change or add additional manufacturers or suppliers; 

•
expand upon our manufacturing-related facilities and capabilities, particularly as we continue to increase operations at our GMP gene therapy manufacturing facility;

•
seek regulatory and marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical studies; 

•
continue to establish Medical Affairs field teams to initiate relevant disease education;

•
continue to establish or grow a marketing and distribution infrastructure and field force to commercialize our products and any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval; 

•
continue to manage our international subsidiaries and establish new ones;

•
continue to operate as a public company and comply with legal, accounting and other regulatory requirements;

•
seek to identify, assess, license, acquire, and/or develop other product candidates, technologies, and/or businesses; 

•
make milestone or other payments under any license or other agreements; 

•
seek to maintain, protect, and expand our intellectual property portfolio; 

•
seek to attract and retain skilled personnel; 

•
create additional infrastructure, including facilities and systems, to support the growth of our operations, our product development, and our commercialization efforts; and

•
experience any delays or encounter issues with any of the above, including, but not limited to, failed studies, complex results, safety issues, inspection outcomes, or other regulatory challenges that require longer follow-up of existing studies, additional major studies, or additional supportive studies in order to pursue marketing approval.

Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase such profitability on a quarterly or yearly basis. Our operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance.

We have limited experience in generating revenue from product sales.

Our ability to generate significant revenue from product sales depends on our ability, alone or with strategic collaboration partners, to successfully commercialize our products and to complete the development of, and obtain the regulatory and marketing approvals necessary to commercialize, our product candidates. Our ability to generate substantial future revenue from product sales, including named patient sales, depends heavily on our success in many areas, including, but not limited to:

•
obtaining regulatory and marketing approvals with broad indications for product candidates for which we complete clinical studies; 

•
developing a sustainable and scalable manufacturing process for our products and any approved product candidates and establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that can conduct the processes and provide adequate (in amount and quality) product supply to support market demand for our products and product candidates, if approved; 

•
launching and commercializing our products and product candidates for which we obtain regulatory and marketing approval, either directly or with a collaborator or distributor; 

•
obtaining market acceptance of our products and product candidates as viable treatment options; 

•
obtaining adequate market share, reimbursement and pricing for our products and product candidates;

•
our ability to sell our products and product candidates on a named patient basis or through an equivalent mechanism and the amount of revenue generated from such sales;

•
our ability to find patients so they can be diagnosed and begin receiving treatment;

•
addressing any competing technological and market developments; 

•
negotiating favorable terms, including commercial rights, in any collaboration, licensing, or other arrangements into which we may enter, any amendments thereto or extensions thereof; 

32

•
maintaining, protecting, and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, and know-how; and 

•
attracting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel. 

If the number of our addressable rare disease patients is not as significant as we estimate, the indication approved by regulatory authorities is narrower than we expect, or the reasonably accepted population for treatment is narrowed by competition, physician choice, or treatment guidelines, or any other reasons, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of our products, even if they receive regulatory approval.

We may need to raise additional capital to fund our activities. Such additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit, or terminate our product development efforts or other activities.

As of December 31, 2024, our available cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities were $745.0 million. We may need additional capital to continue to commercialize our products, and to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, all of our product candidates. In addition, our operating plans may change as a result of many factors that may currently be unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:

•
the scope, rate of progress, results, and cost of our clinical studies, nonclinical testing, and other related activities; 

•
the cost of manufacturing clinical and commercial supplies of our products and product candidates; 

•
the cost of creating additional infrastructure, including facilities and systems, such as systems in our GMP gene therapy manufacturing facility; 

•
the cost of operating and maintaining our gene therapy manufacturing facility; 

•
the number and characteristics of the product candidates that we pursue; 

•
the cost, timing, and outcomes of regulatory approvals; 

•
the cost and timing of establishing and operating our international subsidiaries;

•
the cost and timing of establishing and operating field forces, marketing, and distribution capabilities; 

•
the cost and timing of other activities needed to commercialize our products; and 

•
the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, acquisition, and other arrangements that we may establish, including any required milestone, royalty, and reimbursements or other payments thereunder.

Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management’s attention from their day-to-day activities, which can adversely affect our ability to develop our product candidates and commercialize our products. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all, particularly in light of the current macroeconomic conditions, including changing interest rates and inflation. The terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance of additional securities by us, whether equity or debt, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities would dilute all of our stockholders. If we incur debt, it could result in increased fixed payment obligations and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell, or license intellectual property rights, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We have in the past sought and may in the future seek funds through a sale of future royalty payments similar to our transactions with Royalty Pharma and OMERS or through collaborative partnerships, strategic alliances, and licensing or other arrangements, such as our transaction with Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., or Daiichi Sankyo, and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates, future revenue streams, research programs, and other product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and prospects. Even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or if we have specific strategic considerations.

In addition, we purchase or enter into a variety of financial instruments and transactions, including investments in commercial paper, the extension of credit to corporations, institutions and governments. If any of the issuers or counterparties to these instruments were to default on their obligations, it could materially reduce the value of the transaction and adversely affect our cash flows.

33

If our cash flows are materially and adversely affected or if we are unable to access our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments and/or are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, or at all, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay, or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs or the commercialization of our products and any approved product candidates or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Risks Related to the Discovery and Development of Our Product Candidates

Clinical drug development involves a lengthy, complex, and expensive process with uncertain outcomes and the potential for substantial delays, and the results of earlier studies may not be predictive of future study results.

Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, complex, time consuming, and uncertain as to outcome. We cannot guarantee that any clinical studies will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. We have also had difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical staff for our studies, and may continue to experience such difficulties. Additionally, a failure of one or more clinical studies can occur at any stage of testing, and our future clinical studies may not be successful. Product candidates that have shown promising results in early-stage clinical studies may still suffer significant setbacks or fail in subsequent clinical studies. The safety or efficacy results generated to date in clinical studies do not ensure that later clinical studies will demonstrate similar results. Further, we have reported and expect to continue to report preliminary or interim data from our clinical trials. Preliminary or interim data from our clinical trials are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and/or more patient data become available. Such data may show initial evidence of clinical benefit, but as patients continue to be assessed and more patient data become available, there is a risk that any therapeutic effects are no longer durable in patients and/or decrease over time or cease entirely. As a result, preliminary or interim data should be considered carefully and with caution until the final data are available. Results from investigator-sponsored studies or compassionate-use studies may not be confirmed in company-sponsored studies or may negatively impact the prospects for our programs. Additionally, given the nature of the rare diseases we are seeking to treat, we often devise newly-defined endpoints to be tested in our studies, which can lead to subjectivity in interpreting study results and could result in regulatory agencies not agreeing with the validity of our endpoints, or our interpretation of the clinical data, and therefore delaying or denying approval. Given the illness of the patients in our studies and the nature of their rare diseases, we have also been required to, or have chosen to, conduct certain studies on an open-label basis. We have in the past, and may in the future, elect to review interim clinical data at multiple time points during the studies, which could introduce bias into the study results and potentially result in denial of approval.

In the biopharmaceutical industry, there is a high failure rate for drugs and biologics proceeding through clinical studies, and product candidates in later stages of clinical studies may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and initial clinical studies. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical studies due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier studies.

Scenarios that can prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include but are not limited to:

•
delays or failures in generating sufficient preclinical, toxicology, or other 
in vivo
 or 
in vitro
 data to support the initiation or continuation of human clinical studies or filings for regulatory approval; 

•
failure to demonstrate a starting dose for our product candidates in the clinic that might be reasonably expected to result in a clinical benefit;

•
delays or failures in developing gene therapy, or other novel and complex product candidates, which are expensive and difficult to develop and manufacture;

•
delays resulting from a shutdown, or uncertainty surrounding the potential for future shutdowns of the U.S. government, including the FDA;

•
delays or failures in reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on study design; 

•
delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with contract research organizations, or CROs, clinical study sites, and other clinical trial-related vendors; 

•
failure or delays in obtaining required regulatory agency approval and/or IRB or EC approval at each clinical study site or in certain countries; 

•
failure to correctly design clinical studies which may result in those studies failing to meet their endpoints or the expectations of regulatory agencies;

34

•
changes in clinical study design or development strategy resulting in delays related to obtaining approvals from IRBs or ECs and/or regulatory agencies to proceed with clinical studies; 

•
imposition of a clinical hold by regulatory agencies after review of an IND application or amendment, another equivalent application or amendment, or an inspection of our clinical study operations or study sites; 

•
delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in our clinical studies; 

•
difficulty collaborating with patient groups and investigators; 

•
failure by our CROs, other third parties, or us to adhere to clinical study requirements; 

•
failure to perform in accordance with the FDA’s and/or ICH’s good clinical practices requirements or applicable regulatory guidelines in other countries; 

•
delays in patients’ completion of studies or their returns for post-treatment follow-up; 

•
patients dropping out of a study; 

•
adverse events associated with the product candidate occurring that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits; 

•
changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols; 

•
greater than anticipated costs associated with clinical studies of our drug candidates, including as a result of inflation; 

•
clinical studies of our drug candidates producing negative or inconclusive results, which may result in us deciding, or regulators requiring us, to conduct additional clinical or nonclinical studies or to abandon drug development programs; 

•
competing clinical studies of potential alternative product candidates or investigator-sponsored studies of our product candidates; and 

•
delays in manufacturing, testing, releasing, validating, or importing/exporting sufficient stable quantities of our product candidates for use in clinical studies or the inability to do any of the foregoing.

Any inability to successfully complete nonclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or negatively impact our ability to generate revenue. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may need to conduct additional toxicology, comparability or other studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical study delays could also shorten any periods during which our products have commercial exclusivity and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could negatively impact our ability to obtain orphan exclusivity and to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.

If we do not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we announce and expect, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and, as a result, our stock price may decline.

For planning purposes, we estimate the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory, and other product development goals, which we sometimes refer to as milestones. These milestones may include the commencement or completion of scientific studies and clinical trials, the timing of patient dosing, the timing, type or clarity of data from clinical trials, the submission or acceptance of regulatory filings, and the potential approval of such regulatory filings. We periodically make public announcements about the expected timing of some of these milestones. All of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions, but the actual timing of these milestones can vary dramatically from our estimates. If we do not meet these publicly announced milestones, the commercialization of our products may be delayed and the credibility of our management may be adversely affected and, as a result, our stock price may decline.

We may find it difficult to identify and enroll patients in our clinical studies due to a variety of factors, including the limited number of patients who have the diseases for which our product candidates are being studied and other unforeseen events. Difficulty in enrolling patients could delay or prevent clinical studies of our product candidates.

Identifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical studies of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical studies depends in part on the speed at which we can recruit patients to participate in testing our product candidates, and we may experience delays in our clinical studies if we encounter difficulties in enrollment.

Each of the conditions for which we plan to evaluate our current product candidates is a rare genetic disease. Accordingly, there are limited patient pools from which to draw for clinical studies. For example, we estimate that approximately 6,000 patients worldwide suffer from GSDIa, for which DTX401 is being studied, and these all may not be treatable if they are immune to the AAV viral vector.

35

In addition to the rarity of these diseases, the eligibility criteria of our clinical studies will further limit the pool of available study participants as we will require patients to have specific characteristics that we can measure or to assure their disease is either severe enough or not too advanced to include them in a study. The process of finding and diagnosing patients is costly and time-consuming, especially since the rare diseases we are studying are commonly underdiagnosed. We also may not be able to identify, recruit, and enroll a sufficient number of appropriate patients to complete our clinical studies because of demographic criteria for prospective patients, the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study, the proximity and availability of clinical study sites for prospective patients, and the patient referral practices of physicians. The availability and efficacy of competing therapies and clinical studies can also adversely impact enrollment. If patients are unwilling to participate in our studies for any reason (such as drug-related side effects), the timeline for and our success in recruiting patients, conducting studies, and obtaining regulatory approval of potential products may be delayed or impaired, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product sales from any of these product candidates could be delayed or prevented. Delays in completing our clinical studies will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue.

The regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming, and inherently unpredictable. Even if we achieve positive results in our pre-clinical and clinical studies, if we are ultimately unable to obtain timely regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.

Our future success is dependent on our ability to successfully commercialize our products and develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and then successfully commercialize one or more product candidates. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates before we receive regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. We have only obtained regulatory approval for three products that we have developed, and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval. Further, as the clinical trial requirements of regulatory authorities and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the product candidates, the regulatory approval process for novel product candidates, such as our gene therapy product candidates, can be more expensive and take longer than for other product candidates, leading to fewer product approvals. To date, very few gene therapy products have received regulatory approval in the U.S. or Europe. The regulatory framework and oversight over development of gene therapy products has evolved and may continue to evolve in the future. Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products. Within the CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. The CBER works closely with the National Institutes of Health, or NIH. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. For example, in January 2020, the FDA issued final guidance to set forth the framework for the development, review and approval of gene therapies. The final guidance pertains to the development of gene therapies for the treatment of specific disease categories, including rare diseases, and to manufacturing and long-term follow up issues relevant to gene therapy, among other topics. At the same time the FDA issued guidance describing the FDA’s approach for determining whether two gene therapy products were the same or different for the purpose of assessing orphan drug exclusivity. Within the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, special rules apply to gene therapy and related products as they are considered advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs. Pursuant to the ATMP Regulation, the Committee on Advanced Therapies, or CAT, is responsible in conjunction with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, for the evaluation of ATMPs. The CHMP and CAT are also responsible for providing guidelines on ATMPs. These guidelines provide additional guidance on the factors that the EMA will consider in relation to the development and evaluation of ATMPs and include, among other things, the preclinical studies required to characterize ATMPs. The manufacturing and control information that should be submitted in a MAA; and post-approval measures required to monitor patients and evaluate the long-term efficacy and potential adverse reactions of ATMPs. Although such guidelines are not legally binding, compliance with them is often necessary to gain and maintain approval for product candidates. In addition to the mandatory risk-management plan, or RMP, the holder of a marketing authorization for an ATMP must put in place and maintain a system to ensure that each individual product and its starting and raw materials, including all substances coming into contact with the cells or tissues it may contain, can be traced through the sourcing, manufacturing, packaging, storage, transport, and delivery to the relevant healthcare institution where the product is used.

36

To obtain regulatory approval in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, we must comply with numerous and varying requirements regarding safety, efficacy, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, clinical studies (including good clinical practices), commercial sales, pricing, and distribution of our product candidates, as described above in “
