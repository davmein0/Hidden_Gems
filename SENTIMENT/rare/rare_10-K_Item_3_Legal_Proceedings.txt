Item 3. Legal Proceedings” for material legal proceedings the Company is aware of. The process of resolving matters through litigation or other means is inherently uncertain, however management does not believe that any ultimate liability resulting from any of these potential claims will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.
Guarantees and Indemnifications

The Company indemnifies each of its directors and officers for certain events or occurrences, subject to certain limits, while the director or officer is or was serving at the Company’s request in such capacity, as permitted under Delaware law and in accordance with its certificate of incorporation and bylaws. The term of the indemnification period lasts as long as a director or officer may be subject to any proceeding arising out of acts or omissions of such director and officer in such capacity. The maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited; however, the Company currently holds director liability insurance. This insurance allows the transfer of risk associated with the Company’s exposure and may enable it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. The Company believes that the fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal. Accordingly, it has not recognized any liabilities relating to these obligations for any period presented.
