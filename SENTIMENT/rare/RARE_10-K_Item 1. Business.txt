Item 1. Business” above for a description of our approved products and our clinical stage pipeline products.

Financial Operations Overview

We are a biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. To date, we have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in identifying, acquiring, and developing our products and product candidates, including conducting clinical studies and providing selling, general and administrative support for these operations. To date, we have funded our operations primarily from the sale of our equity securities, revenues from our commercial products, the sale of certain future royalties, and strategic collaboration arrangements.

We have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Our net losses were $569.2 million and $606.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Substantially all of our net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, our total revenues increased to $560.2 million, compared to $434.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in revenue was driven by higher demand for our approved products.

As of December 31, 2024, we had $745.0 million in available cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates

Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We periodically review our estimates as a result of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in the financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in “Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

71

We define our critical accounting policies as those GAAP accounting principles that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. We believe the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments are as follows:

Accrued Research and Development, and Research and Development Expenses

As part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate and accrue expenses, the largest of which is related to accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing contracts and purchase orders, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual costs.

We record accruals for estimated costs of research, preclinical and clinical studies, and manufacturing development. These costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses. A substantial portion of our ongoing research and development activities is conducted by third-party service providers. We accrue the costs incurred under our agreements with these third parties based on actual work completed in accordance with agreements established with these third parties. We determine the actual costs through discussions with internal personnel and external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. We make judgments and estimates in determining the accrual balance in each reporting period. As actual costs become known, we adjust our accruals. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. Our accrual is dependent, in part, upon the receipt of timely and accurate reporting from clinical research organizations and other third-party vendors.

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist of salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation, lab supplies, materials and facility costs, as well as fees paid to other nonemployees and entities that conduct certain research and development activities on our behalf. Amounts incurred in connection with collaboration and license agreements are also included in research and development expense. Payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received.

To date, there have been no material differences from our accrued estimated expenses to the actual clinical trial expenses; however, due to the nature of estimates, we cannot assure you that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our clinical studies and other research activities.

Revenue Recognition

Product Sales

We sell our approved products through a limited number of distributors. Under Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, revenue from product sales is recognized at the point in time when control is transferred to these distributors. We also recognize revenue from sales of certain products on a “named patient” basis, which are allowed in certain countries prior to the commercial approval of the product. Prior to recognizing revenue, we make estimates of the transaction price, including any variable consideration that is subject to a constraint. Amounts of variable consideration are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur and when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Product sales are recorded net of estimated government-mandated rebates and chargebacks, estimated product returns, and other deductions.

Provisions for returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related revenue is recorded, as estimated by management. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as necessary. Our estimates of government mandated rebates, chargebacks, estimated product returns, and other deductions depends on the identification of key customer contract terms and conditions, negotiated pricing, as well as estimates of sales volumes to different classes of payors. If actual results vary, we may need to adjust these estimates, which could have a material effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment.

Collaboration, License and Royalty Revenue

We have certain license and collaboration agreements that are within the scope of ASC 808, 
Collaborative Agreements
, which provides guidance on the presentation and disclosure of collaborative arrangements. Generally, the classification of the transactions under the collaborative arrangements is determined based on the nature of contractual terms of the arrangement, along with the nature of the operations of the participants. We record our share of collaboration revenue, net of transfer pricing related to net sales in the period in which such sales occur, if we are considered as an agent in the arrangement. We are considered an agent when

72

the collaboration partner controls the product before transfer to the customers and has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the product. Funding received related to research and development services and commercialization costs is generally classified as a reduction of research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, because the provision of such services for collaborative partners are not considered to be part of our ongoing major or central operations.

We also record royalty revenues under certain of our license or collaboration agreements in exchange for license of intellectual property.

We utilize certain information from our collaboration partners to record collaboration revenue, including revenue from the sale of the product, associated reserves on revenue, and costs incurred for development and sales activities. For the periods covered in the financial statements presented, there have been no material changes to prior period estimates of revenues and expenses.

We sold the right to receive certain royalty payments from net sales of Crysvita in certain territories to RPI Finance Trust, or RPI, an affiliate of Royalty Pharma, and to OCM LS23 Holdings LP, an investment vehicle for Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, or OMERS, as further described in “Liabilities for Sales of Future Royalties” below.

We record the royalty revenue from the net sales of Crysvita in the applicable territories on a prospective basis as non-cash royalty revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the term of the applicable arrangement.

The terms of our collaboration and license agreements may contain multiple performance obligations, which may include licenses and research and development activities. We evaluate these agreements under ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, to determine the distinct performance obligations. We analogize to ASC 606 for the accounting for distinct performance obligations for which there is a customer relationship. Prior to recognizing revenue, we make estimates of the transaction price, including variable consideration that is subject to a constraint. Amounts of variable consideration are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur and when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Total consideration may include nonrefundable upfront license fees, payments for research and development activities, reimbursement of certain third-party costs, payments based upon the achievement of specified milestones, and royalty payments based on product sales derived from the collaboration.

If there are multiple distinct performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on our relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price is generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost-plus margin. We estimate the efforts needed to complete the performance obligations and recognize revenue by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligations using input measures.

Inventory

We expense costs associated with the manufacture of our products prior to regulatory approval. Typically, capitalization of such costs begins when we have received the regulatory approval of the product. Prior to the approval of our products by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, manufacturing and related costs are expensed. As of December 31, 2024, we do not hold a material amount of previously expensed inventory for our approved products.

Inventory that is manufactured after regulatory approval is valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value and cost is determined using the average-cost method.

We periodically review our inventories for excess amounts or obsolescence and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to the estimated net realizable value.

Liabilities for Sales of Future Royalties

In December 2019, we entered into a Royalty Purchase Agreement with RPI. Pursuant to the agreement, RPI paid us $320.0 million in consideration for our right to receive royalty payments on the net sales of Crysvita in the European Union, or the EU, the UK, and Switzerland, effective January 1, 2020, under the terms of our Collaboration and License Agreement with Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd., or KKC. The agreement with RPI will automatically terminate, and the payment of royalties to RPI will cease, in the event aggregate royalty payments received by RPI are equal to or greater than the capped amount of $608.0 million prior to December 31, 2030, or in the event aggregate royalty payments received by RPI are less than $608.0 million prior to December 31, 2030, when aggregate royalty payments received by RPI are equal to $800.0 million.

In July 2022, we entered into a Royalty Purchase Agreement with OMERS. Pursuant to the agreement, OMERS paid $500.0 million to us in consideration for the right to receive 30% of the future royalty payments due to us from KKC based on net sales of Crysvita in the U.S. and Canada under the terms of the KKC Collaboration Agreement. The calculation of royalty payments to OMERS

73

is based on net sales of Crysvita beginning in April 2023 and continuing until expiration, which is the earlier of the date on which aggregate payments received by OMERS equals $725.0 million or the date the final royalty payment is made to us under the KKC Collaboration Agreement. Proceeds from these transactions were recorded as liabilities (specifically, liabilities for sales of future royalties on the Consolidated Balance Sheets). We are amortizing $320.0 million and $500.0 million, net of transaction costs of $5.8 million and $9.1 million for RPI and OMERS, respectively.

We record the royalty revenue arising from the net sales of Crysvita in the applicable territories as non-cash royalty revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the term of the arrangements. Our effective annual interest rates were 6.2% and 7.5%, for RPI and OMERS, respectively, as of December 31, 2024.

There are a number of factors that could materially affect the amount and timing of royalty payments from KKC in the applicable territories, most of which are not within our control. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the success of KKC’s sales and promotion of Crysvita, changing standards of care, macroeconomic and inflationary pressures, the introduction of competing products, pricing for reimbursement in various territories, manufacturing or other delays, intellectual property matters, adverse events that result in governmental health authority imposed restrictions on the use of Crysvita, significant changes in foreign exchange rates as the royalty payments are made in U.S. dollars, or USD, while significant portions of the underlying sales of Crysvita are made in currencies other than USD, and other events or circumstances that could result in reduced royalty payments from sales of Crysvita, all of which would result in a reduction of non-cash royalty revenue and the non-cash interest expense over the life of the arrangement. Conversely, if sales of Crysvita in the relevant territories are more than expected, the non-cash royalty revenue and the non-cash interest expense recorded by us would be greater over the term of the arrangements.

Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based compensation costs related to equity awards granted to employees are measured at the date of grant based on the estimated fair value of the award, net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate the grant date fair value of options, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. We expect to continue to grant equity awards in the future, and to the extent that we do, our actual stock-based compensation expense will likely increase. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the use of certain subjective assumptions which determine the estimated fair value of stock-based awards.

•
Expected Term 
— The expected term represents the period that the stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based on the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term). 

•
Expected Volatility—
 The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the look-back period corresponding to the expected term.

Strike price for options, including performance stock options, or PSOs, is equal to the closing market value of our common stock on the date of grant.

In addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, we also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation for our awards. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the expected volatility, expected terms, and forfeiture rates utilized for our stock-based compensation calculations on a prospective basis and will revise in subsequent periods, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

For restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs, the fair value is based on the market value of our common stock on the date of grant, except for certain PSUs with a market vesting condition, for which fair value is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Stock-based compensation expense for RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. PSUs are subject to vest only if certain specified criteria are achieved and the employees’ continued service with the Company. For certain PSUs, the number of PSUs that may vest are also subject to the achievement of certain specified criteria, including both performance conditions and market conditions. Compensation expense for PSUs is recognized only after the achievement of the specified criteria is considered probable and recognized on a straight-line basis between the grant date and the expected vest date, with a catch-up for previously unrecognized expense, if any, recognized in the period the achievement criteria is deemed probable.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, stock-based compensation expense was $158.1 million, $135.2 million, and $130.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, we had $256.8 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation costs, net of estimated forfeitures, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 2 years.

74

Income Taxes

We use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We assess the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

We recognize benefits of uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that such positions will be sustained upon examination based solely on their technical merits, as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon the ultimate settlement. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as a component of income tax expense or benefit. To date, there have been no interest or penalties charged in relation to the unrecognized tax benefits.

As of December 31, 2024, our total gross deferred tax assets were $1,213.7 million. Due to our lack of earnings history and uncertainties surrounding our ability to generate future taxable income, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance. The deferred tax assets were primarily comprised of federal and state tax net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation due to historical or future ownership percentage change rules provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before their utilization.

Our product sales increased $105.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in demand for Crysvita in Latin America resulting from an increase in the number of patients on therapy, ongoing launch of Evkeeza in Japan and in Europe, Middle East and Africa territories, or EMEA, and continued increase in demand for our other approved products.

Our Crysvita royalty revenue and collaboration revenue in the Profit-Share Territory increased by a net $22.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023; this increase in Crysvita revenue is primarily due to an increase in the number of patients on therapy. We transitioned commercial responsibilities to KKC in the Profit-Share Territory in April 2023. Post transition, we recognize our revenue share for Crysvita sales in the Profit-Share Territory as royalty revenue, which was recorded as collaboration revenue prior to the transition.

Other revenue decreased by $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was due to the completion of the technology transfer and the technology transfer period related to the Daiichi Sankyo agreement as of March 31, 2023.

Research and Development Expenses (dollars in thousands)

Research and development expenses include internal and external costs incurred for research and development of our programs and program candidates and expenses related to certain technology that we acquire or license through business development transactions. These expenses consist primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations, manufacturing of drug substance and drug product performed by contract manufacturing organizations and at our gene therapy manufacturing facility, materials and supplies, fees from collaborative and other arrangements including milestones, licenses and other fees, personnel costs including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, and overhead allocations consisting of various support and infrastructure costs.

Clinical programs include study conduct and manufacturing costs related to clinical program candidates. Translational research includes costs for preclinical study work and costs related to preclinical programs prior to IND filing. Upfront license, acquisition, and milestone fees include any significant expenses related to strategic licensing agreements. Approved products include costs for disease monitoring programs for post-marketing clinical studies, medical affairs activities to support scientific discovery efforts on existing programs, and regulatory costs for unapproved regions. Infrastructure costs include direct costs related to laboratory, IT, and equipment depreciation costs, and overhead allocations for human resources, IT, and other allocable costs.

We manage our research and development expenses by identifying the research and development activities we expect to be performed during a given period and then prioritizing efforts based on anticipated probability of successful technical development and regulatory approval, market potential, available human and capital resources, scientific data and other considerations. We regularly review our research and development activities based on unmet medical need and, as necessary, reallocate resources among our research and development portfolio that we believe will best support the long-term growth of our business. We allocate and analyze certain operational expenses by individual product candidates, specifically costs to conduct clinical studies, including expenses incurred with clinical research organizations, direct manufacturing costs, and salaries and benefits. Other operational expenses are not allocated and analyzed by individual product candidates. For instance, costs associated with Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls, or CMC costs, are primarily purchases of materials for our internal gene therapy manufacturing activities that qualify as research and development expenses at the time of purchase but for which the allocation and consumption of such costs by a specific product candidate is not determined; accordingly, CMC costs for gene therapy programs are generally spread across multiple product candidates. Although we do track and allocate certain operational R&D costs at the individual product candidate level, as described above and as reflected in the table below, we do not fully track and allocate research and development expenses at the individual product candidate level.

The following table provides a breakout of our research and development expenses by individual product candidate under each major clinical program type and other research and development categories:

Total research and development expenses increased $49.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The change in research and development expenses was due to:

•
for gene therapy programs, an increase of $25.5 million, primarily related to BLA filing activities for UX111, and continued clinical progress of the other programs, combined with the transition of certain programs to in-house manufacturing which resulted in a decrease in CMC costs and an increase in internal manufacturing costs;

•
for biologic and nucleic acid programs, an increase of $31.3 million, primarily related to the continued clinical progress of the UX143 and GTX102 programs and associated clinical development and manufacturing expenses, partially offset by a reduction in development expense on UX053 for the treatment of Glycogen Storage Disease Type III due to cessation of development activities for the program;

•
for translational research, a decrease of $26.1 million, primarily related to decreases in manufacturing and headcount expense for early stage and IND-stage projects;

•
for upfront license, acquisition, and milestone fees, an increase of $21.5 million, primarily related to the achievement of a clinical enrollment milestone on the GTX-102 program during 2024;

•
for approved products, a decrease of $18.0 million, primarily due to reduced reimbursement of Regeneron collaboration expenses with the completion of the pediatric and open label extension trials for Evkeeza and reduced operating expenses for Crysvita post-marketing studies;

•
for infrastructure, an increase of $2.1 million, primarily related to depreciation of the gene therapy manufacturing facility, depreciation of laboratory-related leasehold improvements and equipment, and IT-related expenses;

•
for stock-based compensation an increase of $12.1 million, primarily related to the increase in total value of stock-based awards granted to employees; and

•
for other research and development expenses, an increase of $1.2 million, primarily related to increased staffing to support internal manufacturing, and administrative and general support.

We expect our annual research and development expenses to moderate in the future as we advance our product candidates through clinical development. The timing and amount of expenses incurred will depend largely upon the outcomes of current or future clinical studies for our product candidates as well as the related regulatory requirements, manufacturing costs, and any costs associated with the advancement of our preclinical programs.

methodology. We realized no benefit for 2023 losses due to a full valuation allowance against the U.S. net deferred tax assets. The benefit was offset by an income tax expense of $3.0 million from foreign jurisdictions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

To date, we have funded our operations primarily from the sale of our equity securities, revenue from our commercial products, the sale of certain future royalties, and strategic collaboration arrangements.

As of December 31, 2024, we had $745.0 million in available cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities. We believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months. Our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities are held in a variety of deposit accounts, interest-bearing accounts, corporate bond securities, commercial paper, U.S. government securities, asset-backed securities, and money market funds. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with a view toward liquidity and capital preservation, and we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and credit risk.

In June 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering in which 8,782,051 shares of common stock were sold, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 1,346,153 shares, at a public offering price of $39.00 per share. In connection with the offering, we sold to certain investors pre-funded warrants, in lieu of common stock, to purchase 1,538,501 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $38.999 per pre-funded warrant, which equals the public offering price per share of common stock less the $0.001 exercise price per share of each pre-funded warrant. The total proceeds that we received from the offering were $381.0 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions.

As of December 31, 2024, none of the pre-funded warrants had been exercised.

In February 2024, we entered into a Sales Agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell shares of the Company’s common stock having an aggregate offering proceeds up to $350.0 million, from time to time, in ATM offerings through Cowen. No shares were sold under this agreement during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Cash Used in Operating Activities

Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses, which consist primarily of research and development and commercial expenditures. Due to our significant research and development expenditures, we have generated significant operating losses since our inception. Cash used to fund operating expenses is affected by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses.

Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $414.2 million and primarily reflected a net loss of $569.2 million, partially offset by non-cash items of $141.1 million, net, which consisted primarily of non-cash collaboration royalty revenues, interest expense related to the sale of future royalties to RPI and OMERS, stock-based compensation, amortization of discounts on marketable debt securities, and depreciation and amortization. The change in operating assets and liabilities also reflected a net increase of cash of $13.9 million, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable, accrued, and other liabilities, primarily related to an increase in accrued collaboration and higher revenue reserves from increased sales of our approved products, combined with an increase in inventory, primarily for Mepsevii and Evkeeza, partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets, primarily in prepaid manufacturing.

79

Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $474.8 million and primarily reflected a net loss of $606.6 million, partially offset by non-cash items of $146.9 million, net, which consisted primarily of non-cash collaboration royalty revenues, interest expense related to the sale of future royalties to RPI and OMERS, net of amounts capitalized, stock-based compensation, amortization of discounts on marketable debt securities, and depreciation and amortization. The change in operating assets and liabilities also reflected a net use of cash of $15.1 million, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable primarily related to an increase in sales of our approved products, partially offset by a net decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets, primarily in prepaid manufacturing.

Cash (Used in) Provided by Investing Activities

Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $17.8 million and was primarily related to $12.5 million in payments for intangible assets related to milestones on our commercial products, partially offset by $4.7 million from net activities in marketable debt securities.

Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $168.0 million and was primarily related to $219.8 million from net activities in marketable debt securities, offset by purchases of property, plant, and equipment of $44.3 million, primarily related to the fit-out of our gene therapy manufacturing facility.

Cash Provided by Financing Activities

Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $399.2 million and was primarily comprised of $381.0 million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock in our June 2024 underwritten public offering and $11.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock from exercise of warrants and equity plan awards, net.

Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $388.1 million and was primarily comprised of $326.5 million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock in our October 2023 underwritten public offering and $53.3 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our ATM.

Funding Requirements

We anticipate that, excluding non-recurring items, we will continue to generate annual losses in the near term as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, and continue with commercialization of approved products. We may require additional capital to fund our operations, to complete our ongoing and planned clinical studies, to commercialize our products, to continue investing in early-stage research capabilities to promote our pipeline growth, to continue to acquire or invest in businesses or products that complement or expand our business, including future milestone payments thereunder, and to further develop our general infrastructure and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.

If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce the scope of, or terminate one or more of our clinical studies, research and development programs, future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the following:

•
the scope, rate of progress, results and cost of our clinical studies, nonclinical testing, and other related activities; 

•
the cost of manufacturing clinical supplies, and establishing commercial supplies, of our product candidates, products that we have begun to commercialize, and any products that we may develop in the future;

•
the cost of operating our GMP gene therapy manufacturing facility;

•
the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue; 

•
the cost, timing, and outcomes of regulatory interactions and approvals; 

•
the cost and timing of establishing our commercial infrastructure, and distribution capabilities; 

•
the impact of macroeconomic conditions, including general economic slowdowns, changing interest rates and inflation on our business operations and operating results; and

•
the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, marketing, distribution, acquisition and other arrangements that we may establish, including any required upfront milestone, royalty, reimbursements or other payments thereunder.

80

We expect to satisfy future cash needs through existing capital balances, revenue from our commercial products, and a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements, and other marketing and distribution arrangements. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements.”

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of operating and finance leases and manufacturing and service contract obligations. See "Note 10. Leases" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for amounts outstanding for operating and finance leases as of December 31, 2024.

Manufacturing and service contract obligations primarily relate to manufacturing of inventory for our approved products, the majority of which are due in the next 12 months. See "Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for these contractual obligations.

The terms of certain of our licenses, royalties, development and collaboration agreements, as well as other research and development activities, require us to pay potential future milestone payments based on product development success. The amount and timing of such obligations are unknown or uncertain. These potential obligations are further described in "Note 9. License and Research Agreements" to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
, requiring public entities to disclose additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to the financial statements on an interim and annual basis. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2024-03.

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, requiring public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments’ significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an interim and annual basis. We adopted ASU 2023-07 during the year ended December 31, 2024.

 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned on our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations. A secondary objective is to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk. Our investment policy provides for investments in low-risk, investment-grade debt instruments. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities totaling $745.0 million, which included bank deposits, money market funds, U.S. government treasury and agency securities, and investment-grade corporate bond securities which are subject to default, changes in credit rating, and changes in market value. The securities in our investment portfolio are classified as available for sale and are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on the fair market value of our cash equivalents and marketable debt securities as of December 31, 2024. To date, we have not experienced a loss of principal on any of our investments and as of December 31, 2024, we did not record any allowance for credit loss from our investments.

81

Foreign Currency Risk

We face foreign exchange risk as a result of entering into transactions denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Due to the uncertain timing of expected payments in foreign currencies, we do not utilize any forward exchange contracts. All foreign transactions settle on the applicable spot exchange basis at the time such payments are made. Volatile market conditions arising from the macroeconomic environment (including financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial institutions), inflation, or global political instability may result in significant changes in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. An adverse movement in foreign exchange rates could have a material effect on payments made to foreign suppliers and payments related to license agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2024, a majority of our revenue, expenses, and capital expenditures were denominated in U.S. dollars. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates during any of the periods presented would not have had a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our “disclosure controls and procedures” as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act. In connection with that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms as of December 31, 2024. For the purpose of this review, disclosure controls and procedures means controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Principal Executive Officer and our Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management used the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission Internal Control - 
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
 (2013 framework), or the COSO framework, to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Management believes that the COSO framework is a suitable framework for its evaluation of financial reporting because it is free from bias, permits reasonably consistent qualitative and quantitative measurements of our internal control over financial reporting, is sufficiently complete so that those relevant factors that would alter a conclusion about the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting are not omitted and is relevant to an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting.

Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, and has concluded that as of such date, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report and has issued a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The report of Ernst & Young LLP is included below.

82

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our fourth quarter ended December 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
 (
2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 19, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent R
egistered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 19, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

Liabilities for sales of future royalties

Description of the Matter

As discussed in Note 11, the Company has entered into two royalty purchase agreements, under which the Company sold its rights to receive royalty payments arising from the net sales of Crysvita in the European and North American markets in exchange for $320 million and $500 million, respectively. The proceeds from each transaction were recorded as liabilities that are being amortized using the effective interest method over the estimated lives of the respective arrangements. In order to determine the amortization of the liabilities, the Company is required to estimate the total amount of future royalty payments to be paid to the respective counterparty, subject to the capped amount, over the life of the arrangement. The Company estimates an imputed interest on the unamortized portion of the liability and records non-cash interest expense relating to the transaction.
Auditing the Company’s liabilities related to the sale of future royalties was complex due to the subjective judgments required to forecast the expected royalty payments subject to each agreement. Specifically, the forecasted revenues of Crysvita involve significant estimation uncertainty given the limited historical Crysvita sales data.

How We Addressed the Matter

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s process of accounting for the liabilities related to the sale of future royalties, including controls over the Company’s estimates of projected sales of Crysvita in the European and North American markets.

F-
2

in Our Audit

To test management’s estimates of the future royalties and the amount of imputed effective interest rates, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions related to the forecasted revenue growth rates, including treatable patient populations, estimated pricing and reimbursement, and the rate of adoption. We compared the significant assumptions with historical trends of actual sales, analyst expectations and performed sensitivity analyses of estimated future royalties to evaluate the changes in the future royalties on the implied effective interest rates.

ULTRAGENYX PHARMACEUTICAL INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.
Organizat
ion and Basis 
of Presentation 
Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc., or the Company, is a biopharmaceutical company incorporated in Delaware.
The 
Company is focused on the identification, acquisition, development, and commercialization of novel products for the treatment of serious rare and ultrarare genetic diseases. The Company operates as 
one
 reportable segment and has four commercially approved products.

Crysvita® (burosumab) is approved in the United States, or U.S., the European Union, or EU, and certain other regions for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphatemia, or XLH, in adult and pediatric patients one year of age and older. Crysvita is also approved in the U.S. and certain other regions for the treatment of fibroblast growth factor 23, or FGF23-related hypophosphatemia in tumor-induced osteomalacia, or TIO, associated with phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors that cannot be curatively resected or localized in adults and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older.
Mepsevii® (vestronidase alfa) is approved in the U.S., the EU and certain other regions, as the first medicine for the treatment of children and adults with mucopolysaccharidosis VII, or MPS VII, also known as Sly syndrome.
Dojolvi® (triheptanoin) is approved in the U.S. and certain other regions for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients severely affected by long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders, or LC-FAOD.
Evkeeza® (evinacumab) is approved in the U.S. and the European Economic Area, or EEA, and Japan for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or HoFH. The Company has exclusive rights to commercialize Evkeeza® (evinacumab) outside of the U.S.
In addition to the approved products, the Company has the following ongoing clinical development programs:

•
UX111 (formerly ABO-102) is an AAV9 gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type A, or MPS IIIA, a rare lysosomal storage disease;
•
DTX401 is an adeno-associated virus 8, or AAV8, gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of patients with glycogen storage disease type Ia, or GSDIa;
•
DTX301 is an AAV8 gene therapy product candidate in development for the treatment of patients with ornithine transcarbamylase, or OTC deficiency, the most common urea cycle disorder;
•
UX143 (setrusumab), which is subject to the Company
’
s collaboration agreement with Mereo BioPharma 3, or Mereo, is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits sclerostin, a protein that acts on a key bone-signaling pathway and inhibits the activity of bone-forming cells for the treatment of patients with Osteogenesis Imperfecta, or OI;
•
GTX-102 is an antisense oligonucleotide, or ASO for the treatment of Angelman syndrome, a debilitating and rare neurogenetic disorder caused by loss-of-function of the maternally inherited allele of the UBE3A gene; and
•
UX701 is an adeno-associated virus 9, or AAV9, gene therapy designed to deliver stable expression of a truncated version of the ATP7B copper transporter following a single intravenous infusion to improve copper distribution and excretion from the body and reverse pathological findings of Wilson liver disease.

The Company has sustained operating losses and expects such annual losses to continue in the near term. The Company’s ultimate success depends on the outcome of its research and development and commercialization activities. Through December 31, 2024
, the Company has relied primarily on its sale of equity securities, its revenues from commercial products, its sale of future royalties, and strategic collaboration arrangements to finance its operations. The Company may need to raise additional capital to fully implement its business plans through the issuance of equity, borrowings, or strategic alliances with partner companies. However, if such financing is not available at adequate levels, the Company would need to reevaluate its operating plans.

2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Basis of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements 
include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company consolidates any variable interest entity, or VIE, for which it is the primary beneficiary.

ULTRAGENYX PHARMACEUTICAL INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Segment Reporting

The Company operates as 
one
 reportable segment relating to the research, development and commercialization of its products. The segment derives its current revenues from its four commercially approved products.
The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker, or CODM, its Chief Executive Officer and the executive leadership team, manage the Company’s operations on an integrated basis for the purposes of allocating resources. When evaluating the Company’s financial performance, the CODM regularly reviews total revenues and total expenses and makes decisions using this information on a global basis.
Use of Estimates

The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of expenses in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to clinical trial accruals, fair value of assets and liabilities, income taxes, stock-based compensation, revenue recognition, and the liabilities for sales of future royalties. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other market-specific and relevant assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of amounts invested in money market accounts.
Restricted cash primarily consists of money market accounts used as collateral for the Company’s obligations under its facility leases and to guarantee the fulfillment of certain sales orders to certain government-sponsored customers.
The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the Consolidated Balance Sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands):

Marketable Debt Securities

All marketable debt securities have been classified as “available-for-sale” and are carried at estimated fair value as determined based upon quoted market prices or pricing models for similar securities. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. Investments with a maturity of one year or less from the balance sheet date are reported as current marketable debt securities and investments with a maturity of greater than one year from the balance sheet date are reported as non-current marketable debt securities. Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and are reported as a component of comprehensive loss. Realized gains and losses and declines in fair value judged to be other than temporary, if any, on available-for-sale securities are included in other expense. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. Interest on investments is included in interest income.
Equity Investments
The Company records investments in equity securities, other than equity method investments, at fair market value, using market quotes when readily determinable. Equity securities with no readily determinable fair values are recorded using the measurement alternative of cost adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer less impairment, if any. Investments in equity securities are recorded in other assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in change in fair value of equity investments on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company regularly reviews its non-marketable equity securities for indicators of impairment.

F-

ULTRAGENYX PHARMACEUTICAL INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Concentration of Credit Risk, Credit Losses, and Other Risks and Uncertainties
Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, and investments. The Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and investments are held by financial institutions that management believes are of high credit quality. The Company’s investment policy limits investments to fixed income securities denominated and payable in U.S. dollars such as U.S. government obligations, money market instruments and funds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, and asset-backed securities and places restrictions on maturities and concentrations by type and issuer. Such deposits may, at times, exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents and its accounts are monitored by management to mitigate risk. The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of default by the financial institutions holding its cash and cash equivalents, corporate issuers, and other financial instruments, to the extent recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company is exposed to credit losses primarily through receivables from customers and collaborators and through its available-for-sale debt securities. For trade receivables and other financial instruments, the Company uses a forward-looking expected loss model that recognizes a current period charge for losses that are expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument.
The Company’s expected loss allowance methodology for the receivables is developed using historical collection experience, current and future economic market conditions, a review of the current aging status and financial condition of the entities. Specific allowance amounts are established to record the appropriate allowance for customers that have a higher probability of default. Balances are written off when determined to be uncollectible. The Company’s expected loss allowance methodology for the debt securities is developed by reviewing the extent of the unrealized loss, the size, term, geographical location, and industry of the issuer, the issuers’ credit ratings and any changes in those ratings, as well as reviewing current and future economic market conditions and the issuers’ current status and financial condition.

For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, the losses are recognized as allowances rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. There was 
no
 allowance for losses on available-for-sale debt securities which were attributable to credit risk for the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The Company is dependent on third-party manufacturers to supply products for research and development activities in its programs. In particular, the Company relies and expects to continue to rely on a small number of manufacturers to supply it with its requirements for the active pharmaceutical ingredients and formulated drugs related to these programs. These programs could be adversely affected by a significant interruption in the supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients and formulated drugs.
Inventory
The Company values inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value and determines the cost of inventory using the average-cost method. The Company expenses costs associated with the manufacture of product candidates prior to regulatory approval. Inventories consist of currently approved products. The Company periodically reviews its inventories for excess amounts or obsolescence and writes down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. Management determines excess inventory based on expected future demand. Estimates related to future demand are sensitive to significant inputs and assumptions such as acceptance by patients and physicians and the availability of formulary coverage and adequate reimbursement from private third-party payers for the product.
Property, Plant, and Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Depreciation and amortization begins when the asset is placed in service. Interest costs incurred during the construction of major capital projects are capitalized until the underlying asset is ready to be placed in service. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Upon sale or retirement of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is reflected in operations. See “Note 4. Balance Sheet Components” for further disclosure on the useful lives of property, plant, and equipment.

F-
11

ULTRAGENYX PHARMACEUTICAL INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Intangible Assets
Finite-lived intangibles consist of contractual payments made for certain milestones achieved with collaboration partners. The contractual payments are recorded as intangible assets and are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews its definite-lived intangible assets when events or circumstances may indicate that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable and exceeds their fair value. The Company measures fair value based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets in addition to other assumptions and projections that the Company deems to be reasonable and supportable.

Indefinite-lived intangibles consist of acquired in-process research and development, or IPR&D. IPR&D assets represent capitalized incomplete research projects that the Company acquired through business combinations. Such assets are initially measured at their acquisition date fair values and are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When development of the project is complete, which generally occurs when regulatory approval to market a product is obtained, the associated assets will be deemed finite-lived and will be amortized over a period that best reflects the economic benefits provided by these assets.
If it is determined that an intangible asset becomes impaired, the carrying value is written down to its fair value with the related impairment charge recognized in Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which the impairment occurs. The Company has not recorded any impairments of intangible assets to date.

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized. Goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually during the fourth quarter or when a triggering event occurs that could indicate a potential impairment. If it is determined that the goodwill becomes impaired, the carrying value is written down to its fair value with the related impairment charge recognized in Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which the impairment occurs. The Company has not recorded any impairments of goodwill.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company evaluates its long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of each asset to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset. The Company has not recorded material impairment of any long-lived assets.
Accruals of Research and Development Costs

The Company records accruals for estimated costs of research, preclinical and clinical studies and manufacturing development. These costs are a significant component of the Company’s research and development expenses. A substantial portion of the Company’s ongoing research and development activities are conducted by third-party service providers, including contract research organizations. The Company accrues the costs incurred under its agreements with these third parties based on actual work completed in accordance with agreements established with these third parties. The Company determines the actual costs through obtaining information from external service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of the services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services.
Liabilities for Sales of Future Royalties
The Company sold the right to receive certain royalty payments from net sales of Crysvita in certain territories to RPI Finance Trust, or RPI, an affiliate of Royalty Pharma, and to OCM LS23 Holdings LP, an investment vehicle for Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, or OMERS, as further described in “Note 11. Liabilities for Sales of Future Royalties.” The Company recorded the liabilities at inception based upon estimated future cash flows discounted at a market rate. The liabilities are being amortized using the effective interest method over the estimated life of the applicable arrangement. In order to determine the amortization of the liabilities, the Company is required to estimate the total amount of future royalty payments to be received by the Company and paid to RPI and OMERS, subject to the capped amount, over the life of the arrangements. The excess of future estimated royalty payments (subject to the capped amount) to RPI and OMERS is recorded as non-cash interest expense over the life of the arrangements. Consequently, the Company estimates an imputed interest on the unamortized portion of the liabilities and records interest expense relating to the transactions.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

The Company periodically assesses the expected royalty payments using a combination of historical results, internal projections and forecasts from external sources. To the extent such payments are greater or less than the Company’s initial estimates or the timing of such payments is materially different than its original estimates, the Company employs the prospective method to adjust the amortization of the liabilities and the effective interest rate.
Revenue Recognition
Product Sales
The Company sells its approved products through a limited number of distributors. Under Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers,
 revenue from product sales is recognized at the point in time when control is transferred to these distributors. The Company also recognizes revenue from sales of certain products on a “named patient” basis, which are allowed in certain countries prior to the commercial approval of the product. Prior to recognizing revenue, the Company makes estimates of the transaction price, including any variable consideration that is subject to a constraint. Amounts of variable consideration are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur and when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Product sales are recorded net of estimated government-mandated rebates and chargebacks, estimated product returns, and other deductions.
Provisions for returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related revenue is recorded, as estimated by management. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as necessary. The Company’s estimates of government mandated rebates, chargebacks, estimated product returns, and other deductions depends on the identification of key customer contract terms and conditions, as well as estimates of sales volumes to different classes of payors. If actual results vary, the Company may need to adjust these estimates, which could have a material effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment.
Collaboration, License, and Royalty Revenue
The Company has certain license and collaboration agreements that are within the scope of ASC 808, 
Collaborative Agreements
, which provides guidance on the presentation and disclosure of collaborative arrangements. Generally, the classification of the transactions under the collaborative arrangements is determined based on the nature of contractual terms of the arrangement, along with the nature of the operations of the participants. The Company records its share of collaboration revenue, net of transfer pricing related to net sales in the period in which such sales occur, if the Company is considered as an agent in the arrangement. The Company is considered an agent when the collaboration partner controls the product before transfer to the customers and has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the product. Funding received related to research and development services and commercialization costs is generally classified as a reduction of research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, because the provision of such services for collaborative partners are not considered to be part of the Company’s ongoing major or central operations.
The Company utilizes certain information from its collaboration partners to record collaboration revenue, including revenue from the sale of the product, associated reserves on revenue, and costs incurred for development and sales activities. For the periods covered in the financial statements presented, there have been no material changes to prior period estimates of revenues and expenses. The Company also records royalty revenues under certain of the Company’s license or collaboration agreements in exchange for license of intellectual property.
As described in “Note 11. Liabilities for Sales of Future Royalties”, for certain royalty payments from net sales of Crysvita in applicable territories that were sold to RPI and OMERS, the Company records the royalty revenue on a prospective basis as non-cash royalty revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the term of the applicable arrangement.
The terms of the Company’s collaboration and license agreements may contain multiple performance obligations, which may include licenses and research and development activities. The Company evaluates these agreements under ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, to determine the distinct performance obligations. The Company analogizes to ASC 606 for the accounting for distinct performance obligations for which there is a customer relationship. Prior to recognizing revenue, the Company makes estimates of the transaction price, including variable consideration that is subject to a constraint. Amounts of variable consideration are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur and when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Total consideration may include nonrefundable upfront license fees, payments for research and

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

development activities, reimbursement of certain third-party costs, payments based upon the achievement of specified milestones, and royalty payments based on product sales derived from the collaboration.
If there are multiple distinct performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price is generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost-plus margin. The Company estimates the efforts needed to complete the performance obligations and recognizes revenue by measuring the progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligations using input measures.
Deferred Compensation Plan
The Company maintains a nonqualified deferred compensation plan whereby certain employees and members of the board of directors are able to defer certain equity awards and other compensation. Amounts deferred are invested into shares of the Company's common stock and corporate-owned life insurance. The plan complies with the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. All the investments held in the plan are recorded in other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The short-term portion of the corresponding liability for the plan is included in accrued expenses. The long-term portion of the liability is included in other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
Changes in the value of the deferred compensation assets and liabilities are recorded in earnings as they occur. Certain equity awards deferred under the plan are required to be settled through the issuance of Company stock. These awards are recorded as treasury stock and deferred compensation obligation within stockholders’ equity.
Leases

Lease agreements are evaluated to determine whether an arrangement is or contains a lease in accordance with ASC 842, 
Leases
. The Company determines if an arrangement includes a lease at inception. Right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. The right-of-use lease asset includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Incremental borrowing rate is used in determining the present value of future payments. The Company applies a portfolio approach to the property leases to apply an incremental borrowing rate to leases with similar lease terms. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. The Company recognizes the options to extend the lease as part of the right-of-use lease assets and lease liabilities only if it is reasonably certain that the option would be exercised. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease term. The Company has elected to not separate lease and non-lease components. See “Note 10. Leases” for further disclosure.
Comprehensive Loss

Comprehensive loss is the change in stockholders’ equity from transactions and other events and circumstances other than those resulting from investments by stockholders and distributions to stockholders. The Company’s other comprehensive loss is comprised of unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale securities and foreign currency translation adjustments.

Research and Development

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist of salaries and benefits, stock-based compensation expense, lab supplies and facility costs, as well as fees paid to other nonemployees and entities that conduct certain research and development activities on the Company’s behalf. Amounts incurred in connection with license agreements are also included in research and development expense. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred. The deferred amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed.

Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based awards issued to employees, including stock options, performance stock options, or PSOs, restricted stock units, or RSUs, and performance stock units, or PSUs are recorded at fair value as of the grant date and recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period). PSOs and PSUs vest only if certain specified criteria are achieved and the employees’ continued service requirements are met; therefore, the expense recognition occurs when the likelihood of the PSOs and PSUs being earned is deemed probable. Stock compensation expense on awards expected to vest is recognized net of estimated forfeitures.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Income Taxes

The Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company must then assess the likelihood that the resulting deferred tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Due to the Company’s lack of earnings history, the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance.

In conjunction with the acquisition of Dimension Therapeutics, Inc., or Dimension, a deferred tax liability was recorded reflecting the tax impact of the difference between the book basis and tax basis of acquired IPR&D. Such deferred income tax liability is not used to offset deferred tax assets when analyzing the Company’s valuation allowance as the acquired IPR&D is considered to have an indefinite life until the Company completes or abandons development of the acquired IPR&D.
The Company recognizes benefits of uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that such positions will be sustained upon examination based solely on their technical merits, as the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon the ultimate settlement. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as a component of income tax expense or benefit. To date, there have been 
no
 interest or penalties charged in relation to the unrecognized tax benefits.

Foreign Currency
Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries that operate in a local currency environment, where the local currency is the functional currency, are translated to U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, with the resulting translation adjustments directly recorded to a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Income and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Transactions which are not in the functional currency of the entity are remeasured into the functional currency and gains or losses resulting from the remeasurement recorded in other expense.

Net Loss per Share

Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Shares of common stock into which pre-funded warrants may be exercised are considered outstanding for the purposes of computing basic net loss per share because the shares may be issued for little or no consideration, are fully vested and are exercisable after the original issuance date. Diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share, since the effects of potentially dilutive securities are antidilutive. In periods when we have incurred a net loss, options and warrants to purchase common stock are considered common stock equivalents, but have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share, as their effect is antidilutive.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, 
Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
, requiring public entities to disclose additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to the financial statements on an interim and annual basis. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2024-03.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, requiring public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments’ significant expenses and other segment items on an interim and annual basis. Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an interim and annual basis. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Fair Value Measurements 
Certain financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value. The carrying amount of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their relatively short maturities. The carrying amounts of liabilities for the sales of future royalties also approximate their fair value. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair values. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or an exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows:

Level 1
—Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date;

Level 2
—Inputs are observable, unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the related assets or liabilities; and

Level 3
—Unobservable inputs that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities that are supported by little or no market data.

The Company’s financial instruments consist of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 assets. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified as Level 1. Money market funds and U.S. Government treasury bills are classified as Level 1. Level 2 assets consist primarily of corporate bonds, asset backed securities, commercial paper, U.S. Government Treasury and agency securities, and debt securities in government-sponsored entities based upon quoted market prices for similar movements in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets. Where applicable these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs obtained from various third-party data providers, including but not limited to, benchmark yields, interest rate curves, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes and reference data.
The Company determines the fair value of its equity investment in Solid Biosciences, Inc., or Solid, by using the quoted market prices, which are Level 1 fair value measurements.
The following tables set forth the fair value of the Company’s financial assets remeasured on a recurring basis based on the three-tier fair value hierarchy (in thousands):

shares 
of series seed preferred stock of Amlogenyx. The purpose of Amlogenyx is to pursue the application of the Company’s novel adeno-associated virus, or AAV, gene therapy to treat beta-amyloid disorders and related neurodegenerative diseases.
Amlogenyx was determined to be a VIE and the Company is the primary beneficiary as it has the power to direct the activities that would most significantly impact the economic performance of Amlogenyx, including the performance of R&D activities relating to its sole product candidate. As the primary beneficiary, the Company has consolidated the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Amlogenyx in its financial statements and all intercompany balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Upon initial consolidation, the non-controlling interest of the third-party investor was recorded at its estimated fair value of $
7.0
 million, which is equal to their original investment.
As of December 31, 2024
, total assets and liabilities included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for Amlogenyx were $
13.5
 million and $
0.1
 million, respectively. The assets primarily consisted of cash and cash equivalents which may only be used to settle obligations of Amlogenyx.
Noncontrolling interest related to the third-party investment in Amlogenyx is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in mezzanine equity.

Changes in the carrying value of noncontrolling interest for the year ended 
December 31, 2024, were as follows:

GeneTx Acquisition
In August 2019, the Company entered into a Program Agreement and a Unitholder Option Agreement with GeneTx Biotherapeutics LLC, or GeneTx, to collaborate on the development of GeneTx’s GTX-102, an ASO for the treatment of Angelman syndrome. In July 2022, pursuant to the terms of the Unitholder Option Agreement, as amended, the Company exercised the option to acquire GeneTx and entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Company purchased all the outstanding units of GeneTx. In accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company paid the option exercise price of $
75.0
 million and an additional $
15.6
 million to acquire the outstanding cash of GeneTx, and adjustments for working capital and transaction expenses of $
0.6
 million, for a total purchase consideration of $
91.2
 million. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company achieved a $
30.0
 million regulatory milestone upon the initiation of the Phase 3 
Aspire
 clinical study for GTX-102. The Company is obligated to pay up to $
85.0
 million in additional regulatory approval milestones for the achievement of U.S. and EU product approvals, and up to $
75.0
 million in commercial milestone payments based on annual worldwide net product sales, contingent upon the achievement of the milestones. The Company will also pay tiered mid- to high single-digit percentage royalties based on licensed product annual net sales. If the Company receives and resells an FDA priority review voucher, or PRV, in connection with a new drug application approval, GeneTx unitholders are entitled to receive a portion of proceeds from the sale or a cash payment from the Company if the Company choses to retain the PRV.

As part of the Company's acquisition of GeneTx, the Company assumed a License Agreement with Texas A&M University, or TAMU. To date, the Company recognized an aggregate of $
0.5
 million for clinical milestones under the TAMU agreement, and have in aggregate up to $
23.0
 million of future obligations for various future milestones and a nominal annual license fee that may increase up to a maximum of $
2.0
 million. The Company will also pay mid-single-digit percentage royalties based on licensed product annual net sales. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $
0.5
 million and 
nil
, respectively, in collaboration payables under this arrangement.
The transaction was accounted as an asset acquisition, as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired was concentrated in a single identifiable in-process research and development intangible asset. Prior to the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones, the acquired in-process research and development intangible asset has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use. 
Accordingly, to date, amounts paid to acquire GeneTx, net of cash and working capital acquired, were classified as in-process research and development expense.

License and Research Agreements
Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd.
In August 2013, the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd., or KKC. Under the terms of this collaboration and license agreement, as amended, the Company and KKC collaborate on the development and commercialization of Crysvita in the field of orphan diseases in the U.S. and Canada, or the Profit-Share Territory, and in the European Union, UK, and Switzerland, or the European Territory, and the Company has the right to develop and commercialize such products in the field of orphan diseases in Mexico and Central and South America, or Latin America.
The collaboration and license agreements are within the scope of ASC 808, which provides guidance on the presentation and disclosure of collaborative arrangements.
Product Sales Revenue for Latin America and Turkey
The Company is responsible for commercializing Crysvita in Latin America and Turkey. The Company is considered the principal in these territories as the Company controls the product before it is transferred to the customer. Accordingly, the Company records revenue on a gross basis for the sale of Crysvita once the product is delivered and the risk and title of the product is transferred to the distributor. In Turkey, KKC has the option to assume responsibility for commercialization efforts.
Transfer Price and Royalties on Product Sales Revenue
Under the collaboration agreement, KKC manufactures and supplies Crysvita, which is purchased by the Company for sales in Latin America and Turkey, and charges the Company a transfer price of 
30
% of net sales. The transfer price on these sales was 
35
% prior to December 31, 2022. The Company also pays to KKC a low single-digit royalty on net sales in Latin America.
Collaboration and Royalty Revenue for Sales in the Profit-Share Territory
The Company and KKC shared commercial responsibilities and profits in the Profit-Share Territory until April 2023. Under the collaboration agreement, KKC manufactured and supplied Crysvita for commercial use in the Profit-Share Territory and charged the Company a transfer price of 
30
% of net sales in 2023, and 
35
% prior to December 31, 2022. The remaining profit or loss after supply costs from commercializing products in the Profit-Share Territory was shared between the Company and KKC on a 
50
/
50
 basis until April 2023. In April 2023, commercialization responsibilities for Crysvita in the Profit-Share Territory transitioned to KKC. Thereafter, the Company is entitled to receive a tiered double-digit revenue share from the mid-
20
% range up to a maximum rate of 
30
%.
The parties subsequently agreed that the Company would have the right to continue to support KKC in commercial field activities in the U.S. through January 31, 2025, as amended. After January 31, 2025, the Company’s rights to promote Crysvita in the U.S. are limited to medical geneticists and the Company solely bears its expenses for the promotion of Crysvita in the Profit-Share Territory.

During the prior profit-share period, as KKC was the principal in the sale transaction with the customer, the Company recognized a pro-rata share of collaboration revenue, net of transfer pricing, in the period the sale occurred. The Company concluded that its portion of KKC’s sales in the Profit-Share Territory prior to April 2023 was analogous to a royalty and therefore recorded its share as collaboration revenue, similar to a royalty. Starting in April 2023, the Company began to record as royalty revenue in the period the underlying sales occurred.

In July 2022, the Company sold to OMERS its right to receive 
30
% of the future royalty payments due to the Company based on net sales of Crysvita in the U.S. and Canada, subject to a cap, beginning in April 2023, as further described in “Note 11. Liabilities for Sales of Future Royalties.”

Royalty Revenue for Sales in the European Territory
KKC has the commercial responsibility for Crysvita in the European Territory. In December 2019, the Company sold its right to receive royalty payments based on sales in the European Territory to Royalty Pharma, effective January 1, 2020, as further described in “Note 11. Liabilities for Sales of Future Royalties.” Prior to the Company’s sale of the royalty, the Company received a royalty of up to 
10
% on net sales in the European Territory, which was recognized as the underlying sales occur. Beginning in 2020, the Company records the royalty revenue as non-cash royalty revenues. The Company records this revenue as royalty revenue.
Total Crysvita revenue was as follows (in thousands):

Development Activities
In the field of orphan diseases, except for ongoing studies being conducted by KKC, the Company was the lead party for development activities in the Profit-Share Territory and in the European Territory until the applicable transition date. The Company shared the costs for development activities in the Profit-Share Territory and the European Territory conducted pursuant to the development plan before the applicable transition date equally with KKC. In April 2023, which was the transition date for the Profit-Share Territory, KKC became the lead party and became responsible for the costs of the subsequent development activities. However, the Company will continue to equally share in the costs of the studies with KKC that commenced prior to the applicable transition date.
Collaboration Cost Sharing and Payments
Under the collaboration agreement, KKC and the Company share certain development and commercialization costs, and as a result, the Company was reimbursed for these costs and operating expenses were reduced. KKC also receives a transfer price and royalty on net product sales revenue which is recorded in cost of sales. 
These amounts were recognized in the Company’s Statements of Operations in connection with the collaboration agreement with KKC as follows (in thousands):

 Going forward, the Company is obligated to pay Regeneron up to an aggregate of $
35.5
 million of future obligations for additional regulatory and sales milestones, if achieved. The Company may share in certain costs for global trials led by Regeneron and also received the right to opt into other potential indications.

Under the collaboration agreement, Regeneron supplies the product and charges the Company a transfer price from the low 
20
% range up to 
40

Leases
The Company leases office space and research, testing and manufacturing laboratory space in various facilities in Novato and Brisbane, California, in Somerville and Woburn, Massachusetts, and in certain foreign countries, under operating agreements expiring at various dates through 
2029
. Certain lease agreements include 
options for the
 Company to extend the lease for 
multiple renewal periods
 and provide for annual minimum increases in rent, usually based on a consumer price index or annual minimum increases. None of these optional periods have been considered in the determination of the right-of-use lease asset or the lease liability for the leases as the Company did not consider it reasonably certain that it would exercise any such options. The Company recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable term of its operating leases. The variable lease expense primarily consists of common area maintenance and other operating costs.

Liabilities for Sales of Future Royalties
In December 2019, the Company entered into a Royalty Purchase Agreement with RPI. Pursuant to the agreement, RPI paid $
320.0
 million to the Company in consideration for the right to receive royalty payments effective January 1, 2020, arising from the net sales of Crysvita in the EU, the U.K., and Switzerland under the terms of the Company’s Collaboration and License Agreement with KKC dated August 29, 2013, as amended, or the KKC Collaboration Agreement. 
The agreement with RPI will automatically terminate, and the payment of royalties to RPI will cease, in the event aggregate royalty payments received by RPI are equal to or greater than $
608.0
 million prior to December 31, 2030, or in the event aggregate royalty payments received by RPI are less than $
608.0
 million prior to December 31, 2030, or when aggregate royalty payments received by RPI are equal to $
800.0
 million.
In July 2022, the Company entered into a Royalty Purchase Agreement with OMERS. Pursuant to the agreement, OMERS paid $
500.0
 million to the Company in consideration for the right to receive 
30
% of the future royalty payments due to the Company from KKC based on net sales of Crysvita in the U.S. and Canada under the terms of the KKC Collaboration Agreement. The calculation of royalty payments to OMERS is based on net sales of Crysvita beginning in April 2023 and will expire upon the earlier of the date on which aggregate payments received by OMERS equals $
725.0
 million or the date the final royalty payment is made to the Company under the KKC Collaboration Agreement.
Proceeds from these transactions were recorded as liabilities for sales of future royalties on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon inception of the respective arrangements, the Company recorded $
320.0
 million and $
500.0
 million, net of transaction costs of $
5.8
 million and $
9.1
 million for RPI and OMERS, respectively. The Company records the royalty revenue arising from the net sales of Crysvita in the applicable territories as royalty revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the term of the arrangements. Royalties earned under the RPI and OMERS arrangements from inception to 
December 31, 2024

F-

ULTRAGENYX PHARMACEUTICAL INC.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

 have been $
99.3
 million and $
123.3
 million, respectively. The Company’s effective annual interest rates were 
6.2
% and 
7.5
%, for RPI and OMERS, respectively, as of 
December 31, 2024.
There are a number of factors that could materially affect the amount and timing of royalty payments from KKC in the applicable territories, most of which are not within the Company’s control. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the success of KKC’s sales and promotion of Crysvita, changing standards of care, macroeconomic and inflationary pressures, the introduction of competing products, pricing for reimbursement in various territories, manufacturing or other delays, intellectual property matters, adverse events that result in governmental health authority imposed restrictions on the use of Crysvita, significant changes in foreign exchange rates as the royalty payments are made in U.S. dollars, or USD, while significant portions of the underlying sales of Crysvita are made in currencies other than USD, and other events or circumstances that could result in reduced royalty payments from sales of Crysvita, all of which would result in a reduction of royalty revenue and the non-cash interest expense over the life of the arrangement. Conversely, if sales of Crysvita in the relevant territories are more than expected, the royalty revenue and the non-cash interest expense recorded by the Company would be greater over the term of the arrangements.

Equity
At-the-Market Offerings
In February 2024, the Company entered into a Sales Agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell shares of the Company’s common stock having an aggregate offering proceeds up to $
350.0
 million, from time to time, in at-the-market, or ATM, offerings through Cowen. 
No
 shares were sold under this agreement during the year ended 
December 31, 2024.
In May 2021, the Company entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement with Jefferies LLC, or Jefferies, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell shares of the Company’s common stock having an aggregate offering proceeds up to $
350.0
 million, from time to time, in ATM offerings through Jefferies. During the year ended December 31, 2023
, 
there were 
1,175,584
 shares sold under the ATM resulting in net proceeds of $
53.3
 million.
Underwritten Public Offering
In June 2024, the Company completed an underwritten public offering in which 
8,782,051
 shares of common stock were sold, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 
1,346,153
 shares, at a public offering price of $
39.00
 per share. In connection with the offering, the Company sold to certain investors pre-funded warrants, in lieu of common stock, to purchase 
1,538,501
 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $
38.999
 per pre-funded warrant, which equals the public offering price per share of common stock less the $
0.001
 exercise price per share of each pre-funded warrant. The total proceeds that the Company received from the offering were $
381.0
 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions.
The pre-funded warrants were classified as a component of permanent equity in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as they are freestanding financial instruments that are immediately exercisable, do not embody an obligation for the Company to repurchase its own shares and permit the holders to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise. All of the shares underlying the pre-funded warrants have been included in the weighted-average number of shares of common stock used to calculate net loss per share, basic and diluted, attributable to common stockholders because the shares may be issued for little or no

Stock-Based Awards 
Equity Plan Awards
Under the terms of the Company's 2023 Incentive Plan, or 2023 Plan, and Employment Inducement Plan, or Inducement Plan, awards may be granted at an exercise price not less than fair market value. The exercise price of an option may not be less than the fair market value. The term of an award granted under the 2023 Plan and Inducement Plan may not exceed 
ten years
. Typically, the vesting schedule for option grants to employees provides that 
1/4
 of the grant vests upon the first anniversary of the date of grant, with the remainder of the shares vesting monthly thereafter at a rate of 
1/48
 of the total shares subject to the option. Typically, the vesting schedule for RSU grants provides that 
1/4
 of the grant vests upon the annual anniversary of the date of grant over the period of 
four years
.
Under the 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or ESPP, eligible employees may purchase common stock at 
85
% of the lesser of the fair market value of common stock on the offering date or the purchase date with a six-month look-back feature. ESPP purchases are settled with common stock from the ESPP’s previously authorized and available pool of shares. During the year ended 
December 31, 2024
, the Company issued 
200,539
 shares of common stock under the ESPP.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

During the year ended December 31, 2022, PSOs were granted to certain nonexecutive employees. PSOs are subject to vest only if specified operational milestones are achieved and the employees’ continued service with the Company. The Company uses the Black-Scholes method to calculate the fair value at the grant date and is recognizing stock-based compensation expense for the PSOs that are expected to vest. Stock-based compensation for PSOs is recognized over the service period, beginning in the period the Company determines it is probable that a milestone will be achieved. Forfeitures of PSOs are recognized as they occur. The Company reassesses the probability of the performance condition at each reporting period and adjusts the compensation cost based on the probability assessment. As of December 31, 2024, certain operational milestones were deemed probable of achievement. The aggregate intrinsic values of PSOs outstanding, vested and exercisable, and vested and expected to vest were calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the PSOs and the fair value of the Company’s common stock. The total estimated grant date fair value of PSOs vested during the years ended December 31, 2024
 and 2023, was $
9.9
 million and $
3.4
 million, respectively. No PSOs were granted or exercised during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The weighted-average estimated fair value of PSOs granted was $

one
 to 
four years
. The total grant date fair value of the RSUs vested during the years ended December 31, 
2024, 2023, and 2022

The fair value of the PSUs is determined on the grant date based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock, except for certain PSUs with a market vesting condition, for which fair value is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. PSUs are subject to vest only if certain specified criteria are achieved and the employees’ continued service with the Company. For certain PSUs, the number of PSUs that may vest are also subject to the achievement of certain specified criteria, including both performance conditions and market conditions. As of December 31, 2024, certain specified criteria were deemed probable of achievement or already achieved. Stock-based compensation for PSUs is recognized over the service period beginning in the period the Company determines it is probable that the performance criteria will be achieved. The total grant date fair value of the PSUs vested during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022
 was $

2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Capitalized stock-based compensation is recognized as cost of sales when the related product is sold.

As of December 31, 2024
, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested equity awards, net of estimated forfeitures, was $
256.8
 million, which the Company expects to recognize over an estimated weighted-average period of 
2
 years. In determining the estimated fair value of the stock options, PSOs and ESPP, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and assumptions discussed below. Each of these inputs is subjective and generally requires significant judgment to determine.

Expected Term
—The Company’s expected term represents the period that the Company’s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term).

Expected Volatility
—The Company’s expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the look-back period corresponding to the expected term.

Risk-Free Interest Rate
—The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero coupon issues in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of option.

Expected Dividend
—The Company has never paid dividends on its common stock and has no plans to pay dividends on its common stock. Therefore, the Company used an expected dividend yield of zero.

Strike price for options awards and PSOs is equal to the closing market value of our common stock on the date of grant.

The fair value of stock option awards granted was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

The Company has incurred net operating losses since inception. The Company has not reflected any benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards in the accompanying financial statements. The Company has established a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets.
Beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the right to deduct research and development expenditures for tax purposes in the period the expenses were incurred and instead requires all U.S. and foreign research and development expenditures to be amortized over five and 15 tax years, respectively. Due to this required capitalization of research and development expenditures and the significant taxable income generated as a result of our sale of royalties in July 2022, the Company has recorded current state income tax expense of $
6.1
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized an income tax benefit of $
4.8
 million attributable to modifications in its state apportionment methodology, and then offset by an income tax expense of $
3.0
 million from foreign jurisdictions. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized an income tax expense of $
0.2
 million for state tax, and income tax expense of $

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Approximately $
1.3
 million in unrecognized tax benefits would impact the Company’s effective tax rate if recognized. The Company has elected to include interest and penalties as a component of tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized accrued interest and penalties of $
0.1
 million and $
0.2
 million, respectively, as a component of income tax expense. 
No
 accrued interest and penalties were recognized as a component of income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company does not anticipate that the amount of existing unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease during the next year.
It is the Company’s intention to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in their operations. As of December 31, 2024
, the Company had not made a provision for any incremental foreign withholding taxes on approximately $
13.0
 million of the excess of the amount of net income for financial reporting over the tax basis of investments in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. If these earnings were repatriated to the U.S., the deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences would result in a nominal amount of withholding taxes.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal, 40 state tax jurisdictions, and ten foreign countries. The federal and state income tax returns from inception to December 31, 2024
 remain subject to examination.
