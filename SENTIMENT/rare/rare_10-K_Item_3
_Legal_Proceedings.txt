 Legal Proceedings

Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. and Baylor Research Institute v. Navinta LLC, Aurobindo Pharma Limited, Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc., Esjay Pharma Private Limited and Esjay Pharma LLC

On September 26, 2024, we filed a patent infringement suit under the Hatch-Waxman Act against Navinta, Aurobindo and Esjay in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The suit is in response to notices from Navinta, Aurobindo, and Esjay concerning the filing of ANDAs with the FDA, seeking FDA approval to market a generic version of Dojolvi® (triheptanoin) along with Paragraph IV certifications which allege that one Orange Book-listed patent covering Dojolvi is invalid, unenforceable, and/or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the proposed generic product. The filing of the suit triggers a stay preventing the FDA from granting the ANDAs final approval, which stay extends to December 30, 2027 (i.e., the date that is seven and one-half years from the June 30, 2020 approval of Dojolvi). We intend to vigorously defend our intellectual property. In addition to the issued patents for Dojolvi listed in the Orange Book, we own a pending patent application relating to certain pharmaceutical compositions of triheptanoin, including Dojolvi, that would be expected to expire in 2034 upon an issuance. Dojolvi is also protected in the U.S. by regulatory exclusivity until 2025 and orphan drug exclusivity for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with molecularly confirmed long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD) until 2027.

Aurobindo and Navinta answered the complaint on December 2, 2024 and December 30, 2024, respectively. Esjay filed a motion to dismiss the suit on December 2, 2024. We filed an opposition to Esjay’s motion to dismiss on January 7, 2025.

Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. v. Catalent Maryland, Inc. and Catalent Pharma Solutions LLC

On October 9, 2024, we filed a suit against Catalent Maryland, Inc. and Catalent Pharma Solutions, LLC (collectively, Catalent) in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware alleging that Catalent fraudulently mispresented its manufacturing capabilities and serially breached the terms of its manufacturing agreement with us. Our suit seeks monetary damages from Catalent in excess of $100 million.

Catalent filed its response, which included a motion to dismiss the fraud claim alleged in the suit, on December 18, 2024. We filed an amended complaint in reply to Catalent’s response on February 3, 2025.

Except as disclosed above, we are not currently a party to any other material legal proceedings. We may, however, in the ordinary course of business face various claims brought by third parties or government regulators and, from time to time, make claims or take legal actions to assert our rights, including claims relating to our directors, officers, stockholders, intellectual property rights, employment matters and the safety or efficacy of our products. Any of these claims could subject us to costly litigation and, while we generally believe that we have adequate insurance to cover many different types of liabilities, our insurance carriers may deny coverage, may be inadequately capitalized to pay on valid claims, or our policy limits may be inadequate to fully satisfy any damage awards or settlements. If this were to happen, the payment of any such awards could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operations, cash flows and financial position. Additionally, any such claims, whether or not successful, could damage our reputation and business.
