CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Quarterly Report”) contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things,
our plans, strategies and prospects, both business and financial. These statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management.
Although we believe that our plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by these forward-looking statements are reasonable,
we cannot provide assurance that we will achieve or realize these plans, intentions or expectations. Forward-looking statements are inherently
subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Generally, statements that are not historical facts, including statements concerning
possible or assumed future actions, business strategies, events or results of operations, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,”
“believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,”
“may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,”
“should,” “would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words
does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Investors should read statements that contain these words carefully because they
discuss future expectations, contain projects of future results of operations or financial condition; or state other “forward-looking”
information. Forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this Quarterly Report and may involve significant
judgments and assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside our control. There
may be events in the future that management is not able to predict accurately or over which we have no control. We do not undertake any
obligation to update to otherwise correct any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the
date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events, inaccuracies that become apparent after the date hereof or
otherwise, except as may be required under applicable laws. The risk factors and cautionary language contained in this Quarterly Report
provide examples of risks, uncertainties, and events that may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations described
in such forward-looking statements, including, among other things:

●

our ability to grow and
    manage future growth profitably over time, maintain relationships with customers, compete within our industry and retain key employees;

●

the possibility that we
    may be adversely impacted by economic, business, and/or competitive factors;

●

our limited operating history
    makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects;

●

our recent and rapid growth
    may not be indicative of future performance;

●

we may not continue to
    grow or maintain our active user base, and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability;

●

risks relating to our ability
    to attract new advertisers, or the potential loss of existing advertisers or the reduction of or failure by existing advertisers
    to maintain or increase their advertising budgets;

●

our cloud business may
    not achieve success, and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected;

●

negative media campaigns
    may adversely impact our financial performance, results of operations, and relationships with our business partners, including content
    creators and advertisers;

●

spam activity, including
    inauthentic and fraudulent user activity, if undetected, may contribute, from time to time, to some amount of overstatement
    of our performance indicators;

●

we collect, store, and
    process large amounts of user video content and personal information of our users and subscribers. If our security measures are breached,
    our sites and applications may be perceived as not being secure, traffic and advertisers may curtail or stop viewing our content
    or using our services, our business and operating results could be harmed, and we could face governmental investigations and legal
    claims from users and subscribers;

●

our bitcoin treasury strategy
    exposes us to various risks associated with holding bitcoin;

ii

●

the operation of our crypto
    wallet exposes us to significant regulatory, operational, security, and market risks that could adversely affect our business, financial
    condition, results of operations, and reputation;

●

we may fail to comply with
    applicable privacy laws, subjecting us to liability and damages;

●

we are exposed to significant
    regulatory, operational, compliance, privacy, and legal risks related to age verification and child online safety laws implemented
    in various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions;

●

our cloud services business
    operates in a highly regulated environment, subject to a complex and rapidly evolving array of domestic and international laws, regulations,
    and industry standards governing data privacy, cybersecurity, data localization, and cross-border data transfers;

●

we are subject to cybersecurity
    risks and interruptions or failures in our information technology systems and as we grow and gain recognition, we will likely need
    to expend additional resources to enhance our protection from such risks. Notwithstanding our efforts, a cyber incident could occur
    and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss;

●

we may be found to have
    infringed on the intellectual property of others, which could expose us to substantial losses or restrict our operations;

●

we may face liability for
    hosting a variety of tortious or unlawful materials uploaded by third parties, notwithstanding the liability protections of Section
    230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (“Section 230”);

●

we may face negative publicity
    for removing, or declining to remove, certain content, regardless of whether such content violated any law;

●

paid endorsements by our
    content creators may expose us to regulatory risk, liability, and compliance costs, and, as a result, may adversely affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations;

●

our traffic growth, engagement,
    and monetization depend upon effective operation within and compatibility with operating systems, networks, devices, web browsers
    and standards, including mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control;

●

our business depends on
    continued and unimpeded access to our content and services on the internet. If we or those who engage with our content experience
    disruptions in internet service, or if internet service providers are able to block, degrade or charge for access to our content
    and services, we could incur additional expenses and the loss of traffic and advertisers;

●

we face significant market
    competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors for traffic and advertising spend, our business and
    operating results could be harmed;

●

we rely on data from third
    parties to calculate certain of our performance metrics. Real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and
    negatively affect our business;

●

changes to our existing
    content and services could fail to attract traffic and advertisers or fail to generate revenue;

●

we derive the majority
    of our revenue from advertising. The failure to attract new advertisers, the loss of existing advertisers, or the reduction of or
    failure by existing advertisers to maintain or increase their advertising budgets would adversely affect our business;

●

we depend on third-party
    vendors, including internet service providers, advertising networks, and data centers, to provide core services;

●

hosting and delivery costs
    may increase unexpectedly;

iii

●

we have offered and intend
    to continue to offer incentives, including economic incentives, to content creators to join our platform, and these arrangements
    may involve fixed payment obligations that are not contingent on actual revenue or performance metrics generated by the applicable
    content creator but rather are based on our modeled financial projections for that creator, which if not satisfied may adversely
    impact our financial performance, results of operations and liquidity;

●

we may be unable to develop
    or maintain effective internal controls;

●

we have identified material
    weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. If we are unable to remediate these material
    weaknesses, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations;

●

potential diversion of
    management’s attention and consumption of resources as a result of acquisitions of other companies and success in integrating
    and otherwise achieving the benefits of recent and potential acquisitions;

●

we may fail to maintain
    adequate operational and financial resources or raise additional capital or generate sufficient cash flows;

●

changes in tax rates, changes
    in tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce, the adoption of new tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities
    may adversely impact our financial results;

●

compliance obligations
    imposed by new privacy laws, laws regulating online video sharing platforms, other online platforms, and online speech in certain
    jurisdictions in which we operate, or industry practices may adversely affect our business;

●

the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of our business combination agreement with Northern Data AG (“Northern Data”) could adversely affect our future business;

●

our business could be adversely impacted by uncertainty related to the proposed business combination with Northern Data, whether or not the business combination is completed;

●

the anticipated benefits of the proposed business combination with Northern Data may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected; and

●

other
risks and uncertainties indicated in this Quarterly Report and in other filings that we have made or will make with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including the risk factors described under the caption “Risk Factors” in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Overview
and Basis of Presentation

Nature
of Operations

Rumble
Inc. (“Rumble” or the “Company”) is a high growth, video sharing platform and cloud services provider designed
to help content creators manage, distribute, and monetize their content by connecting them with brands, publishers, and directly to their
subscribers and followers. The Company’s registered office is located at 444 Gulf of Mexico Drive, Longboat Key, Florida, 34228.
The Company’s shares of Class A common stock and warrants are traded on The Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) under the
symbol “RUM” and “RUMBW”, respectively.

Basis
of Presentation

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements (the “financial statements”) are prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the results of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative
guidance found in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”). All
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. These financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars,
which is the functional currency of the Company.

These
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2024 (the “Annual Financial Statements”). These financial statements have been prepared using the same accounting
policies that were described in Note 2 to the Annual Financial Statements.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of these financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments, and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as of
the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing
basis, the Company evaluates the estimates used, which include but are not limited to: allowance for credit losses; valuation of share-based
compensation awards; estimates in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions;
fair value of financial instruments including digital assets, contingent consideration, warrant liability, and derivative; discount rate
in determining lease liabilities; valuation of long-lived assets and their associated useful lives, valuation of goodwill; the realization
of tax assets, estimates of tax liabilities, and valuation of deferred taxes; and estimates in the determination of the fair value of
non-cash consideration earned in trade and barter transactions. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions are reviewed periodically
and the impact of any revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which such revisions are made. Actual results
could differ materially from those estimates, judgments, or assumptions, and such differences could be material to the Company’s
consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Digital
Assets

The
Company’s digital assets consist solely of our investment in bitcoin. We retain ownership of and control over our digital assets
and use third-party custodial services to secure it. The cost basis of our digital assets is calculated using the first-in, first-out
(FIFO) method.

Digital
assets purchased are initially recorded at cost, including capitalizing any transaction costs or fees, and subsequently, remeasured at
fair value based on the exchange quoted price each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized on the condensed consolidated
interim statements of operations.

Trade
and Barter Transactions

The
Company engages in trade and barter transactions whereby the Company and its counterparty exchange media campaigns or other promotional
services. The Company reviews each transaction to ensure the advertising it receives has economic substance and records revenue in an
amount equal to the fair value of the products and services received unless this is not reasonable to estimate, in which case the consideration
is measured based on the standalone selling price of the advertising inventory promised or delivered to the customer. Trade and barter
revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is fulfilled and follows the same pattern of recognition as the Company’s
normal advertising revenue. Trade and barter expense is recorded when goods or services are consumed. Trade and barter revenue was $
1,570,332

and $
1,672,395
 for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Trade and barter expenses were $
nil
 and $
nil
 for
the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Trade and barter revenue was $
1,689,205
 and $
1,672,395
 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. Trade and barter expenses were $
3,000,000
 and $
3,000,000
 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The trade and barter expense is recorded in sales and marketing expense in the condensed
consolidated interim statement of operations.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

The
following amendments to existing standards have been issued up to and including the date of issuance of these financial statements, however
are not yet effective for the Company:

●
Accounting
Standards Update 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. The amendments in this update require that
public business entities on an annual basis (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information
for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent
of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income or loss by the applicable statutory income tax rate). This ASU is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.

●
Accounting
                                            Standards Updates 2025-01 and 2024-03, Income statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income
                                            – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement
                                            Expense. The amendments in this update require public business entities to disclose, on an
                                            annual and interim basis, disaggregated information about certain income statement expense
                                            line items in the notes to the financial statements. Public business entities are required
                                            to apply the guidance prospectively and may elect to apply it retrospectively. This ASU is
                                            effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods within fiscal
                                            years beginning after December 15, 2027.

Accounting
                                            Standards Updates 2025-05, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement
                                            of Credit Losses for Accounts Receivable and Contract Assets. This ASU provides all entities
                                            with a practical expedient to assume that current conditions as of the balance sheet date
                                            do not change for the remaining life of the assets. This ASU is effective for fiscal years
                                            beginning after December 15, 2025, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
                                            adoption is permitted in both interim and annual reporting periods in which financial statements
                                            have not yet been issued or made available for issuance.

●
Accounting
                                            Standards Updates 2025-06, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software
                                            (Subtopic 350-40): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Internal-Use Software. This
                                            ASU removes all references to software development project stages so that the guidance is
                                            neutral to different software development methods, including methods that entities may use
                                            to develop software in the future. Therefore, this ASU requires that an entity capitalize
                                            software costs when both: management has authorized and committed to funding the software
                                            project; and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used
                                            to perform the function intended (referred to as the “probable-to-complete recognition
                                            threshold”). In evaluating the probable-to-complete recognition threshold, an entity
                                            is required to consider whether there is significant uncertainty associated with the development
                                            activities of the software. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
                                            15, 2027, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption
                                            is permitted as of the beginning of an annual reporting period.

The
Company is still evaluating the potential impact of implementing the above amendments to its consolidated financial statements.

Derivative
Liability

On
December 20, 2024, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement (the “Transaction Agreement”) for
a strategic investment of $
775
 million (the “Transaction”) from Tether Investments Limited (n/k/a Tether Investments S.A.
de C.V.) (“Tether”) in exchange for 
103,333,333
 shares of Class A Common Stock. The Class A Common Stock has a par value
of $
0.0001
 per share. The purchase price of the Class A Common Stock in the Transaction was $
7.50
 per share.

In
connection with the Transaction Agreement, the Company executed support agreements with certain members of key management to provide
a backstop to the anticipated tender offer and ensure 
70,000,000
 shares would be tendered and available for repurchase when the Transaction
closed.

On
January 3, 2025, the Company commenced a tender offer to purchase up to 
70,000,000
 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock
using proceeds from the Transaction.

The
Company accounted for the Transaction and support agreements as one unit of account, which met the definition of a derivative.

On
February 7, 2025, the Transaction closed, which resulted in the Company settling the derivative by issuing 
103,333,333
 shares to Tether
in exchange for $
775,000,000
 in cash proceeds and repurchasing 
70,000,000
 shares from existing shareholders for $
525,000,000
 in cash.
The net proceeds of $
250,000,000
, together with the fair value of the derivative on that date of $
174,999,998
, were recorded in additional
paid-in capital, net of transaction costs of $
29,429,791
. The Company recognized a gain on fair value of the derivative of $
nil
 and $
9,700,000

during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025.

10.
Other
Liability

The
Company has received certain amounts from a third party to assist with certain operating expenditures of the Company. These amounts are
to be repaid upon settlement of those expenditures, are non-interest bearing, and have been treated as a long-term liability. As of September
30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, an amount of $
500,000
 related to these expenses was recorded in other liability.

Compensation Expense (Continued)

Employee
Stock Purchase Plan

The
first offering period of the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan began on January 1, 2025. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan
allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock at a discount through payroll deductions of
up to 
15
%, subject to any plan limitations. The Employee Stock Purchase Plan provides for six-month offering periods. The offering periods
are scheduled to start on the first trading day on or after January 1 and July 1, and end on the last trading day on or before June 30
and December 31, respectively. Employees are able to purchase shares at 
90
% of the lower of the fair market value of the Company’s
Class A Common Stock on the first trading day of the offering period or the last trading day of the purchase period.

The
fair value of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan was determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The following table reflects

Loss
per Share

When
taken together, an ExchangeCo Share and a share of Class C Common Stock are economically similar to a share of Class A Common Stock.
As a result, the Company computed basic loss per share by dividing net loss attributable to the Company by the weighted-average number
of Class A and ExchangeCo Shares issued and outstanding, excluding those held in escrow, as these are contingently issuable shares and
have been excluded from the calculation during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, and 2024. Shares of Class D Common
Stock do not share in earnings and are not participating securities (i.e., non-economic shares) and therefore, have been excluded from
the calculation of weighted-average number of shares outstanding.

Diluted
loss per share is computed giving effect to all potentially dilutive shares. Diluted loss per share for all periods presented is the
same as basic loss per share as the inclusion of potentially issuable shares would be antidilutive.

14.
Commitments
and Contingencies

Commitments

The
Company has non-cancelable contractual commitments of approximately $
38
 million as of September 30, 2025, which are primarily related
to programming and content, leases, and other service arrangements. The majority of commitments will be paid over two years commencing
in 2025.

Legal
Proceedings

In
the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions in services and products, the Company indemnifies certain parties. The Company
has agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual
property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification
claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its officers
and directors, and its bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to its agents.

Furthermore,
many of the Company’s agreements with its customers and partners require the Company to indemnify them for certain intellectual
property infringement claims against them, which would increase costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay
significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Customers and partners may discontinue the use of the Company’s
services and technologies as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact the business.

It
is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique
facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. As of September 30, 2025, there were no material indemnification claims
that were probable or reasonably possible.

As
of September 30, 2025, Rumble was defending a lawsuit against the Company and one of its shareholders seeking a variety of relief, including
rescission of a share redemption sale agreement with the Company or damages alleged to be worth approximately $
419.0
 million.

The
Company is defending the claims and considers the likelihood that it will be required to make a payment to plaintiffs to be remote.

of our bitcoin investment based on an exchanged quoted price. Refer to Note 5.

Warrant
Liability

Warrant
liability consists of warrants issued by the Company in public offerings, private placements, and forward purchase contracts. As of September
30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the number of warrants outstanding was 
8,046,073
 and 
8,046,076
, respectively, with a weighted-average
exercise price of $
11.50
. The warrants are exercisable and will expire on September 16, 2027, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.
All warrants are publicly traded.

Derivative
Liability 

The
derivative liability relates to the net new shares from the Tether transaction. As of the settlement date on February 7, 2025, the fair
value of the derivative was $
174,999,998
, determined as the difference between the value of the net new shares based on the settlement
date share price of $
12.75
 and the forward price of $
7.50
.

16.
Credit
and Concentration Risks

Credit
risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an
obligation. The Company is exposed to credit risk resulting from the possibility that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument
defaults on their financial obligations or if there is a concentration of transactions carried out with the same counterparty. Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable.

The
Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held in reputable banks in its country of domicile and management believes the risk of
loss to be remote. We maintain cash balances that exceed the insured limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Canada
Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Subsequent
Events

On November 10, 2025, the Company signed
a business combination agreement with Northern Data AG (“Northern Data”), a German stock corporation (
Aktiengesellschaft
)
incorporated under the laws of Germany. Subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement, the Company will submit a voluntary public
exchange offer to all shareholders of Northern Data. Each Northern Data stockholder that tenders will receive 
2.0281
 newly issued Class
A Rumble shares in exchange for each Northern Data share (the “Exchange Ratio”) (with customary settlement mechanisms for
fractional shares).

Tether, along with shareholders affiliated
with Northern Data’s co-CEO and another significant shareholder, collectively representing 
72
% of the outstanding shares of Northern
Data, have committed to exchange their Northern Data shares at the same Exchange Ratio that applies to the exchange offer, contemporaneously
with the closing of the exchange offer.

The acceptance period is expected to
commence in the second quarter of 2026, and the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2026, subject to satisfaction
of closing conditions and regulatory approvals.

In addition to the business combination,
the Company has entered into a significant GPU agreement with Tether, representing an initial commitment by Tether to purchase up to $
150

million of GPU services over a two-year period following the closing of our voluntary public exchange offer for Northern Data.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Rumble Inc.’s
(“Rumble” or the “Company”) unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and the related notes
included in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements and related
notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. This discussion contains forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements. Factors
that could cause or contribute to those differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the
sections titled “1A. Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” included elsewhere
in this Quarterly Report and those discussed in our other filings with the SEC. Additionally, our historical results are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected in any future period. Amounts are presented in U.S. dollars.

Overview

We
are a high growth, video sharing and cloud services provider platform designed to help content creators manage, distribute, and monetize
their content by connecting them with brands, publishers, and directly to their subscribers and followers. Our registered office is 444
Gulf of Mexico Drive, Longboat Key, Florida, 34228. Our shares of Class A common stock and warrants are traded on The Nasdaq Global Market
(“Nasdaq”) under the symbols “RUM” and “RUMBW”, respectively.

Significant
Events and Transactions

On
December 20, 2024, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement for a strategic investment of $775 million from
Tether, the largest company in the digital assets industry and the most widely used dollar stablecoin across the world. The transaction
closed on February 7, 2025, with Tether purchasing 103,333,333 shares of Class A common stock at a price per share of $7.50, totaling
$775 million in gross proceeds to Rumble. As part of the closing of the transaction, the Company completed a tender offer to purchase
70,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock at a price of $7.50 per share (the “Tender Offer”) for a total of $525 million,
excluding fees and expenses related to the Tender Offer. The Company will use $250 million of the proceeds, less transaction costs, to
support growth initiatives.

ended December 31, 2024 (the “Annual Financial Statements”)

28

Expenses

Expenses
primarily include cost of services, general and administrative, research and development, sales and marketing, acquisition-related transaction
costs, amortization and depreciation, change in fair value of digital assets, and changes in fair value of contingent consideration.
The most significant components of our expenses on an ongoing basis are programming and content, service provider costs, and staffing-related
costs.

We
expect to continue to invest substantial resources to support our growth and anticipate that each of the following categories of expenses
will increase in absolute dollar amounts for the foreseeable future.

Cost
of Services (Exclusive of Amortization and Depreciation)

Cost
of services consists of costs related to obtaining, supporting and hosting the Company’s product offerings. These costs primarily
include:

●
Programming
                                            and content costs related to compensation, including share-based compensation, from whom
                                            video and other content are licensed. These costs are paid to these providers based on revenues
                                            generated or in fixed amounts. In certain circumstances, we incur additional costs related
                                            to incentivizing top content creators to promote and join our platform; and

●
Other
                                            cost of services, such as third-party service provider costs, including data center and networking
                                            costs, as well as payment processing fees and costs paid to publishers.

General
and Administrative Expenses

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses, which include bonuses and share-based compensation for
our executives and certain other employees. General and administrative expenses also include legal and professional fees, business insurance
costs, operating lease costs and other costs. As a public company, we expect to continue to incur material costs related to compliance
with applicable laws and regulations, including audit and accounting fees, legal, insurance, investor relations and other costs.

Research
and Development Expenses

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses, which include bonuses and share-based compensation for our
employees on our engineering and development teams. Research and development expenses also include consultant fees related to our development
activities to originate, develop and enhance our platforms.

Sales
and Marketing Expenses

Sales
and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses, which include bonuses and share-based compensation for our
employees associated with our sales and marketing functions. Sales and marketing expenses also include consultant fees and direct marketing
costs related to the promotion of our platforms and solutions. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase over time as we
promote our platform and brand, increase marketing activities, and grow domestic and international operations.

Acquisition-related
Transaction Costs

Acquisition-related
transaction costs consist of professional fees and other expenses incurred in connection with acquisition-related initiatives.

Amortization
and Depreciation

Amortization
and depreciation represent the recognition of costs of assets used in operations, including property and equipment and intangible assets,
over their estimated service lives.

29

Change
in Fair Value of Digital Assets 

Changes
in fair value of digital assets reflect gains or losses arising from the remeasurement of our bitcoin investment.

Change
in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration 

Certain
contingent consideration associated with the Callin acquisition does not meet the criteria for equity classification, and must be recorded
as a liability in accordance with guidance contained in ASC 815-40, 
Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity

(“ASC 815-40”). Because the contingent consideration meets the definition of a liability under ASC 815, 
Derivatives and
Hedging 
(“ASC 815”), it is measured at fair value at inception and at each reporting date in accordance with the guidance
in ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurement 
(“ASC 820”), with any subsequent changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated
statement of operations in the applicable period of change

Non-Operating
Income and Other Items

Interest
Income 

Interest
income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. We invest in highly liquid securities such
as money market funds, treasury bills and term deposits.

Other
Income (Expense)

Other
income (expense) consists of miscellaneous income earned and expenses incurred outside of the normal course of business as well as foreign
exchange gains and losses on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

Change
in Fair Value of Warrant Liability 

We
account for our outstanding warrants in accordance with ASC 815-40, under which the warrants issued in connection with the Business Combination
do not meet the criteria for equity classification, and must be recorded as liabilities. As these warrants meet the definition of a liability
under ASC 815, they are measured at fair value at inception and at each reporting date in accordance with the guidance in ASC 820, with
any subsequent changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the applicable period of change.

Change
in Fair Value of Derivative

The
forward purchase contracts in connection with the Tether transaction do not meet the criteria for equity classification and must be recorded
as a liability in accordance with guidance contained in ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (“ASC
815-40”). Because the derivative meets the definition of a liability under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”),
it is measured at fair value at inception and at each reporting date in accordance with the guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement
(“ASC 820”), with any subsequent changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the applicable
period of change.

Income
Tax (Expense) Benefit

Income
tax (expense) benefit consists of the estimated federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred in the U.S. and other jurisdictions
in which we operate.

Key
Business Metrics

To
analyze our business performance, determine financial forecasts and help develop long-term strategic plans, we review the key business
metrics described below.

Monthly
Active Users (“MAUs”)

We
use MAUs as a measure of audience engagement to help us understand the volume of users engaged with our content on a monthly basis. MAUs
represent the total web, mobile app, and connected TV users of Rumble for each month, which allows us to measure our total user base
calculated from data provided by Google, a third-party analytics provider. Google defines “active users” as the “[n]umber
of distinct users who visited your website or application.”
1
 We have used the Google analytics systems since we first
began publicly reporting MAU statistics, and the resulting data have not been independently verified.

As
of July 1, 2023, Universal Analytics (“UA”), Google’s analytics platform on which we historically relied for calculating
MAUs using company-set parameters, was phased out by Google and ceased processing data. At that time, Google Analytics 4 (“GA4”)
succeeded UA as Google’s next-generation analytics platform, which has been used to determine MAUs since the third quarter of 2023
and which we expect to continue to use to determine MAUs in future periods. Although Google has disclosed certain information regarding
the transition to GA4,
2
 Google does not currently make available sufficient information relating to its new GA4 algorithm
for us to determine the full effect of the switch from UA to GA4 on our reported MAUs. Because Google has publicly stated that metrics
in UA “may be more or less similar” to metrics in GA4, and that “[i]t is not unusual for there to be apparent discrepancies”
between the two systems,
3
 we are unable to determine whether the transition from UA to GA4 has had a positive or negative
effect, or the magnitude of such effect, if any, on our reported MAUs. It is therefore possible that MAUs that we reported based on the
UA methodology (“MAUs (UA)”) for periods prior to July 1, 2023, cannot be meaningfully compared to MAUs based on the GA4
methodology (“MAUs (GA4)”) in subsequent periods.

MAUs
(GA4) represent the total web, mobile app, and connected TV users of Rumble for each month,
4
 which allows us to measure our
total user base calculated from data provided by Google.
5
 Connected TV users were not counted within MAUs within MAUs (UA)
for periods prior to July 1, 2023, and we believe the number of such users was immaterial in those prior periods. We also believe that
fewer than 1 million MAUs in the current period are from connected TV, making them similarly immaterial. Google’s parameters for
measuring “active users” appear to exclude many, but not all, users who access content on Rumble through “embedded”
videos on domains other than rumble.com, and we are unable to determine the exact number of users who access “embedded” content
within our total number of MAUs. In addition, MAUs (GA4) may rely on statistical sampling and may be based on estimates of data that
Google is missing “due to factors such as cookie consent.”
6
 In general, the implementation of a cookie consent
banner, which is required under the laws of certain jurisdictions, may disproportionately affect certain user demographics or geographic
regions, potentially leading to uneven reporting of MAUs.

As
with our earlier MAU reporting, there is a potential for minor overlap in the resulting data due to users who access Rumble’s content
through the web, our mobile apps, and connected TVs in a given measurement period; however, given that we believe this minor overlap
to be immaterial, we do not separately track or report “unique users” as distinct from MAUs. Our reported MAUs have not historically
included users of Locals. However, starting in mid-May 2024, Locals users began using Rumble’s single sign-on technology to access
their accounts, which we expect will reduce the number of Locals users not included in our MAU reporting. We also do not separately report
the number of users who register for accounts in any given period, which is different from MAUs.

According

Like
many other major online platforms, we rely on significant paid advertising in order to attract users to our platform; however, we cannot
be certain that all or substantially all activity that results from such advertising is genuine. Spam activity, including inauthentic
and fraudulent user activity, if undetected, may contribute to some amount of overstatement of our performance indicators, including
reporting of MAUs by Google. We continually seek to improve our ability to estimate the total number of spam-generated users, and we
eliminate material activity that is substantially likely to be spam from the calculation of our MAUs. We will not, however, succeed in
identifying and removing all spam.

Our
MAUs (GA4) were 47 million on average in the third quarter of 2025, a decrease of 8% from the second quarter of 2025. We believe that
the decrease continues to be in part the result of a slowdown of news and political commentary outside of a U.S. election cycle, combined
with seasonality related to content creators who do not create content during the summer months.

Average
Revenue Per User (“ARPU”)

We
use ARPU as a measure of our ability to monetize our user base. Quarterly ARPU is calculated as quarterly Audience Monetization revenue
divided by MAUs for the relevant quarter (as reported by Google Analytics). ARPU does not include Other Initiatives revenue.

ARPU
was $0.45 in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 7% from the second quarter of 2025. The increase from the second quarter of 2025
is attributable to similar audience monetization revenue that came from fewer MAUs.

32

We
regularly review, have adjusted in the past, and may in the future adjust our processes for calculating our key business metrics to improve
their accuracy, including through the application of new data or technologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously
undetected spam activity. As a result of such adjustments, our key business metrics may not be comparable period-over-period.

Revenues

Revenues
decreased by $0.3 million to $24.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended September
30, 2024, of which $0.5 million was attributable to a reduction in Audience Monetization revenues, offset by a $0.2 million increase
in Other Initiatives revenues. The decrease in Audience Monetization revenues was due to a $4.9 million reduction in advertising revenue,
offset by a $3.7 million increase in subscription fees as well as $0.7 million from licensing, tipping fees, and platform hosting fees.
We are continuing to see progress in the uptake of new brands, but we are still at the early stages of that process. The increase in
Other Initiatives revenue was due to a $0.1 million increase in cloud services offered and a $0.1 million increase in advertising inventory
being monetized by our publisher network.

Cost
of Services

Cost
of services decreased by $11.2 million to $25.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2024. The decrease was due to a reduction in programming and content costs of $11.9 million, offset by an increase in other
costs of services of $0.7 million.

General
and Administrative Expenses

General
and administrative expenses increased by $0.8 million to $10.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was driven by a $1.2 million rise in administrative expenses, reflecting higher professional
fees and other administrative services, offset by a decrease in payroll and related expenses of $0.4 million.

Research
and Development Expenses

Research
and development expenses decreased by $0.2 million to $4.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease resulted from a $0.2 million in costs associated with computer software, hardware, and
other expenditures used in research and development-related activities.

Sales
and Marketing Expenses

Sales
and marketing expenses increased by $1.1 million to $5.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due to a rise in marketing and public relations activities of $0.9 million and an increase
in payroll and related expenses of $0.2 million.

Acquisition-related
Transaction Costs 

Acquisition-related
transaction costs increased by $5.2 million to $5.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2024. The increase was driven by professional fees and other expenses incurred in connection with acquisition-related
initiatives. These costs reflect the Company’s continued evaluation of strategic opportunities to support growth.

Amortization
and Depreciation

Amortization
and depreciation increased by $0.8 million to $3.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due to an increase of $0.3 million from depreciation on our property and equipment as we continue
to build out our infrastructure, as well as an increase in amortization from intangible assets of $0.5 million.

34

Change
in Fair Value of Digital Assets

Change
in fair value of digital assets expense decreased by $1.5 million to $1.5 million, resulting in a gain of $1.5 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024. The change in fair value of digital assets reflects
the remeasurement of our Bitcoin investment to its fair value at each reporting period. There were no investments in Bitcoin during the
three months ended September 30, 2024.

Interest
Income 

Interest
income increased by $0.9 million to $2.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended September
30, 2024. The increase was due to the Company’s investment in money market funds, treasury bills and term deposits.

Other
Income (Expense) 

Other
income increased by $47.2 thousand to $46.9 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2024. The increase was driven by foreign currency rate fluctuations, as the majority of our cash balance was held in U.S.
dollars, our functional currency, as of September 30, 2025.

Change
in Fair Value of Warrant Liability

Change
in fair value of warrant liability increased by $9.7 million, resulting in a gain of $8.9 million in the three months ended September
30, 2025. The warrant liability arose in connection with the warrants offered as part of the Business Combination. As these warrants
meet the classification of a financial liability in accordance with ASC 815-40, the related warrant liability is measured at its fair
value, determined in accordance with ASC 820, at each reporting period. The fair value of this warrant liability was measured using the
fair value of the Company’s warrants listed on the Nasdaq. The decrease in the change in fair value of warrant liability is directly
attributable to changes in the trading price of Rumble’s warrants.

Income
Tax Expense

Income
tax expense decreased by $85.2 thousand to $nil in the three months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended September
30, 2024.

Revenues

Revenues
increased by $8.3 million to $73.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended September 30,
2024, of which $5.8 million was attributable to an increase in Audience Monetization revenues, in addition to higher Other Initiatives
revenues of $2.5 million. The increase in Audience Monetization revenues was driven by $11.8 million in higher subscription fees and
$2.5 million from licensing, tipping fees, and platform hosting fees, offset by an $8.5 million decrease in advertising. We are continuing
to see progress in the uptake of new brands, but we are still at the early stages of that process. The increase in Other Initiative revenue
was due to a $1.2 million increase in cloud services offered and a $1.3 million increase in advertising inventory being monetized by
our publisher network.

Cost
of Services

Cost
of services decreased by $22.2 million to $81.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. The decrease was due to a reduction in programming and content costs of $25.1 million, offset by an increase in other
costs of services of $2.9 million.

General
and Administrative Expenses

General
and administrative expenses increased by $9.3 million to $38.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due to an increase of $5.4 million in payroll and related expenses and $3.9 million
in other administrative expenses. The increase in payroll and related expense is driven by: a one-time $4.8 million increase in compensation
costs related to the departures of an executive and director; a one-time $2.3 million increase in payroll taxes associated with stock
options exercised related to the tender offer stemming from the strategic investment from Tether; and an increase in share-based compensation
related to previously and newly granted restricted stock units and stock options for certain employees and executives; offset by a $2.3
million decrease in share-based compensation related to the recognition of contingent shares issued in connection with the Callin acquisition
that were accounted for as a post-combination expense. The increase in other administrative expenses of $3.9 million was due to a rise
in expenses related to public company-related costs, including legal, accounting, and other administrative services.

36

Research
and Development Expenses

Research
and development expenses decreased by $0.4 million to $14.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease resulted from a $0.6 million reduction in costs associated with computer software,
hardware, and other expenditures used in research and development-related activities, offset by an increase in payroll and related expenses
of $0.2 million.

Sales
and Marketing Expenses

Sales
and marketing expenses increased by $3.1 million to $16.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. The increase was due to a rise in marketing and public relations activities of $2.7 million and an increase
in payroll and related expenses of $1.0 million, offset by a reduction in consulting services of $0.6 million.

Acquisition-related
Transaction Costs 

Acquisition-related
transaction costs increased by $7.6 million to $7.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily driven by professional fees and other expenses incurred in connection with acquisition-related
initiatives. These costs reflect the Company’s continued evaluation of strategic opportunities to support growth.

Amortization
and Depreciation

Amortization
and depreciation increased by $1.7 million to $10.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2024. The increase was due to an increase of $1.3 million from depreciation on our property and equipment as we continue
to build out our infrastructure, as well as an increase in amortization from intangible assets of $0.4 million.

Change
in Fair Value of Digital Assets

Change
in fair value of digital assets expense decreased by $4.9 million to $4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared
to the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The change in fair value of digital assets reflects the remeasurement of our Bitcoin investment
to its fair value at each reporting period. There were no investments in Bitcoin during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Change
in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration

Change
in fair value of contingent consideration decreased by $1.4 million to $nil for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. The contingent
consideration liability arose in connection with the Callin acquisition and the fair value of this contingent consideration was measured
using the fair value of the expected number of shares to be issued and the Company’s share price at closing. The change in fair
value of contingent consideration for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was directly attributable to changes in the Company’s
share price since the closing and the probability of contingencies being met. No comparable change occurred following the derecognition
and reclassification of the contingent consideration to equity on May 15, 2024.

Interest
Income 

Interest
income increased by $1.3 million to $8.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2024. The increase was due to the Company’s investment in money market funds, treasury bills and term deposits.

37

Other
Expense

Other
expenses decreased by $73.4 thousand to an immaterial amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was driven by foreign currency rate fluctuations, as the majority of our cash balance was held
in U.S. dollars, our functional currency, as of September 30, 2025.

Change
in Fair Value of Warrant Liability

Change
in fair value of warrant liability increased by $25.9 million, resulting in a gain of $24.4 million in the nine months ended September
30, 2025. The warrant liability arose in connection with the warrants offered as part of the Business Combination. As these warrants
meet the classification of a financial liability in accordance with ASC 815-40, the related warrant liability is measured at its fair
value, determined in accordance with ASC 820, at each reporting period. The fair value of this warrant liability was measured using the
fair value of the Company’s warrants listed on the Nasdaq. The increase in the change in fair value of warrant liability is directly
attributable to changes in the trading price of Rumble’s warrants.

Change
in Fair Value of Derivative

Change
in fair value of derivative increased by $9.7 million, resulting in a gain of $9.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2025.
The derivative arose in connection with the forward purchase contracts related to the Tether transaction. As the forward purchase contracts
meet the classification of a financial liability in accordance with ASC 815-40, the related derivative is measured at its fair value,
determined in accordance with ASC 820, at each reporting period. The fair value of this forward purchase contract was measured using
a Monte Carlo simulation methodology that includes simulating the stock price using a risk-neutral Geometric Brownian Motion-based pricing
model. The increase relates to the revaluation of the forward purchase contracts in connection with the Tether transaction.

Income
Tax Expense

Income
tax expense decreased by $35.0 thousand to $31.3 thousand in the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2024.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operating activities and funds previously raised. The primary short-term requirements
for liquidity and capital are to fund general working capital and capital expenditures.

As
of September 30, 2025, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $269.8 million. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit
with banks and amounts held in money market funds, treasury bills, and term deposits.

As
of September 30, 2025, our digital asset holdings were valued at $24.0 million and consisted of 210.82 bitcoin. Our corporate treasury
diversification strategy of allocating a portion of the Company’s excess cash reserves to bitcoin emphasizes our belief in bitcoin
as a valuable tool for strategic planning and is designed to accelerate the Company’s expansion into cryptocurrency.

As
we have consistently stated, we are using a substantial portion of funds to acquire content by providing economic incentives to a small
number of content creators. As of September 30, 2025, we are party to programming and content agreements with a minimum contractual cash
commitment of $32 million. A significant amount of these minimum contractual cash commitments will be paid over 12 to 36 months, commencing
in 2025.

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 primarily consisted of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash
items, including $39.0 million in gains from the changes in fair value of warrants, derivatives and digital assets, partially offset
by a $19.5 million change in share-based compensation, $10.8 million in changes in amortization and depreciation, $1.3 million in changes
in trade and barter revenue and expense, as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in net cash used in operating
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to changes in
net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, offset in part by changes in operating assets and liabilities.

Investing
Activities

Net
cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 consisted of $19.1 million in purchases of digital assets
and $3.8 million in purchases of property plant and equipment and intellectual property. The increase in net cash used in investing activities
during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the investment in digital
assets, offset by a decrease in purchases of property, equipment and intangible assets. Additionally, the cash paid to non-accredited
investors related to the Callin acquisition and cash paid in connection with the North River acquisition in the nine months ended September
30, 2024 contributed to the decrease in net cash used in investing activities.

Financing
Activities

Net
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 consisted of the issuance of $775.0 million in shares
of Class A Common Stock and a corresponding $525.0 million share repurchase completed in connection with the tender offer, both related
to the strategic investment from Tether. The transaction incurred $29.4 million in share issuance costs. Additionally, the net cash provided
by financing activities includes $2.3 million from proceeds related to stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan contributions,
offset by $3.3 million in taxes paid from the net share settlement of share-based compensation. The increase in net cash provided by
financing activities compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to the proceeds from the strategic investment from
Tether as well as the proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan contributions. These inflows were partially
offset by the share repurchases in connection with the tender offer and taxes paid from the net share settlement of share-based compensation.

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures

To
supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial
measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may
be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding
of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented
in accordance with GAAP. We use the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income (loss) excluding interest
income (expense), net, other income (expense), net, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation
expense, acquisition-related transaction costs, change in fair value of warrants, change in fair value of digital assets, change in fair
value of contingent consideration, and change in the fair value of derivative. The Company’s management believes that it is important
to consider Adjusted EBITDA, in addition to net income (loss), as it helps identify trends in our business that could otherwise be masked
by the effect of the gains and losses that are included in net income (loss) but excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.

Adjusted
EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. There
are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA rather than net income (loss), the nearest GAAP equivalent. As a result

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

We
prepare our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements also requires
us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related
disclosures. We evaluate our estimates on a continuous basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management.
To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected.

40

We
believe that the following key accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our unaudited
condensed consolidated interim financial statements. Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important
to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult, subjective or complex
judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, we
believe that these are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.

For
further information on the summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated interim
financial statements, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the Annual Financial Statements.

Share-based
Compensation

The
Company issues equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units to certain of its employees, directors, officers and consultants.
We account for equity awards by recognizing the fair value of share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service
period of the award.

For
equity awards with a service condition, the fair value is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which
takes into account the following inputs: stock price, expected term, volatility, and risk-free interest rate.

For
equity awards with a market condition, the fair value is estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation methodology that
includes simulating the stock price using a risk-neutral Geometric Brownian Motion-based pricing model. Changes in the estimated inputs
or using other option valuation methods may result in materially different option values and share-based compensation expense.

For
equity awards with a performance condition, the Company assesses the likelihood of the performance condition underlying an award being
met and recognizes a share-based compensation expense associated with that award only if it is probable the performance condition will
be met. Where the performance condition underlying an award is a change in control, the Company considers the performance condition to
be probable only when it occurs.

Income
Taxes

The
Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining
our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting
principles and complex tax laws.

Uncertain
tax positions are accounted for using a comprehensive model for the manner in which a company should recognize, measure, present and
disclose in its financial statements all material uncertain income tax positions. The Company reviews its nexus in various tax jurisdictions
and the Company’s tax positions related to all open tax years for events that could change the status of its tax liability, if
any, or require an additional liability to be recorded. Such events may be the resolution of issues raised by a taxing authority, expiration
of the statute of limitations for a prior open tax year or new transactions for which a tax position may be deemed to be uncertain. Those
positions, for which management’s assessment is that there is more than a 50 percent probability of sustaining the position
upon challenge by a taxing authority based upon its technical merits, are subjected to the measurement criteria.

41

Trade
and Barter Transactions

The
Company engages in trade and barter transactions whereby the Company and its counterparty exchange media campaigns or other promotional
services. The Company reviews each transaction to ensure the advertising it receives has economic substance and records revenue in an
amount equal to the fair value of the products and services received unless this is not reasonable to estimate, in which case the consideration
is measured based on the standalone selling price of the advertising inventory promised or delivered to the customer. Trade and barter
revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is fulfilled and follows the same pattern of recognition as the Company’s
normal advertising revenue. Trade and barter expense is recorded when goods or services are consumed. The trade and barter expense is
recorded in sales and marketing expenses in the unaudited condensed consolidated interim statements of operations.

Arrangement
to Sell Shares to Tether (Unit of Account)

The
Company applied judgment in determining whether the support agreements and agreement to sell shares to Tether were a single unit or multiple
units of account. Given that the agreements were entered into contemporaneously and in contemplation of one another, the closing of the
support agreements was contingent on the close of the sale of shares to Tether, and the agreements relate to the same underlying risk
(the price risk of the Company’s shares), the Company determined that the overall arrangement was one unit of account. As a result,
the arrangement is accounted for as a derivative, initially and subsequently measured at fair value with changes through net loss. See
Note 15 for information regarding the estimation of the fair value of the derivative.

New
Accounting Pronouncements

See
Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our Annual Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2024 and
2023.

JOBS
Act Accounting Election

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised
accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We intend to elect to adopt new or revised accounting
standards under private company adoption timelines. Accordingly, the timing of our adoption of new or revised accounting standards will
not be the same as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies or that have opted out of using such extended transition
period and our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or
revised accounting standards.

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We
are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations.

Credit
and Concentration Risk

We
are exposed to credit risk on our cash, cash equivalents, and accounts receivable. We place cash and cash equivalents with financial
institutions with high credit standing, and we place excess cash in money market funds, treasury bills, and term deposits. We are exposed
to credit risk on our accounts receivable in the event of default by a customer. We bill our customers under customary payment terms
and review customers for their creditworthiness. The term between invoicing and payment due date is not significant. For the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2025, no single customer represented 10% or more of the Company’s total revenue. For the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2024, one customer accounted for $3,192,053 and $11,671,470 or 13% and 18% of
revenue, respectively. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, no single customer represented 10% or more of the total accounts
receivable.

Interest
Rate Risk

We
are exposed to interest rate risk on our cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents of $269.8 million,
consisting of investments in money market funds, treasury bills, and term deposits for which the fair market value would be affected
by changes in the general level of interest rates. However, due to the short-term maturities and the low-risk profile of our investments,
an immediate 10% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities.

43

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our
management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have reviewed and evaluated the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based
on this review and evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated
and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes
in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

As
previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2024, corresponding to the control activities component of internal control under the COSO Framework. Specifically,
we did not adequately design certain key controls at a sufficient level of precision, including account reconciliation, to address relevant
financial reporting risks including inadequate design of procedures to ensure completeness and accuracy of the accounting for content
creator agreements, and associated assets, liabilities and expenses. See Item 9A “Controls and Procedures” of the Annual
Report on Form 10-K for further information. We and our Board of Directors are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment.
Management, with the oversight of the audit committee of our Board of Directors have evaluated the material weaknesses and have implemented
a remediation plan to address the material weaknesses and enhance our control environment. To date, we have taken and are continuing
to take steps to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting through the continued hiring of additional appropriately skilled
finance and accounting personnel with the requisite technical knowledge and skills. With the additional skilled personnel, we are taking
appropriate and reasonable steps to remediate these material weaknesses through formalization of accounting policies and controls around
content creator agreements, and retention of external accounting advisors for complex accounting transactions. We will not be able to
fully remediate material weaknesses until these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period
of time.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

We
are, and from time to time may become, involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business activities,
such as copyright infringement and tort claims arising from user-uploaded content, patent infringement claims, breach of contract claims,
government demands, putative class actions based upon consumer protection or privacy laws and other matters. The amounts that may be
recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance coverage.

In
January 2021, we filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging
that Google unlawfully gives an advantage to its YouTube platform over Rumble in search engine results and in the mobile phone market.
The court heard argument on Google’s motion for summary judgment in February 2025. The trial was scheduled for July 7, 2025. On
May 21, 2025, the court granted Google’s motion for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds and dismissed the case.
The Company has filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Company’s appeal brief was filed
on September 10, 2025. Google’s opposition brief [is due November 10, 2025] and the Company’s reply is due December 1, 2025.

In
addition, in May 2024, we filed a second antitrust lawsuit against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California
related to Google’s monopolization of the online advertising market. This lawsuit is separate and distinct from the self-preferencing
lawsuit filed in January 2021. In August 2024, we filed an amended complaint, and in September 2024, Google filed a motion to dismiss.
In December 2024, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) transferred the case to the existing proceeding, In re:
Google Digital Advertising Antitrust Litigation (JPML No. 3010). After common questions of fact are resolved in the Multidistrict Litigation
proceeding, this case would be transferred back to the Northern District of California for trial. A second amended complaint was filed
in April 2025. Google sought leave to file a motion to dismiss, which motion was filed on August 1, 2025. The Company’s response
to such motion to dismiss was filed on October 3, 2025.

In
January 2022, we received notification of a lawsuit filed by Kosmayer Investment Inc. (“KII”) against Rumble and Mr. Pavlovski
in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, alleging fraudulent misrepresentation in connection with KII’s decision to redeem its
shares of Rumble in August 2020. KII is seeking rescission of such redemption such that, following such rescission, KII would own 20%
of the issued and outstanding shares of Rumble or, in the alternative, damages for the lost value of the redeemed shares, which KII has
alleged to be worth $419.0 million (based on the value ascribed to the shares of Rumble in the Business Combination), together with other
damages including punitive damages and costs. Although we believe that the allegations are meritless and intend to vigorously defend
against them, the result or impact of such claims is uncertain, and could result in, among other things, damages, and/or awards of attorneys’
fees or expenses. A mediation session was held in April 2025. No settlement was reached. The case remains in discovery.

Along
with co-plaintiff Eugene Volokh, in December 2022, we filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
to block the enforcement of New York State’s Social Media Law. In February 2023, the court granted our motion for a preliminary
injunction, halting enforcement of the law. The New York Attorney General appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit. In a 2-1 decision, the court held that if the law were interpreted our way, it would be unconstitutional; that said,
they believe a different interpretation of the law is possible and have certified the questions to state high court to interpret the
law, putting off federal appellate ruling on constitutionality. The injunction remains in place while the state court reviews.

In
August 2024, we filed an antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas against the World Federation
of Advertisers, WPP plc, and GroupM Worldwide LLC alleging a conspiracy to withhold advertising revenue from Rumble and other digital
media platforms. The lawsuit seeks a declaration that the defendants’ conduct is illegal, a permanent injunction against the conduct,
damages, interest, and legal fees, among other relief. In September 2024, we filed an amended complaint, which added Diageo plc as a
defendant. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on February 21, 2025. Our answer was filed on April 15, 2025, and the defendants’
response was filed on June 17, 2025. GroupM subsequently filed a motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York. On August 13, 2025, the court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss on the grounds of lack of personal
jurisdiction.

45

In
October 2024, plaintiff David Stebbins filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware naming Rumble and an unaffiliated
entity doing business as “The Specter Report” as defendants. Mr. Stebbins, who is not represented by counsel, alleges six
counts of copyright infringement and one count of slander and seeks injunctive relief and $900,000 in damages from Rumble. We have not
yet been formally served with the lawsuit and believe that the allegations are meritless. The court dismissed the case against the Company
in May 2025. The plaintiff appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.

In
November 2024, we filed a lawsuit against the California Attorney General and Secretary of State in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern
District of California to enjoin the enforcement of AB 2655, a recently enacted state law regulating online platforms. The law would
require online platforms to receive reports about posts related to elections, public officials, and candidates for office that are deemed
“materially deceptive,” then remove or label the content. Our lawsuit was consolidated with similar lawsuits filed by other
affected online platforms and content creators, and the state of California has agreed to enjoin the enforcement of the law during the
initial phases of the litigation. The plaintiffs’ summary judgment motions were filed on March 7, 2025. A further stay of enforcement
was issued by the court through October 25, 2025. The summary judgment hearing took place on August 5, 2025. The judge granted our summary
judgment motion from the bench. He ruled that Section 230 preempted all of AB 2655 and subsequently issued a permanent injunction against
the enforcement of AB 2655. The state of California has appealed.

In
February 2025, we filed a complaint and a request for a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”) in the U.S. District Court for
the Middle District of Florida against Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes related to content blocking orders issued
by him against Rumble. The court denied, without prejudice, Rumble’s motion for a TRO on the grounds that the matter was not ripe
for judicial review. The court noted that Justice Moraes’s pronouncements and directives had not been properly served on Rumble,
that Rumble was not obligated to comply with such pronouncements and directives, and that no U.S. entity was required to enforce them.
We filed an amended complaint on June 6, 2025. We filed a request to supplement the amended complaint on July 13, 2025 in response to
a new illegal blocking order from Justice Moraes and filed a further amended complaint on July 16, 2025, which is being served via the
Hague Service Convention..

In
April 2025, along with Rebel News, we filed a lawsuit in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice against Canada, Canada Lands Company,
Ya’ara Saks, et al alleging that the defendants tried to block two lawful and peaceful public gatherings celebrating free speech
in the Toronto area in 2024 because they disagreed with the political points of view of the organizers (Rebel News) and participants.
We alleged that the officials tried to thwart the events by imposing unreasonably high charges for security measures that were not needed
and designed only to prevent the events from taking place. Various motions have been filed by the defendants in an effort to remove certain
parties from the action. A notice of discontinuance (without prejudice) was filed by Rebel News and the Company in respect of His Majesty
the King in Right of Canada and The Attorney General of Canada.

In
June 2025, we were served with a lawsuit from an individual named Michael Goldstein, alleging that the Company violated the California
Invasion of Privacy Act by improperly disclosing personally identifiable information by way of the Facebook Pixel. The case was brought
in California state court. The case was moved to federal court in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The
Company filed a motion to dismiss on August 18, 2025. The plaintiff responded on September 18, 2025, to which the Company replied on
October 9, 2025. As with prior privacy-related lawsuits, we believe that the plaintiff’s allegations are meritless.

46

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Except
as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors described under the caption “Risk Factors” in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. You should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and cautionary
statements described therein, together with the other disclosures in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our other public filings
with the SEC. Any such risks and uncertainties, as well as risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem
to be immaterial, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.

Risks
Related to Our Business

Prolonged
or escalating trade disputes could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our
business, operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected by ongoing trade disputes, including tariffs, trade restrictions,
and other protectionist measures imposed by governments globally. While we do not directly engage in the importation or exportation of
goods, we operate within a complex global ecosystem that is highly sensitive to disruptions caused by trade conflicts. These disputes
could lead to increased costs, supply chain disruptions, and reduced demand for our products and services, even though our operations
are primarily service-based. Trade disputes may result in higher costs for hardware, components, or software services provided by our
suppliers, who may face tariffs or other trade barriers and are likely to pass these costs on to us. Additionally, trade disputes may
disrupt the global supply chains on which our partners or customers rely, potentially reducing advertising spend and delaying the development,
deployment, or adoption of our cloud technology solutions. Trade disputes may also contribute to broader economic uncertainty, including
inflationary pressures, currency fluctuations, or reduced global investment in advertising and technology, leading to decreased demand
for our advertising and cloud offerings, as customers seek to reduce costs. Geopolitical tensions arising from trade conflicts could
also result in regulatory changes, such as export controls or data localization requirements, which may increase our compliance costs
or restrict our ability to operate in certain markets.

The
unpredictable nature, duration, and severity of trade disputes make it difficult to mitigate their impact fully. Prolonged or escalating
trade disputes could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The
operation of our crypto wallet exposes us to significant regulatory, operational, security, and market risks that could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.

The
operation of the Rumble Wallet, our recently launched non-custodial crypto wallet, which enables users to hold multiple cryptocurrencies,
engage in tipping on our video platform, and utilize on- and off-ramps through partnership with a third-party crypto exchange, exposes
us to significant regulatory, operational, security, and market risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition,
results of operations, and reputation.

The
cryptocurrency industry is subject to extensive and evolving regulatory scrutiny in the United States and internationally, including
from federal agencies and state financial regulators. Our crypto wallet and associated features, even though non-custodial in nature
(meaning we do not hold or control users’ private keys or assets), may be deemed to involve money transmission, securities activities,
or other regulated financial services, particularly in connection with tipping functionality and integrations with third-party exchanges
for fiat-to-crypto conversions. Changes in laws, regulations, or interpretations, such as classifications of certain cryptocurrencies
as securities, enhanced know-your-customer (KYC) or anti-money laundering (AML) requirements, or restrictions on non-custodial wallets,
could require us to obtain licenses, modify our offerings, or cease operations in certain jurisdictions. Non-compliance, whether actual
or alleged, could result in investigations, enforcement actions, fines, penalties, or litigation, which may be costly and time-consuming
to defend. For example, if regulators view our tipping feature as facilitating unregistered securities transactions or unlicensed money
services, we could face significant liabilities.

47

Our
reliance on a partnership with an existing crypto exchange for on- and off-ramp services introduces dependency risks. The exchange may
experience operational disruptions, security breaches, regulatory issues, or insolvency, which could interrupt our users’ ability
to deposit or withdraw funds, leading to user dissatisfaction, loss of trust, and potential claims against us. We have limited control
over the exchange’s compliance, performance, or risk management practices, and any failures on the exchange’s part could
be attributed to us by users or regulators, harming our brand and exposing us to liability.

Security
vulnerabilities remain a critical concern, despite the non-custodial design. Our video platform’s integration with the wallet could
be targeted by cyberattacks, phishing schemes, or exploits aimed at users’ devices or our software interfaces, potentially resulting
in unauthorized access, theft of user assets, or data breaches. User errors, such as loss of private keys or exposure to scams, could
also lead to financial losses for which users might seek to hold us responsible through lawsuits or negative publicity.

Competition
in the crypto wallet space is significant, with established players offering similar non-custodial solutions. If our wallet fails to
achieve sufficient user adoption due to usability issues, lack of supported cryptocurrencies, or superior alternatives, we may incur
substantial development and marketing costs without corresponding benefits. Moreover, broader market events, such as crypto market crashes,
exchange failures (such as the FTX bankruptcy), or increased regulatory crackdowns, could reduce overall interest in cryptocurrencies,
diminishing the value of our wallet features and potentially leading to impairment of related investments or assets. Any of these risks
could result in increased operating expenses, loss of users, damage to our reputation, or material adverse effects on our financial performance.

Risks
Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment in Which We Operate 

Transition
to Large Accelerated Filer status will require additional resources and expose us to additional risks.

As
a result of our public float exceeding the threshold established by the SEC, we will become a large accelerated filer as of December
31, 2025. This transition will subject us to more stringent reporting and compliance obligations, including shorter deadlines for filing
periodic reports, such as our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and increased scrutiny of our internal controls
over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Compliance with these heightened requirements will require significant
additional resources, including increased management time and attention, as well as higher legal, accounting, and other professional
fees. The transition to large accelerated filer status may strain our financial and operational resources, particularly if we are unable
to scale our systems, processes, and internal controls effectively to meet these obligations. Any failure to comply with these requirements
in a timely or accurate manner could result in regulatory penalties, reputational harm, or a loss of investor confidence, which could
adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise capital in the future. Additionally, the increased demands of compliance may
divert management’s focus from other strategic and operational priorities, potentially impacting our business performance.

We
are exposed to significant regulatory, operational, compliance, privacy, and legal risks related to age verification and child online
safety laws implemented in various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions.

The
implementation and enforcement of age verification and child online safety laws in various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions present
significant regulatory, operational, compliance, privacy, and legal risks to our business as a video services provider, which could adversely
affect our MAUs, revenue, reputation, and financial condition. Numerous laws, regulations, and legally-binding codes, such as the Children’s
Online Privacy Protection Act, California’s Age Appropriate Design Code, the CCPA, other U.S. state comprehensive privacy laws,
the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation, the EU’s Digital Services Act, the UK’s Online Safety Act and the UK Age
Appropriate Design Code, impose various obligations on companies that process minors’ data and/or provide online services, or other
interactive platforms used by children, including prohibiting showing minors advertising, requiring age verification, limiting the use
of minors’ personal information, requiring certain consents to process such data and extending certain rights to children and their
parents with respect to that data. These new laws may result in restrictions on the use of certain of our products or services by teens,
may prohibit us from offering certain of our products or services to teens, and may decrease daily active users or user engagement in
various jurisdictions. These laws may be, and in some cases already have been, subject to legal challenges and changing interpretations
which may further complicate our efforts to comply with laws applicable to us. Some of these obligations have wide ranging applications,
including for services that do not intentionally target child users (defined in some circumstances as a user under the age of 18 years
old). The resulting patchwork of regulations is rapidly evolving, with potential for additional jurisdictions to adopt similar measures,
creating inconsistent and overlapping obligations.

48

We
have already implemented a minimum age of 17 for registered users on our video platform and require users to provide their date of birth,
further to that requirement. However, compliance with these new laws may require us to implement additional measures and complex age
verification technologies, such as biometric checks, third-party ID verification, or parental consent mechanisms, which could involve
substantial development, integration, and ongoing maintenance costs, decrease our advertising and subscription revenue, and increase
legal risk and compliance costs for us and our third-party partners, any of which could seriously harm our business. These systems may
generally deter users from using our platform and create risks of inaccurate age determinations, user circumvention, or over-blocking
of legitimate adult users, potentially resulting in reduced user acquisition, engagement, and retention, particularly among younger demographics
that represent a significant portion of our growth. Non-compliance, whether due to technical failures, differing jurisdictional interpretations,
or delays in implementation, could lead to investigations, enforcement actions, substantial fines, class-action lawsuits, or injunctions
restricting our operations in affected regions. If we challenge these laws, as a defendant or through industry-wide challenges, we could
be negatively impacted by protracted legal battles, adverse rulings, or requirements to fundamentally alter our platform’s features,
content moderation, or user experience. Additionally, varying international standards may force us to create region-specific versions
of our platform, increasing operational complexity and costs while potentially fragmenting our global user community.

Broader
market reactions, such as user backlash against perceived privacy intrusions or reduced platform accessibility, could erode trust in
our brand and lead to competitive disadvantages if rivals adapt more effectively. We may incur significant expenses for legal counsel,
technology upgrades, and compliance programs, and there is no assurance that these measures will fully mitigate the risks. The materialization
of any of these factors could have a substantial negative impact on our business and results of operations.

Risks Related to Business Combinations

On November 10, 2025, we signed
a business combination agreement with Northern Data. Refer to Note 19, Subsequent Events, to our condensed consolidated interim financial
statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for more details. The following are a number of risks we face in connection with
this proposed business combination.

The occurrence of any event, change or other
circumstances that could give rise to the termination of our business combination agreement with Northern Data could adversely affect
our future business.

There are significant risks
and uncertainties associated with our proposed business combination with Northern Data. The occurrence of certain events, changes or any
other circumstances could give rise to the termination of the business combination agreement and cause the business combination not to
be completed. Failure to complete the proposed business combination with Northern Data would prevent us from realizing its anticipated
benefits to our business.

Our business could be adversely impacted
by uncertainty related to the proposed business combination with Northern Data, whether or not the business combination is completed.

Whether or not the proposed
business combination with Northern Data is completed, the announcement and pendency of the business combination could impact our business,
which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and the success of the business combination, including:

●
that the proposed business combination disrupts our current
business plans and operations;

●
our management’s attention being directed toward the completion
of the business combination and transaction-related considerations and being diverted away from our day-to-day business operations and
the execution of our current business plans; and

●
incurring transaction costs, such as legal, financing and accounting
fees, and other costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the business combination, whether or not the business combination is completed.

The anticipated benefits of the proposed
business combination with Northern Data may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.

There can be no assurance
that we will realize the full benefits that we currently expect from the proposed business combination with Northern Data or that these
benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs,
decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy and could materially adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations.
