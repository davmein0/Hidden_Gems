1A. Risk Factors

Risks
and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements
contained in this Form 10-K and other public statements we make are described below. Investors in our securities should carefully consider
these risk factors, in addition to the risks and uncertainties discussed above under “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements,” together with all of the other information included in this Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC. The occurrence
of one or more of the events or circumstances described in these risk factors, alone or in combination with other events or circumstances,
may have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. We may face additional risks and
uncertainties that are not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, which may also impair our business, cash flows,
financial condition and results of operations. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated
financial statements, which are included in Part II of this Form 10-K.

Summary
of Risk Factors

The
following summarizes risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of
operations. You should read this summary together with the detailed description of each risk factor contained in this section. Such risks
and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:

●
weakened
                                            global economic conditions, including the effects of heightened inflation, may affect our
                                            business and operating results;

●
our
                                            limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects;

●
we
                                            may not continue to grow or maintain our active user base, and may not be able to achieve
                                            or maintain profitability;

●
we
                                            may fail to maintain adequate operational and financial resources;

●
we
                                            may be unsuccessful in attracting new users to our mobile and connected TV offerings;

●
our
                                            traffic growth, engagement, and monetization depend upon effective operation within and compatibility
                                            with operating systems, networks, devices, web browsers and standards, including mobile operating
                                            systems, networks, and standards that we do not control;

●
our
                                            business depends on continued and unimpeded access to our content and services on the internet.
                                            If we or those who engage with our content experience disruptions in internet service, or
                                            if internet service providers are able to block, degrade or charge for access to our content
                                            and services, we could incur additional expenses and the loss of traffic and advertisers;

●
we
                                            face significant market competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively with our
                                            competitors for traffic and advertising spend, our business and operating results could be
                                            harmed;

●
we
                                            rely on data from third parties to calculate certain of our performance metrics. Real or
                                            perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our
                                            business;

●
changes
                                            to our existing content and services could fail to attract traffic and advertisers or fail
                                            to generate revenue;

7

●
we
                                            derive the majority of our revenue from advertising. The failure to attract new advertisers,
                                            the loss of existing advertisers, or the reduction of or failure by existing advertisers
                                            to maintain or increase their advertising budgets may adversely affect our business and operating
                                            results;

●
we
                                            may not be able to maintain relationships with existing publishers through the Rumble Advertising
                                            Center (RAC) and may fail to attract new publishers to our network;

●
we
                                            depend on third-party vendors, including internet service providers, advertising networks,
                                            and data centers, to provide core services;

●
new
                                            technologies have been developed that are able to block certain online advertisements or
                                            impair our ability to deliver advertising, which could harm our operating results;

●
if
                                            our users do not continue to contribute content or their contributions are not perceived
                                            as valuable to other users, we may experience a decline in user growth, retention, and engagement
                                            on Rumble, Locals or RAC, which could result in the loss of advertisers and revenue;

●
we
                                            have offered and intend to continue to offer incentives, including economic incentives, to
                                            content creators to join our platform, and these arrangements may involve fixed payment obligations
                                            that are not contingent on actual revenue or performance metrics generated by the applicable
                                            content creator but rather are based on our modeled financial projections for that creator,
                                            which if not satisfied may adversely impact our financial performance, results of operations
                                            and liquidity;

●
we
                                            are subject to cybersecurity risks and interruptions or failures in our information technology
                                            systems and as we grow and gain recognition, we will likely need to expend additional resources
                                            to enhance our protection from such risks. Notwithstanding our efforts, a cyber incident
                                            could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or
                                            financial loss;

●
spam
                                            activity, including inauthentic and fraudulent user activity, if undetected, may contribute,
                                            from time to time, to some amount of overstatement of our performance indicators and may
                                            negatively impact our reputation;

●
our
                                            cloud services business may not achieve success, and, as a result, our business, financial
                                            condition and results of operations could be adversely affected;

●
negative
                                            media campaigns may adversely impact our financial performance, results of operations, and
                                            relationships with our business partners, including content creators and advertisers;

●
our
                                            management team has limited experience managing a public company;

●
our
                                            recently implemented Bitcoin treasury strategy exposes us to various risks associated with
                                            holding Bitcoin;

●
our
                                            planned expansion into accepting certain stablecoins as a medium of exchange will expose
                                            us to additional financial, regulatory, operational, and market risks that could adversely
                                            affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;

●
the
                                            development and use of artificial intelligence (“AI”) may result in reputational
                                            harm, liability, or other adverse consequences to our business operations;

●

                                            of our users and subscribers. If our security measures are breached, our sites and applications
                                            may be perceived as not being secure, traffic and advertisers may curtail or stop viewing
                                            our content or using our services, our business and operating results could be harmed, and
                                            we could face legal claims from users and subscribers;

●
we
                                            may fail to comply with applicable privacy laws, subjecting us to liability and damages;

●
our
                                            cloud services business operates in a highly regulated environment, subject to a complex
                                            and rapidly evolving array of domestic and international laws, regulations, and industry
                                            standards governing data privacy, cybersecurity, data localization, and cross-border data
                                            transfers;

noncompliance
                                            with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, and similar laws can subject us
                                            to criminal or civil liability and harm our business, financial condition and results of
                                            operations;

●
we
                                            may be found to have infringed on the intellectual property of others, which could expose
                                            us to substantial losses or restrict our operations;

●
we
                                            may face liability for hosting a variety of tortious or unlawful materials uploaded by third
                                            parties, notwithstanding the liability protections of Section 230;

●
the
                                            incentives that we offer to certain content creators may lead to liability based on the actions
                                            of those creators;

●
changes
                                            in tax rates, changes in tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce, the adoption of
                                            new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities may
                                            adversely impact our financial results;

                                            industry practices may adversely affect our business and operating results;

●
we
                                            may become subject to newly enacted laws and regulations that restrict content on the internet;

●
paid
                                            endorsements by our content creators may expose us to regulatory risk, liability, and compliance
                                            costs, and, as a result, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
                                            of operations;

●
we
                                            may face negative publicity for removing, or declining to remove, certain content, regardless
                                            of whether such content violated any law;

●
our
                                            Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) has control over key decision making as a result
                                            of his control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock;

●
our
                                            CEO may be incentivized to focus on the short-term share price as a result of his interest
                                            in shares placed in escrow and subject to forfeiture pursuant to the terms of the Business
                                            Combination Agreement;

                                            a public company, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition

●
substantial
                                            future sales of our Class A Common Stock by our current stockholders could cause the market

Risks
Relating to Our Business

Weakened
global economic conditions, including the effects of heightened inflation, may affect our business and operating results.

Our
overall performance depends in part on worldwide economic conditions. Global financial developments and downturns seemingly unrelated
to us or our industry may negatively affect us. The U.S. and other key international economies have been affected from time to time by
falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, reduced liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, weak economic
growth, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies, implemented or threatened tariffs, trade wars, inflation
and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. Weak economic conditions or the perception thereof, or significant uncertainty regarding
the stability of financial markets related to stock market volatility, inflation, recession, changes in governmental fiscal, monetary
and tax policies, among others, could adversely impact our business and operating results.

High
inflation rates in the U.S. and globally may result in reduced consumer confidence and discretionary spending, decreased demand by advertisers
for our products and services, increases in our labor and other operating costs, constrained credit and liquidity, reduced government
spending and volatility in financial markets. The Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve has raised, may again raise, or
may delay lowering the target federal funds rate in response to concerns over inflation risk. Higher than typical interest rates impact
the cost of any borrowing that we may make from time to time and could impact our ability to access the capital markets. Higher than
typical interest rates, especially if coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets, may have the effect
of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks. In an inflationary environment, we may be unable to increase
our revenues at or above the rate at which our costs increase, which could negatively impact our operating margins and could have a material
adverse effect on our business and operating results. In such an environment, in which we also face significant competition from larger
and well-capitalized competitors, we may experience rising costs to secure the services of top content creators. We also may experience
lower-than-expected advertising sales, reduced demand for our cloud services offerings, and potential adverse impacts on our competitive
position if there is a decrease in consumer spending.

Our
limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.

We
have a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our businesses and prospects or forecast our future results. We
are subject to the same risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets. Our financial results
in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors, many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control, including:

●
our
                                            ability to maintain and grow traffic, content uploads, and engagement;

●
changes
                                            made to other online video sharing platforms, short form video platforms, video streaming
                                            services, or changes in the patterns of use of those channels by users;

●
our
                                            ability to attract and retain advertisers and content creators in a particular period;

●
the
                                            number of ads shown to our traffic;

●
the
                                            pricing of our advertising products;

●
the
                                            diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond current advertising products;

●
the
                                            development and introduction of new content, products, or services by us or our competitors;

●
increases
                                            in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and expand our
                                            operations and to remain competitive;

●
our
                                            reliance on key vendor relationships, including our relationship with Cosmic Inc. and Kosmik
                                            Development Skopje doo (“Cosmic”) to provide content moderation, cybersecurity
                                            support, and software development services, and dependence on a small number of customer
                                            relationships; 	

●
legislation
                                            or judicial activity in Canada, the European Union, or other jurisdictions that forces us
                                            to change our content moderation policies and practices, deactivate certain user accounts,
                                            or make our platforms unavailable in those jurisdictions;	

●

We
may not continue to grow or maintain our active user base, may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability, and may not be able
to scale our systems, technology, or infrastructure effectively or grow our business at the same or similar rate as other comparable
companies.

The
growth of our user base, as measured by our current key performance metrics, including monthly active users (MAUs), may not be sustainable
and should not be considered indicative of future levels of active viewers and future performance. In addition, we may not realize sufficient
revenue to achieve or, if achieved, maintain profitability. As we grow our business, our revenue growth rates may slow or reverse in
future periods due to several reasons, which may include slowing demand for our services, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth
of our overall market, an inability to scale our systems, technology or infrastructure effectively, and the failure to capitalize on
growth opportunities or the maturation of our business. We may incur losses in the future for several reasons, including insufficient
growth in the level of engagement, a failure to retain our existing level of engagement, increasing competition, the failure to continue
to attract content creators with large followings, the payment of fixed payment obligations to content creators who join our platform
that turn out to be unprofitable over the term of the applicable contract as a result of actual performance that does not meet our original
modeled financial projections for that creator, the unavailability of certain popular content creators for extended periods of time due
to personal or other reasons, as well as other risks described in these “Risk Factors,” and we may encounter unforeseen expenses,
difficulties, complications and delays and other unknown factors. We expect to continue to make investments in the development and expansion
of our business, which may not result in increased or sufficient revenue or growth, including relative to other comparable companies,
as a result of which we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability.

10

If
we fail to maintain adequate operational and financial resources, particularly if we continue to grow rapidly, we may be unable to execute
our business plan or maintain high levels of service and customer satisfaction.

We
have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, rapid growth, which has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands
on our management and our operational and financial resources. Our organizational structure is becoming more complex as we scale our
operational, financial, and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures, and expand internationally. As we continue
to grow, we face challenges of integrating, developing, training, and motivating a rapidly growing employee base in our various offices
in multiple jurisdictions and navigating a complex multinational regulatory landscape. If we fail to manage our anticipated growth and
change in a manner that preserves the functionality of our platforms and solutions, the quality of our products and services may suffer,
which could negatively affect our brand and reputation and harm our ability to attract customers.

To
manage growth in our operations and personnel, we will need to continue to grow and improve our operational, financial, and management
controls and our reporting systems and procedures. We will require significant capital expenditures and the allocation of valuable management
resources to grow and change in these areas. Our expansion has placed, and our expected future growth will continue to place, a significant
strain on our management, customer experience, research and development, sales and marketing, administrative, financial, and other resources.

We
anticipate that significant additional investments will be required to scale our operations and increase productivity, to address the
needs of our customers, to further develop and enhance our products and services, including our cloud services business, to expand into
new geographic areas and to scale with our overall growth. If additional investments are required due to significant growth, this will
increase our cost base, which will make it more difficult for us to offset any future revenue shortfalls by reducing expenses in the
short term.

Users
are increasingly using mobile devices and connected TV apps to access content within digital media and adjacent businesses, and if we
are unsuccessful in attracting new users to our mobile and connected TV offerings and expanding the capabilities of our content and other
offerings with respect to our mobile and connected TV platforms, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.

Our
future success depends in part on the continued growth in the use of our mobile apps and platforms by our users. The use of mobile technology
may not continue to grow at historical rates, users may not continue to use mobile technology to access digital media and adjacent businesses,
and monetization rates for content on mobile devices and connected TV apps may be lower than monetization rates on traditional desktop
platforms. Further, mobile devices may not be accepted as a viable long-term platform for several reasons, including actual or perceived
lack of security of information and possible disruptions of service or connectivity. In addition, traffic on our mobile platforms may
not continue to grow if we do not continue to innovate and introduce enhanced products on such platforms, or if users believe that our
competitors offer superior mobile products. The growth of traffic on our mobile products may also slow or decline if our mobile applications
are no longer compatible with operating systems such as iOS, Android, Windows or the devices they support. If use of our mobile platforms
does not continue to grow, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.

Our
traffic growth, engagement, and monetization depend upon effective operation within and compatibility with operating systems, networks,
devices, web browsers and standards, including mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control.

We
make our content available across a variety of operating systems and through websites. We are dependent on the compatibility of our content
with popular devices, streaming tools, desktop and mobile operating systems, connected TV systems, web browsers that we do not control,
such as Mac OS, Windows, Android, iOS, Chrome and Firefox, and mobile application stores, such as Apple’s App Store and the Google
Play Store. Any changes in such systems, devices or web browsers that degrade the functionality of our content or give preferential treatment
to competitive content could adversely affect usage of our content.

11

A
significant portion of our traffic accesses our content and services through mobile devices and, as a result, our ability to grow traffic,
engagement and advertising revenue is increasingly dependent on our ability to generate revenue from content viewed and engaged with
on mobile devices. A key element of our strategy is focusing on mobile apps and connected TV apps, and we expect to continue to devote
significant resources to the creation and support of developing new and innovative mobile and connected TV products, services and apps.
We are dependent on the interoperability of our content and our apps with popular mobile operating systems, streaming tools, networks
and standards that we do not control, such as the Android and iOS operating systems. We also depend on the availability of the Rumble
app on mobile app stores, such as Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store, and if our access to such stores is limited or terminated,
regardless of the legitimacy of the stated reasons, our ability to reach users through our mobile app will be negatively impacted. We
may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile and connected TV industries or in
developing content that operates effectively with these technologies, systems, tools, networks, or standards. Any changes in such systems,
or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset and connected TV manufacturers, or mobile carriers, or
in their terms of service or policies that reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute and monetize our content, impair access to our
content by blocking access through mobile devices, make it hard to readily discover, install, update or access our content and apps on
mobile devices and connected TVs, limit the effectiveness of advertisements, give preferential treatment to competitive, or their own,
content or apps, limit our ability to measure the effectiveness of branded content, or charge fees related to the distribution of our
content or apps could adversely affect the consumption and monetization of our content on mobile devices. Additionally, our operating
expenses will increase if the number of platforms for which we develop our product expands. In the event that it is more difficult to
access our content or use our apps and services, particularly on mobile devices and connected TVs, or if our users choose not to access
our content or use our apps on their mobile devices and connected TVs or choose to use mobile products or connected TVs that do not offer
access to our content or our apps, or if the preferences of our traffic require us to increase the number of platforms on which our product
is made available to our traffic, our traffic growth, engagement, ad targeting and monetization could be harmed and our business and
operating results could be adversely affected.

Our
business depends on continued and unimpeded access to our content and services on the internet. If we or those who engage with our content
experience disruptions in internet service, or if internet service providers are able to block, degrade or charge for access to our content
and services, we could incur additional expenses and the loss of traffic and advertisers.

Our
products and services depend on the ability of users to access our content and services on the internet. Currently, this access is provided
by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies,
cable companies, mobile communications companies and government-owned service providers. Laws or regulations that adversely affect the
growth, popularity or use of the internet, including changes to laws or regulations impacting internet neutrality, could decrease the
demand for our products or offerings, increase our operating costs, require us to alter the manner in which we conduct our business and/or
otherwise adversely affect our business. We could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede our growth,
cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business. For example, paid prioritization could enable internet
service providers, or ISPs, to impose higher fees and otherwise adversely impact our business. Internationally, government regulation
concerning the internet, and in particular, network neutrality, may be developing or may not exist at all. Within such an environment,
without network neutrality regulations, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede both our and
our customers’ domestic and international growth, increase our costs or adversely affect our business.

We
rely on data from third parties to calculate certain of our performance metrics. Real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm
our reputation and negatively affect our business.

We
track certain performance metrics, such as our MAUs, based on data from third parties. While these numbers are based on what we believe
to be reasonable calculations for the applicable periods of measurement, our third-party providers periodically encounter difficulties
in providing accurate data for such metrics as a result of a variety of factors, including human and software errors. We expect these
challenges may continue to occur, and potentially to increase as our engagement grows. There are also inherent challenges in measuring
usage across our large user base. For example, as further described in our “Key Business Metrics” section, there is a potential
for minor overlap in our usage data due to users who access Rumble’s content through the web, our mobile apps, and connected TVs
in a given measurement period.

Third
parties on which we rely for certain of our key metrics may make changes or improvements to their tools and methodologies. For example,
starting July 1, 2023, Universal Analytics (UA), Google’s analytics platform on which we historically relied for calculating MAUs
using company-set parameters, was phased out by Google and ceased processing data. At that time, Google Analytics 4 (GA4) succeeded UA
as Google’s next-generation analytics platform, which we used to determine MAUs since the third quarter of 2023 and which we expect
to continue to use to determine MAUs in future periods. Although Google has disclosed certain information regarding the transition to
GA4, Google does not currently make available sufficient information relating to its new GA4 algorithm for us to determine the full effect
of the switch from UA to GA4 on our reported MAUs. Because Google has publicly stated that metrics in UA may be more or less similar
to metrics in GA4, and that it is not unusual for there to be apparent discrepancies between the two systems, we are unable to determine
whether the transition from UA to GA4 has had a positive or negative effect, or the magnitude of such effect, if any, on our reported
MAUs. It is therefore possible that MAUs that we reported based on the UA methodology for periods prior to July 1, 2023, cannot be meaningfully
compared to MAUs based on the GA4 methodology in subsequent periods.

12

Changes
to these tools and methodologies could cause inconsistency between current data and previously reported data, which could raise questions
about the usefulness of our reported metrics or make it more difficult for investors to accurately assess our performance over time.
If our users, advertisers, partners and stockholders do not perceive our metrics to be accurate representations, or if we discover material
inaccuracies in our metrics, our reputation may be damaged, resulting in material harm to our business, results of operations, and financial
condition.

We
face significant competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors for traffic and advertising spend, our
business and operating results could be harmed.

Competition
for traffic and engagement with our content, products and services is intense. We compete against companies that have greater financial
resources and larger user bases. As a result, our competitors may acquire and engage traffic and users at the expense of the growth or
engagement of our traffic and users, which would negatively affect our business. We believe that our ability to compete effectively for
traffic and users depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:

●
the
                                            popularity, usefulness and reliability of our content compared to that of our competitors;

●
the
                                            timing and market acceptance of our content;

●
the
                                            continued expansion and adoption of our content;

●
our
                                            ability, and the ability of our competitors, to develop new content and enhancements to existing
                                            content;

●
our
                                            ability, and the ability of our competitors, to attract, develop and retain influencers and
                                            creative talent;

●
the
                                            frequency, relative prominence and appeal of the advertising displayed by us or our competitors;

●
public
                                            perceptions about the predominance of certain political viewpoints on our platform, regardless
                                            of whether those perceptions are accurate;

●
changes
                                            mandated by, or that we elect to make to address, legislation, regulatory constraints or
                                            litigation, including settlements and consent decrees, some of which may have a disproportionate
                                            impact on us;

●
our
                                            ability to attract, retain and motivate talented employees;

●
the
                                            costs of developing and procuring new content, relative to those of our competitors;

●
acquisitions
                                            or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors; and

●
our
                                            reputation and brand strength relative to our competitors.

We
also face significant competition for advertiser spend. In determining whether to buy advertising, our advertisers will consider the
demand for our content, demographics of our traffic, advertising rates, results observed by advertisers, and alternative advertising
options. The increasing number of digital media options available, through social networking tools and news aggregation websites, has
expanded consumer choice significantly, resulting in traffic fragmentation and increased competition for advertising. In addition, some
of the larger companies have substantially broader content, product or service offerings and leverage their relationships based on other
products or services to gain additional share of advertising budgets. We will need to continue to innovate and improve the monetization
capabilities of our websites and our mobile products in order to remain competitive. We believe that our ability to compete effectively
for advertiser spend depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:

●
the
                                            size and composition of our user base relative to those of our competitors;

●
our
                                            ad targeting capabilities, and those of our competitors;

●
our
                                            ability, and the ability of our competitors, to adapt our respective models to the increasing
                                            power and significance of influencers to the advertising community;

●
the
                                            timing and market acceptance of our advertising content and advertising products, and those
                                            of our competitors;

●
our
                                            marketing and selling efforts, and those of our competitors;

●
public
                                            perceptions about the predominance of certain political viewpoints on our platform, regardless
                                            of whether those perceptions are accurate;

13

●
the
                                            pricing for our advertising products and services relative to those of our competitors;

●
the
                                            return our advertisers receive from our advertising products and services, and those of our
                                            competitors; and

●
our
                                            reputation and the strength of our brand relative to our competitors.

Our
cloud services business competes primarily with large, diversified technology companies that focus on large enterprise customers and
provide cloud computing as a component of the suite of services and products that they offer, as well as smaller, niche cloud service
providers. Many of our competitors and potential competitors, particularly the larger competitors, have substantial competitive advantages
compared to us, including greater name recognition and longer operating histories; greater resources, including larger sales and marketing
and customer support budgets; the ability to bundle products together; larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios; greater
resources to make acquisitions and greater resources for technical assistance and customer support. Competitors to our cloud services
business may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards, and
customer requirements. An existing competitor or a potential competitor could introduce new technology that reduces demand for our products
and platform capabilities. In addition, some of our actual and potential competitors have been acquired by other larger enterprises and
have made or may make acquisitions or may enter into partnerships or other strategic relationships that may provide more comprehensive
offerings than they individually had offered or achieve greater economies of scale than we are able to achieve.

Changes
to our existing content and services could fail to attract traffic and advertisers or fail to generate revenue.

We
may introduce significant changes to our existing content. The success of our new content depends substantially on consumer tastes and
preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. If this new content fails to engage traffic and advertisers, we may fail to generate
sufficient revenue or operating profit to justify our investments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.
In addition, we may launch (and incur expenses in connection with) strategic initiatives from time to time, which do not directly generate
revenue but which we believe will enhance our attractiveness to traffic and advertisers. In the future, we may invest in new content,
products, services, and initiatives to generate revenue, but there is no guarantee these approaches will be successful or that the costs
associated with these efforts will not exceed the revenue generated. If our strategic initiatives do not enhance our ability to monetize
our existing content or enable us to develop new approaches to monetization, we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue or recover
any associated development costs and our operating results could be adversely affected.

We
derive the majority of our revenue from advertising. The failure to attract new advertisers, the loss of existing advertisers, or the
reduction of or failure by existing advertisers to maintain or increase their advertising budgets may adversely affect our business and
operating results. 

For
the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, advertising revenue represents 66% and 74% of total revenue. In addition, a substantial portion
of our revenue is derived from one advertiser accounting for approximately 16% and 46% of our revenue for the years ended December 31,
2024 and 2023, respectively. As is common in our industry, our advertisers do not have long-term advertising commitments with us. In
addition, many of our advertisers purchase advertising services through one of several large advertising agency holding companies. Our
revenue could be harmed by the loss of, or a deterioration in our relationship with, any of our largest advertisers or with any advertising
agencies or the holding companies that control them. Advertising agencies and potential new advertisers may view our advertising products
and services as experimental and unproven, and we may need to devote additional time and resources to educate them about our products
and services. Advertisers may cease doing business with us, or they may reduce the prices they are willing to pay to advertise with us,
if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner, or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate
a competitive return relative to alternatives, including online, mobile, and traditional advertising platforms. Advertisers may refuse
to advertise on our platform due to a perceived risk to their brand safety standards, especially given the concentration of news and
political content on our platform. We believe that our access to certain advertisers has been, and may continue to be, inhibited by the
apparent political bias of these companies, some of which we believe may exercise near monopolistic control over the advertising industry.
In response, we filed an antitrust lawsuit alleging a conspiracy to withhold advertising revenue from Rumble and other digital media
platforms. Our actions to counter these efforts, whether through litigation or publicity campaigns, may not be successful. Any of the
foregoing developments may adversely affect our business and operating results.

14

We
may not be able to maintain relationships with existing publishers through RAC and may fail to attract new publishers to our network.

Through
our RAC marketplace, we provide advertising inventory, including host-read advertisements, to third-party publisher websites in exchange
for a portion of the revenues generated by such advertisements. Our business and operating results may be adversely affected if we do
not deliver ads in an effective manner, if publishers do not believe that advertisements served through RAC generate a competitive return
relative to alternative advertising networks, if we are unable to deliver sufficient advertising inventory to publishers, or if our advertising
marketplace technology becomes outmoded or outdated. If our relationship with third-party publishers terminates for any reason, or if
the commercial terms of our relationships are changed or do not continue to be renewed on favorable terms, we would need to secure and
integrate new publishers, which could negatively impact our revenues and profitability.

We
depend on third-party vendors, including internet service providers and data centers, to provide core services.

Although
we are building our own technical infrastructure, we depend on third-party vendors, including internet service providers and data centers
to, among other things, provide customer support, develop software, host videos uploaded by our users, transcode videos (compressing
a video file and converting it into a standard format optimized for streaming), stream videos to viewers, support our cloud services
offerings, and process payments. These vendors provide certain critical services to our technical infrastructure that are time-consuming
and costly for us to develop independently. Outages in those services would materially affect our video services and our ability to provide
cloud services. Outages may expose us to having to offer credits to subscribers, loss of subscribers, and reputational damage. We are
unlikely to be able to fully offset these losses with any credits we might receive from our vendors.

Technologies
that enable blocking of certain online advertisements, or that otherwise impair our ability to deliver advertising, could harm our operating
results.

Newly
developed technologies could block or obscure the display of or targeting of our content. For example, in June 2020, Apple announced
plans to require applications using its mobile operating systems to obtain an end user’s permission to track them or access their
device’s advertising identifier for advertising and advertising measurement purposes, as well as other restrictions that could
adversely affect our ability to deliver advertising, which could harm our operating results. Additionally, some providers of consumer
mobile devices and web browsers have implemented, or announced plans to implement, means to make it easier for internet users to prevent
the placement of cookies or to block other tracking technologies, which could, if widely adopted, result in the use of third-party cookies
and other methods of online tracking becoming significantly less effective and have a significant impact on our ability to monetize our
user base.

Our
ability to generate revenue depends on the development and availability of tools to accurately measure the effectiveness of advertisements
on our platform.

Most
advertisers rely on tools that measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns or that verify viewability of their ads on a platform
in order to allocate their advertising spend among various formats and platforms. If we are unable to measure the effectiveness of advertising
on our platform or we are unable to convince advertisers that our platform should be part of a larger advertising budget, our ability
to increase the demand and pricing of our advertising products and maintain or scale our advertising revenue may be limited. Our tools
may be less developed than those of other platforms with which we compete for advertising spend, in particular relative to those platforms
that collect more personal information than we do. Therefore, our ability to develop and offer tools that accurately measure the effectiveness
of a campaign or verify ad viewability on our platform will be critical to our ability to attract new advertisers and retain, and increase
spend from, our existing advertisers.

Developing
and improving these tools may require significant time and resources and additional investment, and in some cases we rely on third parties
to provide data and the technology needed to provide certain measurement or verification data to our advertisers. If we cannot continue
to develop and improve our advertising tools in a timely and cost-effective fashion, or if such tools are unreliable, difficult to use,
or otherwise unsatisfactory to our advertisers, or if the measurement or verification results are inconsistent with our advertisers’
goals, our advertising revenue could be negatively impacted, which in turn could adversely affect our business and operating results.

15

Our
cloud services business relies on a small number of key third-party service providers and a small number of customer relationships, the
disruption of which could harm our operating results.

As
we continue to expand our cloud services offerings, we have entered into agreements with certain third-party service providers. The success
of our future business activities in the cloud services space may depend upon such existing third-party providers, some of which may
compete with us in other lines of business. If our existing third-party service agreements terminate for any reason, or if the commercial
terms of such agreements are changed or do not continue to be renewed on favorable terms, we would need to enter into new third-party
service agreements, which could negatively impact our revenues, ability to attract future cloud services customers, public reputation,
and profitability.

In
addition, our initial cloud service offerings revolve around a small number of customer relationships. If we fail to deliver our product
to the desired specifications of these initial customers, or if these initial customers terminate their cloud services agreements for
any reason, future customers may doubt our ability to offer cloud services, which would negatively impact our revenues, public reputation,
and profitability.

The
loss of key personnel, or failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future, could harm our business.

Our
success depends upon our ability to attract and retain our senior officers and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in
the future. The loss of services of members of our senior management team and the uncertain transition of new members of our senior management
team may strain our ability to execute our strategic initiatives, or make it more difficult to retain customers, attract or maintain
our capital support, or meet other needs of our business. We may incur significant costs to attract and retain qualified personnel, and
we may lose new employees to our competitors before we realize the benefit of our investment in recruiting them. If we fail to attract
new personnel or if we suffer increases in costs or business operations interruptions as a result of a labor dispute, or fail to retain
and motivate our current personnel, we might not be able to operate our business effectively or efficiently, serve our customers properly
or maintain the quality of our content and services. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies with respect to our employees.

If
our users do not continue to contribute content or their contributions are not perceived as valuable to other users, we may experience
a decline in user growth, retention, and engagement on Rumble, Locals or RAC, which could result in the loss of advertisers and revenue.

An
important aspect of our success is our ability to provide Rumble users with engaging content, which in part depends on the content contributed
by our users. If users, including influential users, do not continue to contribute engaging content to Rumble, our user growth, retention,
and engagement may decline. That, in turn, may impair our ability to maintain good relationships with our advertisers or to attract new
advertisers, which may seriously harm our business and operating results.

The
loss of a material portion of our existing content creators, or our failure to recruit new content creators, may materially harm our
business and results of operations.

We
rely on our existing content creators, and on the recruiting of new content creators. The loss of a material portion of our existing
content creators could result in material harm to our business and results of operations. In the recent past, our ability to recruit
and maintain content creators may have been in part due to trends in American politics, where certain commentators have sought a neutral
internet platform. A change in such trends, including possible changes to competing platforms’ moderation policies that make those
platforms more hospitable to a diverse range of viewpoints, could result in the loss of existing content creators or a failure to recruit
new content creators, which may materially harm our business and results of operations. Recently, one of our popular content creators,
Dan Bongino, accepted a position in the Trump Administration as Deputy Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and it is possible
that additional prominent content creators may pursue other career opportunities, in government, politics or otherwise that may interrupt
their activities on Rumble. Additionally, as we expand into international markets, we may fail to recruit new content creators in those
markets, limiting our appeal to international audiences.

We
have offered and intend to continue to offer incentives, including economic incentives, to content creators to join our platform, and
these arrangements may involve fixed payment obligations that are not contingent on actual revenue or performance metrics generated by
the applicable content creator but rather are based on our modeled financial projections for that creator, which if not satisfied may
adversely impact our financial performance, results of operations and liquidity.

Our
user base and user engagement growth are directly driven by the content available on our platform. We have acquired and expect to continue
to acquire content by providing economic incentives, including minimum guaranteed earnings, to a limited number of content creators,
including sports leagues. These incentives have included and may continue to include equity grants and cash payments. This content acquisition
strategy is intended to allow us to enter key content verticals and secure top content creators in those verticals before we have full
monetization capabilities in place. Our present focus is to grow users and usage consumption and experiment with monetization levers,
which may not maximize profitability in the immediate term, but which we believe positions our business for the long term. As of December
31, 2024, we had entered into programming and content agreements with a minimum contractual cash commitment of $30 million. In addition
to the minimum contractual cash commitments, we have programming and content agreements that have variable cost arrangements. These future
costs are dependent upon many factors and are difficult to anticipate, however, these costs may be substantial. To the extent our revenue
and/or user growth assumptions associated with any particular creator do not meet our expectations, our financial performance, results
of operations and liquidity may be negatively impacted, since a failure to achieve these expectations is not expected to reduce our fixed
payment obligations to any such creator.

In
addition, when these programming and content agreements expire, content creators may choose to leave the Rumble video platform in favor
of competing platforms, especially if competing platforms offer superior monetization opportunities. Creators may choose to leave our
platform for other monetization-related reasons. For example, we currently do not apportion revenues related to Rumble Premium, our subscription
service that provides users ad-free access to our content, among content creators. The loss of a material portion of our existing content
creators could result in reductions to our user base and material harm to our business and results of operations.

We
have made, and may in the future make, acquisitions, and such acquisitions could disrupt our operations, and may have an adverse effect
on our operating results.

In
order to expand our business, we have made acquisitions and may continue making similar acquisitions and possibly larger acquisitions
as part of our growth strategy. The success of our future growth strategy will depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete
and integrate acquisitions and, if necessary, to obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing to fund those acquisitions. Acquisitions
are inherently risky, and any acquisitions we complete may not be successful. Our past acquisitions and any mergers and acquisitions
that we may undertake in the future involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to, the following:

●
difficulties
                                            in integrating and managing the operations, personnel, systems, technologies, and products
                                            of the companies we acquire;

●
diversion
                                            of our management’s attention from normal daily operations of our business;

●
our
                                            inability to maintain the key business relationships and the reputations of the acquired
                                            businesses;

●
uncertainty
                                            of entry into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience;

●
costs
                                            related to acquired operations and continuing support and development of acquired products;

●
businesses
                                            that we acquire may have greater-than-expected liabilities for which we become responsible;

●
potential
                                            impairment of goodwill and intangible assets related to the acquired businesses;

●
adverse
                                            tax consequences associated with acquisitions;

●
changes
                                            accounting for our acquisitions under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S.
                                            GAAP”), including arrangements that we assume from an acquisition;

●
potential
                                            negative perceptions of our acquisitions by customers, financial markets or investors;

●
failure
                                            to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under antitrust laws on a timely
                                            basis, if at all, which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a
                                            transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected goals of an acquisition;

●
potential
                                            loss of key employees of the companies we acquire;

17

●
potential
                                            security vulnerabilities in acquired products that expose us to additional security risks
                                            or delay our ability to integrate the product into our service offerings;

●
difficulties
                                            in applying security standards for acquired technology consistent with our other services;

●
ineffective
                                            or inadequate controls, procedures and policies at the acquired company;

●
inadequate
                                            protection of acquired intellectual property rights; and

●
potential
                                            failure to achieve the expected benefits on a timely basis or at all.

Additionally,
acquisitions or asset purchases made entirely or partially for cash may reduce our cash reserves or require us to obtain financing. We
may seek to obtain additional cash to fund an acquisition by selling equity or debt securities. We may be unable to secure the equity
or debt funding necessary to finance future acquisitions on terms that are acceptable to us. If we finance acquisitions by issuing equity
or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders will experience ownership dilution. The occurrence of any of these risks could
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, particularly in the case of
a larger acquisition or substantially concurrent acquisitions.

We
are subject to cybersecurity risks and interruptions or failures in our information technology systems. Notwithstanding our efforts,
a cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.

We
rely on sophisticated information technology systems and infrastructure to support our business. At the same time, cyber incidents, including
deliberate attacks, are prevalent and have increased globally in recent years. It is possible that new, escalated or ongoing military
conflicts, including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and Israel-Hamas war, could result in increased cyber-attacks or cybersecurity incidents
by state actors or others. Our technologies, systems and networks and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners may
become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring,
misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business operations. In addition, certain cyber
incidents, such as surveillance or vulnerabilities in widely used open source software, may remain undetected for an extended period.
Our systems for protecting against cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. Like most major online platforms, Rumble is routinely targeted
by cyberattacks that can result in interruptions to our services. We have observed an increase in such attacks as our reach expands and
we expect these attacks to continue in the future. As the sophistication of cyber incidents continues to evolve, we are and will likely
continue to be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and
remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. Additionally, any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods,
power loss, telecommunications failures, usage errors by employees, computer viruses, cyber-attacks or other security breaches or similar
events. The failure of any of our information technology systems may cause disruptions in our operations, which could adversely affect
our revenues and profitability, and lead to claims related to the disruption of our services from users of the Rumble platform, advertisers,
and customers of our cloud services.

Spam
activity, including inauthentic and fraudulent user activity, if undetected, may contribute, from time to time, to some amount of overstatement
of our performance indicators and may negatively impact our reputation.

Like
other major online platforms, spam activity, including inauthentic and fraudulent user activity, if undetected, may contribute, from
time to time, to some amount of overstatement of our performance indicators, including reporting of MAUs by Google Analytics, our third-party
analytics provider. We also use paid advertising in order to attract users to our platform; however, we cannot be certain that all or
substantially all activity that results from such advertising is genuine. Real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our
reputation and negatively affect our business. We continually seek to improve our ability to estimate the total number of spam-generated
users and eliminate them from the calculation of our MAUs; however, we will not succeed in identifying and removing all spam.

Our
cloud services business may not achieve success, and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could
be adversely affected.

Our
ongoing expansion into the cloud service business may not be successful and involves various risks relating to this business that may
negatively affect our operating results. In addition to other risks related to our cloud services business described in these “Risk
Factors,” such risks include risks related to:

●
our
                                            ability to derive an optimal pricing model that enables us to derive sufficient value from
                                            our customers while attracting new customers and retaining existing customers;

●
our
                                            ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, particularly software and cloud
                                            engineers and sales and customer experience personnel;

●
the
                                            possibility that we may be unable to maintain and improve our platform performance, especially
                                            during peak usage times;

●
the
                                            possibility that service outages or disruptions negatively impact customer relationships,
                                            leading to financial losses and reputational harm;

●
the
                                            possibility that we may underestimate or overestimate our data center capacity requirements
                                            and our capital expenditures on data centers, servers and equipment;

●
our
                                            ability to obtain or retain standard industry security certifications for our platform and
                                            products;

●
our
                                            exposure to possible liability, regulatory actions, and harm to our reputation if the security
                                            of our cloud is breached, resulting in the exposure of our customers’ data, including
                                            personal information, to cyber criminals and other nefarious actors;

●
hosting
                                            by our cloud customers of illegal content, such as pirated media, could result in negative
                                            regulatory actions, including pursuant to the DMCA and the EU E-Commerce Directive, resulting
                                            in monetary penalties and forced operational halts;

●
the
                                            possibility that we may be unable to maintain the compatibility of our platform with third-party
                                            applications that our customers use in their businesses; and

●
our
                                            ability to respond to rapid technological changes with new solutions and services offerings.

The
occurrence of any of these factors, or our inability to successfully mitigate the results of the associated impact, could also damage
our reputation, negatively impact our relationship with our customers, and otherwise materially harm our business, results of operations,
and financial condition.

Risks
related to our e-commerce business may result in our broader business, financial condition and results of operations being adversely
affected.

Our
partnerships through which we sell Rumble-branded products through our online store involve various risks that may negatively affect
our operating results, including:

●
expansion
                                            into new brands, products, services, and technologies will subject us to additional reputational,
                                            business, legal, regulatory and financial risks;

●
inability
                                            to build and maintain strong brands, including due to unfavorable customer feedback and negative
                                            publicity;

●
notwithstanding
                                            agreements by our partners to assume liability for the Rumble-branded products they place
                                            in our online store, we may be subject to product liability and similar claims and regulatory
                                            actions if products sold through our store result in harm, personal injury, death, or environmental
                                            or property damage;

●
risks
                                            related to additional tax liabilities and collection obligations;

●
market
                                            competition could adversely affect prices and demand for the Rumble-branded products we distribute;

●
disruptions
                                            in our supply chain and other factors affecting the availability and distribution of our
                                            products could adversely impact our business; and

●
risks
                                            related to online transactions and payment methods.

The
occurrence of any of these factors, or our inability to successfully mitigate the results of the associated impact, could also damage
our reputation, negatively impact our relationships with our customers, and otherwise materially harm our business, results of operations,
and financial condition.

19

Negative media campaigns may adversely impact
our financial performance, results of operations, and relationships with our business partners, including content creators and advertisers.

Our commitment to diversity
of opinion and refusal to censor otherwise allowable content on our platforms that does not violate our moderation policy has in the past
resulted and is likely to continue to result in malicious media campaigns and advertiser boycotts directed against us. For example, in
August 2024, we filed a lawsuit against the World Federation of Advertisers, as well as the advertising agency WPP and its subsidiary
GroupM. Our lawsuit alleges that an initiative called the Global Alliance for Responsible Media (GARM), created by the WFA, established
arbitrary and biased standards for the content on digital platforms where its members may want to advertise. GARM used those one-size-fits-all
biased standards to perpetrate an advertiser boycott against Rumble and other platforms that did not censor content that GARM disliked.
The suit also notes that GARM has vast reach since it counts the six largest ad agency holding companies among its members, including
defendant WPP. We subsequently amended our complaint to add Diageo plc as a defendant.

Media campaigns and advertising
boycotts against us may be intended to interfere with our relationships with streaming partners and advertisers, and these campaigns and
boycotts may intensify if political polarization increases in the United States and Canada.

We expect that the proliferation
of alternative media, including on our platform, will continue to be viewed as a growing competitive threat by established news organizations,
and may result in an escalation, both in frequency and intensity, of negative publicity campaigns against us and our creators. Such campaigns,
even if groundless in nature, may result in negative public perception and damage to relationships with our business partners, including
additional or more intense advertiser boycotts, which may negatively impact our operating results and future growth potential.

Our management team has limited experience
managing a public company, which exposes us to additional risks, including the risk that we cannot enhance, maintain, and adhere to our
internal controls and procedures.

Some members of our management
team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with public company investors, and complying with the increasingly
complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a
public company that is subject to significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the
continuous scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituents will require significant attention from
our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could harm our business,
results of operations, and financial condition.

Additionally, as a public
company, we are subject to significant requirements for enhanced financial reporting and internal controls. The process of designing and
implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and
the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate
to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company, and we are still in the process of generating a mature system of internal controls
and integration across business systems. Inability to establish or maintain appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures
may result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements and failure to meet our reporting obligations on a timely
basis, causing harm to our operating results.

Matters impacting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to
report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the
SEC or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules, which may result in a breach of the covenants under existing or future financing
arrangements. There also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability
of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also could suffer if we continue to report a material
weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. This could materially adversely affect us and lead to a decline in the market
price of our securities.

We have identified material weaknesses in
our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. If we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses, we may
not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations.

Effective internal control
over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published
consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As described under Item 9A “Controls and Procedures” of this
Annual Report on Form 10-K, in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024 and for
the year then ended, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.

20

A material weakness is a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We identified
material weaknesses in our internal control over our financial statement close process specifically related to an insufficient complement
of accounting and finance personnel with the necessary U.S. GAAP technical expertise to timely identify and account for complex or non-routine
transactions.

As of December 31, 2024, the
Company identified material weaknesses corresponding to the control activities component of internal control under the COSO Framework.
Specifically, we did not adequately design certain key controls at a sufficient level of precision, including account reconciliation,
to address relevant financial reporting risks including inadequate design of procedures to ensure completeness and accuracy of the accounting
for content creator agreements, and associated assets, liabilities and expenses. Deficiencies in control activities contributed to the
potential for there to have been material accounting errors in financial statement account balances and disclosures. While the above material
weaknesses did not result in a material misstatement of our previously issued financial statements, it could result in a misstatement
of our account balances or disclosures that would not be prevented or detected and would therefore result in a material misstatement of
our annual or interim financial statements.

We are working to remediate
the material weaknesses and are taking steps to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting through the continued hiring
of additional appropriately skilled finance and accounting personnel with the requisite technical knowledge and skills. With the additional
skilled personnel, we are taking appropriate and reasonable steps to remediate these material weaknesses through formalization of accounting
policies and controls around content creator agreements, and retention of external accounting advisors for complex accounting transactions.
We will not be able to fully remediate these control deficiencies until these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively
for a sufficient period of time. The hiring of additional finance and accounting personnel and the implementation of improvements to our
accounting and proprietary systems and controls may be costly and time consuming.

We cannot assure you that
the measures we have taken to date and those we expect to take in the future will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses we
identified or avoid the identification of additional material weaknesses in the future. If the steps we take do not remediate the material
weaknesses in a timely manner, there could continue to be a reasonable possibility that these material weaknesses or other control deficiencies
could result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely
basis, which could in turn cause our stock price to decline significantly and make raising capital more difficult. If we fail to remediate
our material weaknesses, identify future material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or fail to meet the demands
that will be placed upon us as a public company, including the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley, we may be unable to accurately report our
financial results or report them within the timeframes required by law or stock exchange regulations. Failure to comply with Section 404
of Sarbanes-Oxley could also potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. If additional
material weaknesses exist or are discovered in the future, and we are unable to remediate any such material weakness, our reputation,
results of operations and financial condition could suffer.

Our recently implemented Bitcoin treasury
strategy exposes us to various risks associated with holding Bitcoin.

We have invested and plan
to continue to invest a portion of our corporate treasury in Bitcoin as a reserve asset, exposing us to significant financial, operational,
and regulatory risks due to its characteristics that are specific to cryptocurrencies. The value of Bitcoin is highly volatile and subject
to rapid, material, and unpredictable fluctuations driven by market speculation, macroeconomic conditions, investor sentiment, and global
events. For example, historical price swings have seen Bitcoin decline by more than 50% in a matter of months, and there can be no assurance
that similar or greater declines will not occur in the future. Such volatility could result in material reductions in the value of our
Bitcoin holdings, adversely impacting our financial condition, liquidity, and reported earnings, particularly if we are required to recognize
impairment losses under applicable accounting standards.

21

The regulatory environment
surrounding Bitcoin remains uncertain and varies widely across jurisdictions. In the United States, federal and state authorities have
issued evolving guidance on the classification, taxation, and permissible uses of cryptocurrencies, but comprehensive legislation and
regulation is still pending. Potential future legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level,
such as new trading compliance obligations, custody requirements, restrictions on ownership, trading, transfer, exchange, or use of Bitcoin
as a corporate asset, or the imposition of new taxes or reporting requirements, could limit our ability to hold, sell, or utilize our
Bitcoin effectively, and may adversely affect the value of Bitcoin. Unregulated trading platforms and intermediaries may not provide certain
important investor protections.

Our Bitcoin holdings are stored
in digital wallets on third-party exchanges, which are vulnerable to cybersecurity threats such as hacking, phishing, or loss of private
keys. Transactions in Bitcoin may be irreversible, and accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable.
A security breach or operational failure, whether due to internal errors, errors of third-party custodians, or external attacks, could
result in the permanent loss or theft of our Bitcoin, for which there is no recourse or insurance comparable to traditional financial
assets. For example, high-profile cryptocurrency exchange hacks have resulted in losses of hundreds of millions of dollars, and we cannot
guarantee that the safeguards that are available to us will prevent similar incidents. Bitcoin is not protected by either FDIC or SIPC
insurance. Additionally, reliance on third-party custodians introduces counterparty risk, as their insolvency or mismanagement could jeopardize
our access to these assets.

Market perception of our Bitcoin
strategy poses further risks. Investors, analysts, or customers may view our investment as speculative or misaligned with our core business,
potentially leading to stock price volatility or loss of confidence in our management’s financial strategy. Conversely, if Bitcoin’s
value declines significantly, we may face pressure to divest at a loss, incurring transaction costs and tax implications. The accounting
treatment of Bitcoin as an indefinite-lived intangible asset under U.S. GAAP requires us to assess for impairment periodically, which
could lead to earnings volatility and negatively affect our financial statements, even if we do not intend to sell.

Broader market or technological
developments, such as shifts in blockchain adoption, competition from other cryptocurrencies, or disruptions to the Bitcoin network, such
as forks, mining centralization, or energy regulation, could also diminish the value or utility of our holdings. Moreover, macroeconomic
factors, such as rising interest rates, inflation, or shifts in monetary policy, may reduce institutional interest in Bitcoin, further
depressing its value. These risks are heightened by ongoing debates over cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. and globally, which remain
unresolved and could materially impact our investment.

Our decision to hold Bitcoin
involves speculative risks that differ significantly from traditional treasury assets like cash or government securities. There can be
no assurance that this strategy will achieve our objectives, including the objectives of preserving capital or enhancing returns, and
any adverse developments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and stock price.

accepting certain stablecoins as a medium of exchange will expose us to additional financial, regulatory, operational, and market risks
that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Although stablecoins are designed
to maintain a stable value while being pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, the stability and reliability of stablecoins are
not guaranteed and depend on various factors beyond our control, including the financial health of the issuing entity, the adequacy and
liquidity of reserve assets, and the effectiveness of the underlying stabilization mechanisms. If a stablecoin that we accept experiences
a significant devaluation or “de-pegging” event, where its value deviates materially from its intended peg, we may incur losses
on payments already received, face disruptions in transaction processing, or lose customer confidence, all of which could negatively impact
our financial condition and reputation. Stablecoins are not subject to any deposit insurance protection scheme, and the presence of fiat
currency reserves is not a guarantee for redemption. There is a possibility that the assets held in reserves are not sufficient or may
not be available for redemption at times of extremely high demand. Volatility spikes in the cryptocurrency markets also might lead to
occasions where the price of a stablecoin deviates from the underlying fiat currency.

22

Additionally, the regulatory
environment surrounding stablecoins remains uncertain and rapidly evolving. Legislatures and regulatory bodies, including foreign authorities,
continue to evaluate whether stablecoins constitute securities, commodities, or other regulated financial instruments. New laws, regulations,
or enforcement actions could impose significant compliance obligations on us, such as anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer
(KYC) requirements, restrict our ability to accept certain stablecoins altogether, result in unfavorable changes in use, transfer, and
redemption of stablecoins, or impose tax liabilities upon stablecoin holders. Noncompliance with such regulations, even unintentional,
could result in fines, penalties, legal proceedings, and reputational harm. Furthermore, if a stablecoin issuer on which we rely is deemed
non-compliant with applicable laws, it could disrupt our payment operations or expose us to liability as a downstream user.

Accepting stablecoins also
introduces operational and cybersecurity risks. The blockchain networks and digital wallets we use to process and store stablecoin transactions
may be vulnerable to hacking, phishing attacks, software bugs, and network failures. A security breach or technical failure could result
in the loss or theft of stablecoin funds, for which we may have limited recourse due to the decentralized and irreversible nature of blockchain
transactions. Moreover, reliance on third-party service providers, such as cryptocurrency exchanges or custodians, to facilitate stablecoin
transactions introduces counterparty risk. If these providers, or any stablecoin issuers, experience insolvency, operational disruptions,
or fraudulent activity, our ability to process payments or convert stablecoins to fiat currency could be impaired, potentially leading
to financial losses or liquidity constraints.

Additional risks relate to
the market acceptance of stablecoins. If customers or vendors lose confidence in stablecoins due to volatility, scandals, or legislative
or regulatory actions, demand for our stablecoin payment option could decline, forcing us to incur costs to adapt our payment infrastructure
or revert to traditional payment methods. Conversely, if we cease accepting stablecoins in response to these risks, we may alienate a
segment of our customer base that prefers cryptocurrency payments, potentially reducing our market competitiveness.

Fluctuations in the broader
cryptocurrency market could indirectly impact our stablecoin operations. A significant downturn in cryptocurrency prices or public sentiment
could trigger redemption pressures on stablecoin issuers, straining their reserves and increasing the likelihood of instability. Such
events could disrupt our payment processing capabilities and harm our financial position.

The development and use of AI may result
in reputational harm, liability, or other adverse consequences to our business operations.

We are evaluating AI technologies
for use in the operation of our business. There are significant risks involved in deploying AI and there can be no assurance that any
usage of AI will enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our business, including our profitability. AI technologies are complex
and rapidly evolving, and we face significant potential disruption from other companies as well as an evolving regulatory landscape. Any
integration of any AI technologies into our products or services may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, intellectual
property claims, litigation, confidentiality or security risks, ethical concerns, negative user perceptions as to automation and AI, or
other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results. As a result of the complexity and rapid
development of AI, it is also the subject of evolving review by various U.S. governmental and regulatory agencies, and other foreign jurisdictions
are applying, or are considering applying, their platform moderation, intellectual property, cybersecurity, and data protection laws to
AI and/or are considering general legal frameworks on AI. We may not always be able to anticipate the appropriate response to these rapidly
evolving frameworks. We may also have to expend resources to adjust our product or service offerings in certain jurisdictions if the legal
frameworks governing the use of AI are not consistent across jurisdictions. If we fail to adopt AI technologies effectively or experience
delays in integrating these technologies into our operations, we may face significant risks to our competitive position, financial performance,
and long-term growth prospects. Competitors who successfully leverage AI may gain advantages in operational efficiency, innovation, data
analysis, and customer personalization, potentially eroding our market share and reputation.

23

Uncertainty around new and
emerging AI technologies, such as generative AI, may require additional investment in the development of appropriate protections and safeguards
for handling the use of data with AI technologies, which may be costly and could impact our expenses. AI technologies, including generative
AI, may create content that is factually inaccurate or flawed, or otherwise unlawful, harmful or policy-violating. Such content may expose
us to brand or reputational harm and/or legal liability. It is also uncertain how various laws related to online services, intermediary
liability, copyright and other issues will apply to content generated by AI. The use of certain AI technologies presents emerging ethical
and social issues, and if we offer solutions that draw scrutiny or controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on users or on
society as a whole, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, and/or legal liability. As such, it is not possible
to predict all of the risks related to the use of AI, and developments in regulatory frameworks governing the use of AI and in related
stakeholder expectations may adversely affect our ability to develop and use AI or subject us to liability.

Risks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment in Which We
Operate

We collect, store, and process large amounts
of user video content and personal information of our users and subscribers. If our security measures are breached, our sites and applications
may be perceived as not being secure, traffic and advertisers may curtail or stop viewing our content or using our services, our business
and operating results could be harmed, and we could face legal claims from users and subscribers.

We collect, store, and process
large amounts of video content (including videos that are not intended for public consumption) and personal information of our users,
cloud customers, and subscribers. We also share such information, where appropriate, with third parties that help us operate our business.
Despite our efforts, we may fail to properly secure our systems and our user and subscriber data. This could be caused by technical issues
(bugs), obsolete technology, human error or internal or external malfeasance, undiscovered vulnerabilities, and could lead to unauthorized
disclosure of data, unauthorized changes or data losses. For example, we routinely receive reports from security researchers regarding
potential vulnerabilities in our applications. We also rely on open-source software for various functions, which may contain undiscovered
security flaws and create additional technical vulnerabilities. In addition, despite our ongoing and additional investments in cybersecurity,
such improvements and review may not identify abuses of our platforms and misuse of user data. The existence of such vulnerabilities,
if undetected or detected but not remediated, could result in unauthorized access to our systems or the data of our users.

A data breach could expose
us to regulatory actions and litigation. Depending on the circumstances, we may be required to disclose a suspected breach to regulators,
affected individuals, and the public. This could lead to regulatory actions, including the possibility of fines, class action or traditional
litigation by affected individuals, reputational harm, costly investigation and remedial efforts, the triggering of indemnification obligations
under data-protection agreements with subscribers, vendors, and partners, higher premiums for cybersecurity insurance and other insurance
policies, and the inability to obtain cybersecurity insurance or other forms of insurance. We do not presently have cybersecurity insurance
to compensate for any losses that may result from any breach of security, and given industry trends generally, we expect that any such
cybersecurity insurance coverage will be difficult to obtain in the future on acceptable terms. As a result, our results of operations
or financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we experience a cybersecurity-related loss.

We may fail to comply with applicable privacy
laws.

We are subject to data privacy
and security laws and regulations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage, use, processing, destruction, retention and security
of personal information, including additional laws or regulations relating to health information. Our current privacy policies and practices,
which are publicly available at rumble.com/s/privacy, are designed to comply with privacy and data protection laws in the United States
and Canada. These policies and practices inform users how we handle personal information and, as permitted by law, allow users to change
or delete the personal information in their user accounts. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues
to evolve in jurisdictions worldwide, and these laws may at times be conflicting. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and
applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices, and our efforts to comply with the evolving data protection rules may be
unsuccessful. We must devote significant resources to understanding and complying with this changing landscape. Failure to comply with
federal, state, provincial and international laws regarding privacy and security of personal information could expose us to penalties
under such laws, orders requiring that we change our practices, claims for damages or other liabilities, regulatory investigations and
enforcement action (including fines and criminal prosecution of employees), litigation, significant costs for remediation, and damage
to our reputation and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and prospects. Even if we have not violated these laws, government investigations and private lawsuits into these issues
typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Additionally, if we are unable to properly protect the privacy
and security of personal information, including protected health information, we could be found to have breached our contracts with certain
third parties.

24

There are numerous U.S. and
Canadian federal, state, and provincial laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information. Determining
whether protected information has been handled in compliance with applicable privacy standards and our contractual obligations can be
complex and may be subject to changing interpretation. If we fail to comply with applicable privacy laws, we could face civil and criminal
penalties. Failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure can also constitute unfair acts or practices
in or affecting commerce and be construed as a violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTCA”),
15 U.S.C. § 45(a). The Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable
and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and
the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. In addition, state attorneys general are authorized to bring
civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. We cannot
be sure how these regulations will be interpreted, enforced or applied to our operations. In addition to the risks associated with enforcement
activities and potential contractual liabilities, our ongoing efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations at the federal and
state level may be costly and require ongoing modifications to our policies, procedures and systems.

Internationally, laws, regulations
and standards in many jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, transmission, storage, use, processing, destruction, retention and
security of personal information. For example, in the European Union, the collection, transmission, storage, use, processing, destruction,
retention and security of personal data is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in
addition to other applicable laws and regulations. The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the European
Union Member States governing the collection, transmission, storage, use, processing, destruction, retention and security of personal
data, impose strict obligations with respect to, and restrictions on, the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer
and processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the European
Union that are not deemed to have protections for personal information, including the United States. The GDPR authorizes fines for certain
violations of up to 4% of the total global annual turnover of the preceding financial year or €20 million, whichever is greater.
Such fines are in addition to any civil litigation claims by data subjects. Separately, Brexit has led and could also lead to legislative
and regulatory changes and may increase our compliance costs and expose us to two parallel regulatory regimes, each of which authorizes
similar fines and other potentially divergent enforcement actions for certain violations. Other jurisdictions outside the European Union
are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules and regulations, which could increase our compliance costs
and the risks associated with noncompliance. We cannot guarantee that we are, or will be, in compliance with all applicable U.S., Canadian,
or other international regulations as they are enforced now or as they evolve.

Our cloud services business operates in
a highly regulated environment, subject to a complex and rapidly evolving array of domestic and international laws, regulations, and industry
standards governing data privacy, cybersecurity, data localization, and cross-border data transfers. 

Compliance with regulatory
requirements of a rapidly evolving array of domestic and international laws that apply to our cloud services business poses significant
operational, financial, and reputational risks. For example, we are subject to the GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and
its successor, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). As we further expand internationally, we may become subject to similar laws in
foreign jurisdictions. These regulations impose strict obligations on the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of personal data,
with potential penalties for noncompliance, in addition to litigation costs and reputational harm.

Furthermore, certain countries,
enforce data localization laws requiring that data generated within their borders be stored on local servers, which may conflict with
our global operational model and necessitate costly infrastructure investments or limit our ability to serve customers efficiently. Recent
U.S. trade policies, such as the tariffs imposed on goods from China, Canada, and Mexico, could exacerbate these challenges by increasing
tensions over cross-border data flows or prompting retaliatory measures that further restrict data transfers. The invalidation of frameworks
like the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and ongoing uncertainty surrounding alternative mechanisms, such as standard contractual clauses, heighten
the risk that we may be unable to lawfully transfer data across jurisdictions, potentially disrupting service delivery or subjecting us
to regulatory enforcement actions.

25

Our cloud services business
may also cater to customers in regulated industries, such as healthcare (subject to HIPAA), financial services (subject to PCI DSS and
SEC regulations), and government (subject to FedRAMP), each imposing additional compliance obligations. Failure to obtain or maintain
certifications, implement required security controls, or adequately audit our systems could result in loss of customer contracts, exclusion
from certain markets, or substantial penalties. Moreover, emerging regulations, such as the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act and
potential U.S. federal cybersecurity mandates, introduce further uncertainty, as their scope and enforcement remain unclear but could
require significant changes to our technology and operations.

Noncompliance, whether due
to inadvertent violations, evolving interpretations of existing laws, or breaches by third-party vendors we rely on, could lead to investigations,
fines, injunctions, or restrictions on our ability to operate in key markets. Even the perception of noncompliance could damage customer
trust and investor confidence, adversely affecting our stock price. The costs of compliance, including legal fees, system upgrades, and
ongoing audits, may increase over time and strain our financial resources, particularly if regulators impose conflicting requirements
across jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that our efforts to monitor and adapt to this dynamic regulatory landscape will be sufficient
to mitigate these risks, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results
of operations.

We operate across many domestic and international
jurisdictions which may subject us to cybersecurity, privacy, data security, data protection, and online content laws with uncertain interpretations.

International laws and regulations
relating to cybersecurity, privacy, data security, data protection, and online content often are more restrictive than those in the United
States. There is no harmonized approach to these laws and regulations globally. Consequently, as we expand internationally from Canada
and the United States, we increase our risk of noncompliance with applicable foreign data protection and online content laws, including
laws that expose us to civil or criminal penalties in certain jurisdictions for our content moderation decisions. We may need to change
and limit the way we use personal information in operating our business and may have difficulty maintaining a single operating model that
is compliant. In addition, various federal, state, provincial, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies, or self-regulatory organizations
may expand current laws or regulations, enact new laws or regulations or issue revised rules or guidance regarding cybersecurity, privacy,
data security, data protection and online content. Aspects of such laws can be unclear, resulting in further uncertainty and potentially
requiring us to modify our data practices and policies and to incur substantial additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply.
In addition, such laws may have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging.

Noncompliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery,
anti-money laundering, and similar laws can subject us to criminal or civil liability and harm our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

We are subject to the U.S.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), U.S. domestic bribery laws, and other anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws in the countries
in which we operate. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees
and their third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to
recipients in the public or private sector. As we increase our international presence, we may engage with business partners and third-party
intermediaries to market our products and to obtain necessary permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals, and may have direct or
indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable
for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners
and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.

Detecting, investigating,
and resolving actual or alleged violations of anti-corruption laws, and responding to any action, can require a significant diversion
of time, resources, and attention from senior management and significant defense costs and other professional fees. In addition, noncompliance
with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, or anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, various
penalties or debarment from contracting with certain persons, and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas or investigations are
launched, or sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible proceeding, our business, financial condition and results
of operations could be harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s
attention and resources.

26

Inadequate technical and legal intellectual
property protections could prevent us from defending or securing our proprietary technology and intellectual property.

Our success is dependent,
in part, upon protecting our proprietary information and technology. We may be unsuccessful in adequately protecting our intellectual
property. No assurance can be given that confidentiality, non-disclosure, or invention assignment agreements with employees, consultants,
or other parties will not be breached and will otherwise be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our platform or solutions,
or certain aspects of our platform or solutions, and proprietary information. Further, these agreements do not prevent our competitors
from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our platform or solutions. Additionally, certain
unauthorized use of our intellectual property may go undetected, or we may face legal or practical barriers to enforcing our legal rights
even where unauthorized use is detected.

Current law may not provide
for adequate protection of our platform or data. In addition, legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection
of proprietary rights in internet-related businesses are uncertain and evolving, and changes in these standards may adversely impact the
viability or value of our proprietary rights. Some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use, copying, transfer, and disclosure
of our platform, or certain aspects of our platform, or our data may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions. Further,
the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and mechanisms for enforcement
of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries may be inadequate. To the extent we expand our international activities, our
exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our data or certain aspects of our platform, or our data may increase. Competitors, foreign
governments, foreign government-backed actors, criminals, or other third parties may gain unauthorized access to our proprietary information
and technology. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our
technology and intellectual property.

To protect our intellectual
property rights, we will be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect these rights, and we may or may not be able
to detect infringement by our customers or third parties. Litigation has been and may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual
property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Such litigation could be costly, time consuming, and distracting to management and could
result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property
rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property
rights. Our inability to protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, as well as any costly litigation or diversion
of our management’s attention and resources, could delay further sales or the implementation of our platform or solutions, impair
the functionality of our platform or solutions, delay introductions of new features, integrations, and capabilities, result in our substituting
inferior or more costly technologies into our platform or solutions, or injure our reputation. In addition, we may be required to license
additional technology from third parties to develop and market new features, integrations, and capabilities, and we cannot be certain
that we could license that technology on commercially reasonable terms or at all, and our inability to license this technology could harm
our ability to compete.

We may be found to have infringed on the
intellectual property of others, which could expose us to substantial losses or restrict our operations.

Given the nature of our business
and as a publicly traded company, we have been, and expect to be, subject to legal claims that we have infringed the intellectual property
rights of others. To date, we have not fully evaluated the extent to which other parties may bring claims that our technology, including
our use of open source software, infringes on the intellectual property rights of others. The availability of damages and royalties and
the potential for injunctive relief have increased the costs associated with litigating and settling patent infringement claims. Any claims,
whether or not meritorious, could require us to spend significant time, money, and other resources in litigation, pay damages and royalties,
develop new intellectual property, modify, design around, or discontinue existing products, services, or features, or acquire licenses
to the intellectual property that is the subject of the infringement claims. These licenses, if required, may not be available on acceptable
terms or at all. As a result, intellectual property claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects,
financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

27

We may face liability for hosting content
that allegedly infringes on third-party copyright and trademark rights.

If content providers do not
have sufficient rights to the video content or other material that they upload or make available to Rumble, or if such video content or
other material infringes or is alleged to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, we could be subject to claims from
those third parties, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although our content policies
prohibit users from submitting infringing content to Rumble, and require users to indemnify Rumble for claims related to the violations
of the rights of third parties arising from the submission of content to Rumble (including with respect to infringements of intellectual
property rights), we do not verify that content providers own or have rights to all of the video content or other material that they upload
or make available. As a result, we may face potential liability for copyright or other intellectual property infringement, or other claims.
Litigation to defend these claims could be costly and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We can provide no assurance that we are adequately insured to cover claims related to user content or that our indemnification provisions
will be adequate to mitigate all liability that may be imposed on us as a result of claims related to user content.

We may face liability for hosting a variety
of tortious or unlawful materials uploaded by third parties, notwithstanding the liability protections of Section 230. In certain circumstances,
we may also voluntarily suspend access to our services indefinitely in certain jurisdictions in order to uphold our commitment to free
speech and diversity of opinion.

In the United States, Section
230 generally limits our liability for hosting tortious and otherwise illegal content. The immunities conferred by Section 230 could be
narrowed or eliminated through amendment, regulatory action or judicial interpretation. In 2018, Congress amended Section 230 to remove
immunities for content that promotes or facilitates sex trafficking and prostitution. In 2020, various members of Congress introduced
bills to further limit Section 230, and a petition was filed by a Department of Commerce entity with the Federal Communications Commission
to commence a rulemaking to further limit Section 230. Additionally, judicial decisions, including by the U.S. Supreme Court as well as
lower courts, may limit or alter the protections offered by Section 230.

Laws like Section 230 generally
do not exist outside of the United States, and some countries have enacted laws that require online content providers to remove certain
pieces of content within short time frames. If we fail to comply with such laws, we could be subject to prosecution or regulatory proceedings,
or we may choose voluntarily to suspend access to our services indefinitely in the applicable jurisdiction in order to uphold our commitment
to free speech and diversity of opinion, as we did in France beginning in November 2022 and in Brazil beginning in December 2023. These
and any similar future suspensions may limit our user and revenue growth, which in turn may adversely affect our business and operating
results. In addition, some countries may decide to ban our service based upon a single piece of content.

We may also face liability
when we remove content and accounts that we believe are violating our terms of service. While Rumble believes that Section 230 allows
us to restrict or remove certain categories of content, our protections may not always end a lawsuit at an early stage, potentially resulting
in costly and time-consuming litigation.

The incentives that we offer to certain
content creators may lead to liability based on the actions of those creators.

Our goal is to attract even
more top creators to our platform, further accelerating our platform’s growth, and we have offered and intend to continue to offer
incentives, including economic incentives, to content creators to join our platform, even while the content creators maintain sole editorial
control over the content they produce. These incentives have included and may continue to include equity grants or cash payments, including
arrangements under which we may agree to pay fixed compensation to a content creator (in certain cases, for multiple years) irrespective
of whether the actual revenue or user growth generated by the applicable content creator on our platform meets our original modeled financial
projections for that creator.

28

While we believe that the
incentives we offer to certain content creators do not alter our liability protections under Section 230, it is possible that future judicial
interpretations of the statute will lead to liability for tortious or unlawful materials uploaded to Rumble by those content creators.

In addition, as part of the
incentives we offer to certain content creators, Rumble has the right to sell host-read advertisements. As part of these advertisements,
the content creator offers a paid endorsement of various products or services. Although we follow FTC guidelines regarding endorsements
and require our creators to do the same, we could face liability if creators fail to follow those guidelines or otherwise engage in misleading
or deceptive advertising.

User-generated content could affect the
quality of our services and deter current or potential users from using our platforms, and we may face negative publicity for removing,
or declining to remove, certain content, regardless of whether such content violated any law.

Individuals and groups may
upload controversial content to our platform that does not violate our terms of service. Removing or failing to remove such content may
result in negative publicity, which could harm our efforts to attract and retain users and subscribers. We have also faced criticism from
users and subscribers for removing content and terminating accounts in compliance with the DMCA. Further, we must continually manage and
monitor our content and detect content that violates our terms of service. This content moderation service is provided by Cosmic, a key
vendor, and we would experience a significant disruption if Cosmic were no longer able or willing to offer us that service. If a significant
amount of content that violates our terms of service were not detected and removed by us in a timely manner, or if a significant amount
of information was perceived by users or the media to violate our terms of service, whether or not such perceptions were accurate, our
brand, business and reputation could be harmed. This risk increases as the volume of content uploaded by users to Rumble continues to
grow.

In the event our content creators,
other users, advertisers, or other key business partners do not agree with our content moderation policies and procedures or their implementation,
such creators, other users, advertisers, and other key business partners could decrease their usage of Rumble (or cease using Rumble entirely),
which could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations. Additionally, there is a risk that users will
upload content that predominantly represents certain political viewpoints, leading to public perceptions that Rumble endorses those viewpoints,
regardless of whether such perceptions are accurate. There can be no guarantee that current or future negative publicity, complaints,
allegations, political controversies, investigations or legal proceedings with respect to our content, even if baseless, will not generate
adverse publicity that could damage our reputation. Any damage to our reputation could harm our ability to attract and retain users and
subscribers.

Changes in tax rates, changes in tax treatment
of companies engaged in e-commerce, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities
may adversely impact our financial results.

We are subject to taxes in
multiple jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes is based on a jurisdictional mix of earnings, statutory tax rates and enacted tax
rules, including transfer pricing. There may also be tax costs associated with distributions between our subsidiaries. Due to economic
and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. As a result, our future effective tax
rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of
deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. These changes may adversely impact our effective
tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.

We regularly assess the likelihood
of adverse outcomes resulting from examinations by the Internal Revenue Service and other domestic and foreign tax authorities to determine
the adequacy of our income tax and other tax reserves. If our reserves are not sufficient to cover these contingencies, such inadequacy
could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. In addition, due to
the global nature of the internet, various states or foreign countries may attempt to impose additional or new regulation on our business
or levy additional or new taxes relating to our activities. Tax authorities at the international, federal, state and local levels are
currently reviewing the appropriate treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce. New or revised tax regulations or court decisions may
subject us or our customers to additional sales, income and other taxes. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, and operating results.

29

We are currently under or
subject to examination for indirect taxes in various states, municipalities and foreign jurisdictions. Management currently believes we
have adequate reserves established for these matters. If a material indirect tax liability associated with prior periods were to be recorded,
for which there is not a reserve, it could materially affect our financial results for the period in which it is recorded.

Compliance obligations imposed by new privacy
laws, laws regulating online video-sharing and other platforms and online speech in certain jurisdictions in which we operate, or industry
practices may adversely affect our business and operating results.

New laws could restrict our
ability to conduct marketing by, for example, restricting the emailing or targeting users or use certain technologies like artificial
intelligence. Similarly, private-market participants may deploy technologies or require certain practices that limit our ability to obtain
or use certain information about our users and subscribers. For example, Google has indicated that it will ultimately phase out the use
of cookies to track users of its search services in future versions of its Chrome web browser, and Apple has updated its iOS mobile operating
system to require app developers to obtain opt-in consent before tracking users of its various services. If these types of changes are
implemented, our ability to determine how our users and subscribers use our video services and ability to use targeted advertising in
a cost-effective manner may be limited. New laws in Canada, along with laws under consideration in the European Union and other jurisdictions
in which we operate, may also require us to change our content moderation practices or privacy policies in ways that harm our business
or create the risk of fines or other penalties for noncompliance.

We may become subject to newly enacted laws
and regulations that restrict content on the internet.

The expansion of regulatory
and censorship regimes by governments around the world is likely to limit the freedom of speech and artistic expression on the internet,
which in turn may inhibit the growth of alternative and nontraditional platforms like Rumble relative to traditional media publishers
and established technology platforms that feature stricter content moderation. For example, Canada’s Bill C-11, also known as the
Online Streaming Act, grants Canadian regulatory authorities significantly increased regulatory powers over audiovisual content on the
internet. While we do not currently meet the regulatory criteria to comply with C-11, our commitment to a free and open internet may result
in governmental actions against our platform, costly and prolonged legal challenges, and the prohibition or suppression of our platform
in certain jurisdictions or our voluntary withdrawal from such jurisdictions.

The European Union (EU) has
recently intensified its efforts to regulate online speech, primarily through the Digital Services Act (DSA), which came into effect in
2023. The DSA imposes strict requirements on digital services providers to combat “illegal” content, including “hate
speech” and “disinformation,” with significant fines for noncompliance. EU politicians have issued warnings to online
platforms over content accessible to EU users, such as Elon Musk’s interview with Donald Trump in August 2024. The DSA also requires
rapid content removal and potential platform bans.

Lawmakers in the United States
and in other countries may introduce new regulatory regimes that increase potential liability for content available on our platform. There
are a number of new laws and legislative proposals in the United States and globally aimed at limiting the scope of protections available
to online services and/or that further impose new obligations affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement, illegal
or harmful content, distributing targeted and other advertisements to teens, and other forms of unlawful content and/or online harm. These
legislative and/or regulatory requirements may increase our costs of operations, our liability for content posted by users on our platform,
our litigation costs, and/or may expose us to regulatory sanctions such as fines or penalties. If these or other additional statutory
or regulatory changes reduce liability protections for content published on our platform, we may be required to make significant changes
to our business model, including increasing our content moderation operations and building in additional product features or tools that
may not be favorable to our business. Any such changes to our business model may lead to new or heightened payment obligations or compliance
costs. Several U.S. states have also enacted legislation that regulates online content. Our business, financial performance and results
of operations could be negatively affected by the impact of these laws and the costs of complying with these laws, which are currently
the subject of various legal challenges.

In addition, there are pending
cases before the judiciary that may result in changes to the protections afforded to internet platforms that, depending on the outcomes,
could greatly limit the scope of the current protections. If these proposed or similar laws are passed or upheld, if similar future legislation
or governmental action is proposed or taken, and if existing protections are limited or removed, changes will be required that could impose
additional costs of operation, subject us to additional liability or cause users to abandon our service, any of which could adversely
affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

We could also face fines,
orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies, or other government-imposed sanctions as a result of content hosted
on our services. For example, laws and regulations in Germany and India provide for the imposition of fines for failure to comply with
certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and disclosure obligations. Numerous countries in Europe, the Middle East, Asia-Pacific,
and Latin America are considering, or have implemented, legislation imposing penalties, including fines, service throttling, access blocking,
or advertising bans, for failure to remove certain types of content or to follow certain processes. Such content-related legislation also
has required us in the past, and may require us in the future, to change our products or business practices. Our responses to content-related
legislation may increase our costs or may otherwise adversely impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain jurisdictions.
Regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent for various practices
could require product changes in the user interface that could adversely affect user growth and engagement.

We are involved in litigation that is unpredictable
and may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We are, and from time to time
may become, involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business activities, such as copyright infringement
and tort claims arising from user-uploaded content, patent and trademark infringement claims, breach of contract claims, putative class
actions based upon consumer protection or privacy laws and other matters. We cannot predict the outcome of any lawsuit, claim, investigation
or proceeding with certainty, or whether any such matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity,
or results of operations. We refer to the disclosure in “
