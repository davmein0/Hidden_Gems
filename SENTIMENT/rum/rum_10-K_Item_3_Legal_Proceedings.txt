Item 3. Legal Proceedings

We are, and from time to time
may become, involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of our business activities, such as copyright infringement
and tort claims arising from user-uploaded content, patent infringement claims, breach of contract claims, government demands, putative
class actions based upon consumer protection or privacy laws and other matters. The amounts that may be recovered in such matters may
be subject to insurance coverage.

In January 2021, we filed
an antitrust lawsuit against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google unlawfully
gives an advantage to its YouTube platform over Rumble in search engine results and in the mobile phone market. In June 2021, Google filed
a partial motion to dismiss the lawsuit and a motion to strike; in July 2022, the court denied Google’s motion. Discovery has concluded,
and the court heard argument on Google’s motion for summary judgment in February 2025. Trial was scheduled for May 2025, but has
been moved to July 7, 2025.

In addition, in May 2024,
we filed a second antitrust lawsuit against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California related to Google’s
monopolization of the online advertising market. This lawsuit is separate and distinct from the self-preferencing lawsuit filed in January
2021. In August 2024, we filed an amended complaint, and in September 2024, Google filed a motion to dismiss. In December 2024, the U.S.
Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) transferred the case to the existing proceeding, 
In re: Google Digital Advertising
Antitrust Litigation
 (JPML No. 3010). After common questions of facts are resolved in the Multidistrict Litigation proceeding, its
case would be transferred back to the Northern District of California for trial. A second amended compliant will be filed during the week
of March 24, 2025.

In January 2022, we received
notification of a lawsuit filed by Kosmayer Investment Inc. (“KII”) against Rumble and Mr. Pavlovski in the Ontario Superior
Court of Justice, alleging fraudulent misrepresentation in connection with KII’s decision to redeem its shares of Rumble in August
2020. KII is seeking rescission of such redemption such that, following such rescission, KII would own 20% of the issued and outstanding
shares of Rumble or, in the alternative, damages for the lost value of the redeemed shares, which KII has alleged to be worth $419.0 million
(based on the value ascribed to the shares of Rumble in the Business Combination), together with other damages including punitive damages
and costs. The case is currently in discovery. Although we believe that the allegations are meritless and intend to vigorously defend
against them, the result or impact of such claims is uncertain, and could result in, among other things, damages, and/or awards of attorneys’
fees or expenses. Mediation is scheduled for April 14, 2025.

Along with co-plaintiff Eugene
Volokh, in December 2022, we filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to block the enforcement
of New York State’s Social Media Law. In February 2023, the court granted our motion for a preliminary injunction, halting enforcement
of the law. The New York Attorney General appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; that appeal remains
pending.

In November 2023, we filed
a defamation lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida against Nandini Jammi and Claire Atkin, co-founders
of an organization that targets news outlets and platforms that do not adhere to their political worldview. The lawsuit seeks actual,
presumed, and punitive damages against Jammi and Atkin for their defamatory statements about Rumble, in addition to all costs and fees
associated with the case. We have also asked the court to prohibit the defendants from repeating their false statements. In May 2024,
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. The court held a hearing on that motion on November 7, 2024. Both
parties filed motions for summary judgment. The defendants filed a notice to withdraw their consent to a joint motion to extend the case
deadlines by six months and also withdrew their motion to dismiss. Rumble subsequently filed a motion to deny defendants’ motion
for summary judgment.

In August 2024, we filed an
antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas against the World Federation of Advertisers, WPP plc,
and GroupM Worldwide LLC alleging a conspiracy to withhold advertising revenue from Rumble and other digital media platforms. The lawsuit
seeks a declaration that the defendants’ conduct is illegal, a permanent injunction against the conduct, damages, interest, and
legal fees, among other relief. In September 2024, we filed an amended complaint, which added Diageo plc as a defendant. The defendants’
filed a motion to dismiss on February 21, 2025. Rumble’s answer is due on April 15, 2025.

In October 2024, plaintiff
David Stebbins filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware naming Rumble Inc. and an unaffiliated entity doing
business as “The Specter Report” as defendants. Mr. Stebbins, who is not represented by counsel, alleges six counts of copyright
infringement and one count of slander and seeks injunctive relief and $900,000 in damages from Rumble. We have not yet been formally served
with the lawsuit and believe that the allegations are meritless.

In November 2024, we filed
a lawsuit against the California Attorney General and Secretary of State in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California
to enjoin the enforcement of AB 2655, a recently enacted state law regulating online platforms. The law would require online platforms
to receive reports about posts related to elections, public officials, and candidates for office that are deemed “materially deceptive,”
then remove or label the content. Our lawsuit was consolidated with similar lawsuits filed by other affected online platforms and content
creators, and the state of California has agreed to enjoin the enforcement of the law during the initial phases of the litigation. The
plaintiffs’ summary judgment motions were filed on March 7, 2025.

In February 2025, Rumble filed
a complaint and a request for a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”) in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of
Florida against Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes related to content blocking orders issued by him against Rumble. The
court denied, without prejudice, Rumble’s motion for a TRO on the grounds that the matter was not ripe for judicial review. The
court noted that Justice Moraes’s pronouncements and directives had not been properly served on Rumble, that Rumble was not obligated
to comply with such pronouncements and directives, and that no U.S. entity was required to enforce them.

Stock Performance Graph

The following information
in this Item 5 is not deemed to be “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC or subject to Regulation
14A or 14C under the Exchange Act or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, and will not be deemed to be incorporated by
reference into any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except to the extent the Company specifically incorporates it
by reference into such a filing.

The SEC requires the Company
to include a line graph presentation comparing cumulative five-year common stock returns, or in the case of Rumble, the date of the consummation
of the Business Combination, with a broad-based stock index and either a nationally recognized industry index or an index of peer companies
selected by the Company. The Company has chosen to use the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Index as the broad-based
index. The S&P 500 Index was chosen as the Company does not believe any other published industry or line-of-business index adequately
represents the current operations of the Company. The graph assumes a beginning investment of $100 on September 16, 2022, the date of
the consummation of the Business Combination, and that all dividends are reinvested. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on
our common stock nor do we anticipate paying any such cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Overview

We are a high growth, video
sharing and cloud services provider platform designed to help content creators manage, distribute, and monetize their content by connecting
them with brands, publishers, and directly to their subscribers and followers. Our registered office is 444 Gulf of Mexico Drive, Longboat
Key, Florida, 34228. Our shares of Class A common stock and warrants are traded on The Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) under

Significant Events and Transactions 

On December 20, 2024, the
Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement for a strategic investment of $775 million from Tether, the largest
company in the digital assets industry and the most widely used dollar stablecoin across the world with more than 400 million users. As
part of the transaction, which closed on February 7, 2025, Tether purchased 103,333,333 shares of Class A Common Stock at a price per
share of $7.50, totaling $775 million in gross proceeds to Rumble. As part of the closing of the transaction, the Company completed a
tender offer to purchase 70,000,000 shares of its Class A Common Stock at a price of $7.50 per share (the “Tender Offer”),
for a total of $525 million, excluding fees and expenses related to the Tender Offer. The Company will use $250 million of the proceeds,
less transaction expenses, to support growth initiatives.

Refer to Note 11, Derivative
Liability, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

Revenues

We generate revenues primarily
from Audience Monetization and Other Initiatives.

Audience Monetization includes
advertising fees on the Rumble platform; subscription fees earned primarily from consumer product offerings such as Rumble Premium; Locals
and badges; revenues generated from content that is licensed by third-parties; pay-per-view; and fees from tipping and platform hosting
fees. Advertising fees are generated by delivering digital video and display advertisements as well as cost-per-message-read advertisements.
Digital video and display advertisements are placed on Rumble websites or mobile applications. Customers pay for advertisements either
directly or through relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of
actions, such as clicks, or purchases taken, by our users.

Other Initiatives includes
digital advertisements that are placed on Rumble’s network of third-party publisher websites or mobile applications; and cloud.
Cloud includes consumption-based fees, subscriptions for infrastructure and professional services.

Refer to Note 2, Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements.

Expenses

Expenses primarily include
cost of services, general and administrative, research and development, sales and marketing, acquisition-related transaction costs, amortization
and depreciation, and changes in fair value of contingent consideration. The most significant component of our expenses on an ongoing
basis are programming and content.

We expect to continue to invest
substantial resources to support our growth and anticipate that each of the following categories of expenses will increase in absolute
dollar amounts for the foreseeable future.

Cost of Services (Exclusive of Amortization
and Depreciation)

Cost of services consists
of costs related to obtaining, supporting and hosting the Company’s product offerings. These costs primarily include:

●
Programming and content costs related to compensation to content providers, including share-based compensation,
from whom video and other content are licensed. These costs are paid to these providers based on revenues generated, or in fixed amounts.
In certain circumstances, we incur additional costs related to incentivizing top content creators to promote and join our platform; and

●
Other cost of services such as third-party service provider costs, including data center and networking,
as well as payment processing fees and costs paid to publishers.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative
expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses, which include bonuses and share-based compensation for our executives and
certain other employees. General and administrative expenses also include legal and professional fees, business insurance costs, operating
lease costs and other costs. As a public company, we expect to continue to incur material costs related to compliance with applicable
laws and regulations, including audit and accounting fees, legal, insurance, investor relations and other costs.

41

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses
consist primarily of payroll and related expenses, which include bonuses and share-based compensation for our employees on our engineering
and development teams. Research and development expenses also include consultant fees related to our development activities to originate,
develop and enhance our platforms.

Sales and Marketing Expenses

Sales and marketing expenses
consist primarily of payroll and related expenses, which include bonuses and share-based compensation for our employees associated with
our sales and marketing functions. Sales and marketing expenses also include consultant fees and direct marketing costs related to the
promotion of our platforms and solutions. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase over time as we promote our platform
and brand, increase marketing activities, and grow domestic and international operations.

Acquisition-Related Transaction Costs 

Acquisition-related transaction
costs consist of transaction expenses related to acquisitions.

Amortization and Depreciation

Amortization and depreciation
represent the recognition of costs of assets used in operations, including property and equipment and intangible assets, over their estimated
service lives.

Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration

Certain contingent consideration
associated with the Callin acquisition does not meet the criteria for equity classification, and must be recorded as a liability in accordance
with guidance contained in ASC 815-40, 
Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity
 (“ASC 815-40”).
Because the contingent consideration meets the definition of a liability under ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging 
(“ASC 815”),
it is measured at fair value at inception and at each reporting date in accordance with the guidance in ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurement

(“ASC 820”), with any subsequent changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the applicable
period of change.

Non-Operating Income and Other Items

Interest Income 

Interest income consists of
interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities We invest in highly liquid securities such as money market funds,
treasury bills and term deposits.

Other Expense

Other expense consists of
miscellaneous income earned outside of normal company revenue as well as foreign exchange gains and losses related to gains and losses
on transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability 

We account for our outstanding
warrants in accordance with ASC 815-40, under which the warrants issued in connection with Business Combination do not meet the criteria
for equity classification, and must be recorded as liabilities. As these warrants meet the definition of a liability under ASC 815, they
are measured at fair value at inception and at each reporting date in accordance with the guidance in ASC 820, with any subsequent changes
in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the applicable period of change.

42

Change in Fair Value of Derivative 

The forward purchase contracts
in connection with the Tether transaction do not meet the criteria for equity classification, and must be recorded as a liability in accordance
with guidance contained in ASC 815-40, 
Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity
 (“ASC 815-40”).
Because the derivative meets the definition of a liability under ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging 
(“ASC 815”), it is
measured at fair value at inception and at each reporting date in accordance with the guidance in ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurement 
(“ASC
820”), with any subsequent changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in the applicable period
of change.

Income Tax Benefit (Expense)

Income tax benefit (expense)
consists of the estimated federal, state, and foreign income taxes incurred in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate.

Key Business Metrics

To analyze our business performance,
determine financial forecasts and help develop long-term strategic plans, we review the key business metrics described below.

Monthly Active Users (“MAUs”)

We
use MAUs as a measure of audience engagement to help us understand the volume of users engaged with our content on a monthly basis. MAUs
represent the total web, mobile app, and connected TV users of Rumble for each month, which allows us to measure our total user base
calculated from data provided by Google, a third-party analytics provider. Google defines “active users” as the “[n]umber
of distinct users who visited your website or application.”
1

We have used the Google
analytics systems since we first began publicly reporting MAU statistics, and the resulting data have not been independently verified.

As
of July 1, 2023, Universal Analytics (“UA”), Google’s analytics platform on which we historically relied for calculating
MAUs using company-set parameters, was phased out by Google and ceased processing data. At that time, Google Analytics 4 (“GA4”)
succeeded UA as Google’s next-generation analytics platform, which has been used to determine MAUs since the third quarter of 2023
and which we expect to continue to use to determine MAUs in future periods. Although Google has disclosed certain information regarding
the transition to GA4,
2

Google does not currently make available sufficient information
relating to its new GA4 algorithm for us to determine the full effect of the switch from UA to GA4 on our reported MAUs. Because Google
has publicly stated that metrics in UA “may be more or less similar” to metrics in GA4, and that “[i]t is not unusual
for there to be apparent discrepancies” between the two systems,
3

we are unable
to determine whether the transition from UA to GA4 has had a positive or negative effect, or the magnitude of such effect, if any, on
our reported MAUs. It is therefore possible that MAUs that we reported based on the UA methodology (“MAUs (UA)”) for periods
prior to July 1, 2023, cannot be meaningfully compared to MAUs based on the GA4 methodology (“MAUs (GA4)”) in subsequent
periods.

MAUs
(GA4) represent the total web, mobile app, and connected TV users of Rumble for each month,
4

which
allows us to measure our total user base calculated from data provided by Google.
5

Connected
TV users were not counted within MAUs within MAUs (UA) for periods prior to July 1, 2023, and we believe the number of such users was
immaterial in those prior periods. We also believe that fewer than 1 million MAUs in the current period are from connected TV, making
them similarly immaterial. Google’s parameters for measuring “active users” appear to exclude many, but not all, users
who access content on Rumble through “embedded” videos on domains other than rumble.com, and we are unable to determine the
exact number of users who access “embedded” content within our total number of MAUs. In addition, MAUs (GA4) may rely on
statistical sampling and may be based on estimates of data that Google is missing “due to factors such as cookie consent.”

 During the measurement period, Rumble was available on

 Google provides additional information on its definition
of an “active user,” 
see 
Google, Comparing Metrics.

According to the GA4 dashboard, “[a]s of August 26, 2023, Analytics is estimating data that’s missing due to factors such as cookie consent.”

43

As with our earlier MAU reporting,
there is a potential for minor overlap in the resulting data due to users who access Rumble’s content through the web, our mobile
apps, and connected TVs in a given measurement period; however, given that we believe this minor overlap to be immaterial, we do not separately
track or report “unique users” as distinct from MAUs. Our reported MAUs have not historically included users of Locals, however,
starting in mid-May 2024, Locals users began using Rumble’s single sign-on technology to access their account, which we expect will
reduce the number of Locals users not included in our Rumble MAU reporting. We also do not separately report the number of users who register
for accounts in any given period, which is different from MAUs.

Like many other major online
platforms, we rely on significant paid advertising in order to attract users to our platform; however, we cannot be certain that all or
substantially all activity that results from such advertising is genuine. Spam activity, including inauthentic and fraudulent user activity,
if undetected, may contribute to some amount of overstatement of our performance indicators, including reporting of MAUs by Google. We
continually seek to improve our ability to estimate the total number of spam-generated users, and we eliminate material activity that
is substantially likely to be spam from the calculation of our MAUs. We will not, however, succeed in identifying and removing all spam.

MAUs (GA4) were 68 million
on average in the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of 1% from the third quarter of 2024. The increase in MAUs was primarily driven
by increased interest in politics during the final stretch of the U.S. presidential election campaign, offset in part by reduced MAU
activity during the December holiday season.

Average Revenue Per User (“ARPU”)

We use ARPU as a measure of
our ability to monetize our user base. Quarterly ARPU is calculated as quarterly Audience Monetization revenue divided by MAUs for the
relevant quarter (as reported by Google Analytics). ARPU does not include Other Initiatives revenue.

44

ARPU
was $0.39 in the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of 18% from the third quarter of 2024. The increase from the third quarter is attributable
to higher advertising revenue and subscription revenue.

We
regularly review, have adjusted in the past, and may in the future adjust our processes for calculating our key business metrics to improve
their accuracy, including through the application of new data or technologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously
undetected spam activity. As a result of such adjustments, our key business metrics may not be comparable period-over-period.

Revenues

Revenues
increased by $14.5 million to $95.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023, of which
$10.3 million was attributable to an increase in Audience Monetization revenues and $4.2 million was attributable to higher Other Initiatives.
The increase in Audience Monetization revenues was mainly due to higher revenue from subscriptions, tipping fees, licensing, platform
hosting and advertising. The increase in Other Initiative revenue was mostly due to more advertising inventory being monetized by our
publisher network and an increase in cloud services offered.

Cost
of Services

Cost
of services decreased by $7.7 million to $138.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in programming and content costs of $9.5 million, offset by an increase of $1.8 million
in other cost of services including payment processing fees and costs paid to publishers.

General
and Administrative Expenses

General
and administrative expenses decreased by $0.5 million to $36.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended
December 31, 2023. The decrease was mainly driven by a reduction in administrative expenses of $2.8 million and share-based compensation
of $1.1 million, offset by an increase in payroll and related expenses of $3.4 million. The decrease of $2.8 million in administrative
expenses was primarily due to lower expenses related to public company-related costs, legal, insurance, and other administrative services.
The decrease in share-based compensation was related to the recognition of contingent shares issued in connection with the Callin acquisition
that was accounted for as a post-combination expense as well as the expense of previously and newly granted restricted stock units and
stock options for certain employees and executives.

Research
and Development Expenses

Research
and development expenses increased by $3.2 million to $18.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December
31, 2023. The increase was due to an increase of $2.7 million in payroll and related expenses, and an increase of $0.5 million in other
expenses .

Sales
and Marketing Expenses

Sales
and marketing expenses increased by $3.9 million to $17.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December
31, 2023. The increase was due to an increase of $2.7 million in payroll and related expenses, $0.4 million in consulting services, and
$0.8 million in other marketing and public relations activities.

Acquisition-Related
Transaction Costs 

Acquisition-related
transaction costs decreased by $1.2 million to $nil in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.
Acquisition-related transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2023 consisted of transaction costs incurred related to acquisitions
completed in 2023.

Amortization
and Depreciation

Amortization
and depreciation increased by $8.8 million to $13.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31,
2023. The increase was due to an increase of $2.0 million from depreciation on our property and equipment as we continue to build out
our infrastructure, as well as an increase in amortization from intangible assets of $6.8 million.

46

Change
in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration

Change
in fair value of contingent consideration increased by $3.3 million to $1.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the
year ended December 31, 2023. The contingent consideration liability arose in connection with the Callin acquisition and the fair value
of this contingent consideration was measured using the fair value of the expected number of shares to be issued and the Company’s
share price at closing. The change in fair value of contingent consideration was directly attributable to changes in the Company’s
share price since the closing and the probability of contingencies being met.

income decreased by $5.5 million to $8.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The
decrease was due to our reduced investment in money market funds, treasury bills, and term deposits.

Other
Expense

Other expense increased by an immaterial amount in the year ended December
31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to lower foreign currency rate fluctuation as we
maintained the majority of our cash balance in U.S. dollars, which is our functional currency, as of December 31, 2024.

Change
in Fair Value of Warrant Liability

Change
in fair value of warrant liability decreased by $35.1 million resulting in a loss of $32.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2024.
The warrant liability arose in connection with the warrants offered as part of the Business Combination. As these warrants meet the classification
of a financial liability in accordance with ASC 815-40, the related warrant liability is measured at its fair value, determined in accordance
with ASC 820, at each reporting period. The fair value of this warrant liability was measured using the fair value of the Company’s
warrants listed on the Nasdaq. The decrease in the change in fair value of warrant liability was directly attributable to changes in
the trading price of Rumble’s warrants.

Change
in Fair Value of Derivative

Change in fair value of derivative
decreased by $184.7 million resulting in a loss of $184.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2024. The derivative arose in connection
with the forward purchase contracts related to the Tether transaction. As the forward purchase contracts meet the classification of a
financial liability in accordance with ASC 815-40, the related derivative is measured at its fair value, determined in accordance with
ASC 820, at each reporting period. The fair value of this forward purchase contracts were measured using a Monte Carlo simulation methodology
that includes simulating the stock price using a risk-neutral Geometric Brownian Motion-based pricing model. The decrease relates to the
revaluation of the forward purchase contracts in connection with the Tether transaction.

Income
Tax Benefit 

Income
tax benefit decreased by $1.3 million to $2.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Our
principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operating activities and funds previously raised. The primary short-term requirements
for liquidity and capital are to fund general working capital and capital expenditures.

47

As
of December 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $114.0 million. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit
with banks and amounts held in money market funds, treasury bills, and term deposits.

As
we have consistently stated, we are using a substantial portion of funds to acquire content by providing economic incentives to a small
number of content creators, including sports leagues. As of December 31, 2024, we had entered into programming and content agreements
with a minimum contractual cash commitment of $30 million. A significant amount of these minimum contractual cash commitments will be
paid over 12 to 24 months, commencing in 2025.

The
following table presents a summary of the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:

Operating
Activities 

Net cash used in operating
activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily consisted of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, including a $218.7
million loss on the change in fair value of warrants, contingent consideration and derivative, $21.5 million change in share-based compensation,
$13.6 million change in amortization and depreciation, $1.0 million changes in non-cash lease expenses, as well as changes in operating
assets and liabilities. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the
year ended December 31, 2023 was mostly due to changes in net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items, offset by changes in operating
assets and liabilities.

Investing
Activities

Net cash used in investing
activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 consisted of $7.2 million in purchases of property, equipment, and intangible assets,
$9.6 million in cash paid in connection with the acquisitions of Callin and North River, and $1.1 million in the sale of marketable securities.
The decrease in net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31,
2023 was mainly driven by decreases in purchases of property and equipment and marketable securities, which were partially offset by
a rise in spending on intangible assets. Additionally, the reduction in net cash used was due to cash payments made to non-accredited
investors related to the Callin acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2024 as well as cash acquired in connection with the Callin
acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2023.

Financing
Activities

Net
cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 consisted of $2.0 million in taxes paid from the net share settlement
of share-based compensation and $0.4 million in share issuance costs, offset by $0.7 million from proceeds related to stock options exercised.
The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was due to a decrease in taxes paid from the net share settlement of share-based
compensation as well as an increase in proceeds from stock options exercised in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to net cash
used in the year ended December 31, 2023. The reduction in net cash used was offset by an increase in share issuance costs.

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures

To
supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial
measures, as described below, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures, which may
be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, are presented to enhance investors’ overall understanding
of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented
in accordance with GAAP. We use the non-GAAP financial measure of: Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as net income (loss) excluding interest
income (expense), net, other income (expense), net; provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation
expense, acquisition-related expense, change in fair value of warrants, change in fair value of contingent consideration, and change
in the fair value of derivative. The Company’s management believes that it is important to consider Adjusted EBITDA, in addition
to net income (loss), as it helps identify trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the gains and losses
that are included in net income (loss) but excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.

Adjusted
EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. There
are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA rather than net income (loss), the nearest GAAP equivalent. As a result
of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net income (loss)
and our other financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss),
the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA:

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates

We
prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (“US GAAP”). The preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates
on a continuous basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there
are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows will be affected.

We
believe the following key accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements. Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we consider the most important to the portrayal of our
financial condition and results of operations because they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result
of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Accordingly, we believe that these are the
most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.

For
further information on the summary of significant accounting policies and the effect on our consolidated financial statements, see Note
2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements.

Acquisitions
(Business Combination vs Asset Acquisition)

The
Company evaluates whether acquired net assets should be accounted for as a business combination or an asset acquisition by first applying
a screen test to determine whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable
asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If so, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If not, the Company applies
its judgment to determine whether the acquired net assets meet the definition of a business by considering if the set includes an acquired
input, process, and the ability to create outputs.

50

Valuation
of Intangible Assets 

The
Company acquired intangible assets in connection with the acquisitions of Callin and North River. A valuation was performed to determine
the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets related to the acquisition. Judgment is required to estimate the fair value
of these identifiable intangible assets. We may use quoted market prices, prices for similar assets, present value techniques, and other
valuation techniques such as the depreciated replacement cost and relief from royalty methods to prepare these estimates. We may need
to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to implement these valuation techniques.
Due to the degree of judgment involved in our estimation techniques, our estimate may result in a significant difference in the estimation
of fair value.

Share-based
Compensation

The
Company issues equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units to certain of its employees, directors, officers and consultants.
We account for equity awards by recognizing the fair value of share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service
period of the award.

For
equity awards with a service condition, the fair value is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model which
takes into account the following inputs: stock price, expected term, volatility, and risk-free interest rate.

For
equity awards with a market condition, the fair value is estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation methodology that
includes simulating the stock price using a risk-neutral Geometric Brownian Motion-based pricing model. Changes in the estimated inputs
or using other option valuation methods may result in materially different option values and share-based compensation expense.

For
equity awards with a performance condition, the Company assesses the likelihood of the performance condition underlying an award being
met and recognizes a share-based compensation expense associated with that award only if it is probable the performance condition will
be met. Where the performance condition underlying an award is a change in control, the Company considers the performance condition to
be probable only when it occurs.

Income
Taxes

The
Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining
our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting
principles and complex tax laws.

Uncertain
tax positions are accounted for using a comprehensive model for the manner in which a company should recognize, measure, present and
disclose in its financial statements all material uncertain income tax positions. The Company reviews its nexus in various tax jurisdictions
and the Company’s tax positions related to all open tax years for events that could change the status of its tax liability, if
any, or require an additional liability to be recorded. Such events may be the resolution of issues raised by a taxing authority, expiration
of the statute of limitations for a prior open tax year or new transactions for which a tax position may be deemed to be uncertain. Those
positions, for which management’s assessment is that there is more than a 50 percent probability of sustaining the position
upon challenge by a taxing authority based upon its technical merits, are subjected to the measurement criteria.

Trade
and Barter Transactions

The
Company engages in trade and barter transactions whereby the Company and its counterparty exchange media campaigns or other promotional
services. The Company reviews each transaction to ensure the advertising it receives has economic substance and records revenue in an
amount equal to the fair value of the products and services received unless this is not reasonable to estimate, in which case the consideration
is measured based on the standalone selling price of the advertising inventory promised or delivered to the customer. Trade and barter
revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is fulfilled and follows the same pattern of recognition as the Company’s
normal advertising revenue. Trade and barter expense is recorded when goods or services are consumed. The trade and barter expense is
recorded in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statement of operations.

51

Arrangement
to Sell Shares to Tether (Unit of Account)

The Company applied judgement in determining whether the support agreements
and agreement to sell shares to Tether were a single unit or multiple units of account. Given that the agreements were entered into contemporaneously
and in contemplation of one another, the closing of the support agreements was contingent on the close of the sale of shares to Tether,
and the agreements relate to the same underlying risk (the price risk of the Company’s shares), the Company determined that the
overall arrangement was one unit of account. As a result, the arrangement is accounted for as a derivative, initially and subsequently
measured at fair value with changes through net loss. See Note 17 for information regarding the estimation of the fair value of the derivative.

New
Accounting Pronouncements

See
Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2024
and 2023.

JOBS
Act Accounting Election

We
are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised
accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We intend to elect to adopt new or revised accounting
standards under private company adoption timelines. Accordingly, the timing of our adoption of new or revised accounting standards will
not be the same as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies or that have opted out of using such extended transition
period and our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or
revised accounting standards.

Item
7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We
are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations.

Credit
Risk

We
are exposed to credit risk on our cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. We place cash, cash equivalents,
and marketable securities with financial institutions with high credit standing, and we place excess cash in marketable investment grade
debt securities. We are exposed to credit risk on our accounts receivable in the event of default by a customer. We bill our customers
under customary payment terms and review customers for their creditworthiness. The term between invoicing and payment due date is not
significant. A meaningful portion of our revenue is attributable to service agreements with one customer. For the years ended December
31, 2024 and 2023, one customer accounted for $14.9 million and $37.0 million or 16% and 46% of our revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, no single customer represented 10% or more
of total accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2023, one customer accounted for 35% of accounts receivable.

Interest
Rate Risk

We
are exposed to interest rate risk on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities of $114.0 million, consisting of investments in money market funds, treasury bills, and term
deposits for which the fair market value would be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. However, due to the short-term
maturities and the low-risk profile of our investments, an immediate 10% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on
the fair market value of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.

Report
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of

Rumble Inc.

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rumble Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and
2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ (deficit) equity, and cash flows for the years then ended,
and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of December 31,
2024 and 2023, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Basis for Opinion

These
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company
in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part
of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our
audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence
regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Overview
                                            and Basis of Presentation

Nature
of Operations 

Rumble
Inc. ("Rumble” or the "Company”) is a high growth, video sharing platform and cloud services provider designed
to help content creators manage, distribute, and monetize their content by connecting them with brands, publishers, and directly to their
subscribers and followers. The Company’s registered office is located at 444 Gulf of Mexico Drive, Longboat Key, Florida, 34228.
The Company’s shares of Class A common stock and warrants are traded on The Nasdaq Global Market ("Nasdaq”) under the
symbol "RUM” and "RUMBW”, respectively.

Basis
of Presentation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements (the “financial statements”) are prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the results of the Company and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to the authoritative guidance found in the Accounting
Standards Codification (“ASC”) and Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”). All intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated upon consolidation. These financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, which is the functional currency of
the Company.

Basis
of Consolidation 

These
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities in which the Company
has a controlling voting interest or is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from
the date control is transferred to the Company and are de-consolidated from the date control ceases. The consolidated financial statements
include all the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the Company and its subsidiaries after eliminating intercompany
balances and transactions.

Use
of Estimates

The
preparation of these financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates, judgments, and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as of
the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing
basis, the Company evaluates the estimates used, which include but are not limited to the: allowance for credit losses; valuation of
share-based compensation awards; estimates in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection
with acquisitions; fair value of financial instruments including warrant liability, contingent consideration, and derivative; discount
rate in determining lease liabilities; valuation of long-lived assets and their associated useful lives, valuation of goodwill; and the
realization of tax assets, estimates of tax liabilities, and valuation of deferred taxes; and estimates in the determination of the fair
value of non-cash consideration earned in trade and barter transactions. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions are reviewed periodically
and the impact of any revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which such revisions are made. Actual results
could differ materially from those estimates, judgments, or assumptions, and such differences could be material to the Company’s
consolidated financial position and results of operations.

Summary
of Significant Accounting Policies

Foreign
Currency 

The
functional currencies of the Company and its foreign subsidiaries are the U.S. dollar. Transactions denominated in currencies other than
the U.S. dollar are remeasured using end-of-period exchange rates or exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction, and the
resulting gains or losses are recognized as a component of other income (expense).

Fair
Value Measurements

The
fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between market
participants. Fair value measurement is based on a hierarchy of observable or unobservable inputs. The standard describes three levels
of inputs that may be used to measure fair value.

Level
                              1 -
Inputs
                                            to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical
                                            investments as of the reporting date;

Level
                              2 -
Inputs
                                            to the valuation methodology other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either
                                            directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date, and the fair value can be determined
                                            through the use of models or other valuation methodologies; and

Level
                              3 -
Inputs
                                            to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs in situations where there is little
                                            or no market activity of the asset and liability and the reporting entity makes estimates
                                            and assumptions relating to the pricing of the asset or liability, including assumptions
                                            regarding risk. This includes certain cash flow pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies
                                            and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.

In
instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy,
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to
the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

The
Company may measure eligible assets and liabilities at fair value, with changes in value recognized in profit and loss. Fair value treatment
may be elected either upon initial recognition of an eligible asset or liability or, for an existing asset or liability, if an event
triggers a new basis of accounting.

The
Company evaluates the estimated fair value of financial instruments using available market information and management’s estimates.
The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value amounts.
Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, lease liabilities, warrant liability, contingent consideration, derivative liability, and other liabilities, approximate
fair value.

Concentration
Risk

A
meaningful portion of the Company’s revenue (and a substantial portion of the Company’s net cash from operations that it
can freely access) is attributable to service agreements with several customers. See Note 18 for further details.

Summary
                                            of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Revenue
Recognition

The
Company derives revenues primarily from:

●
Audience
                                            Monetization; and

●
Other
                                            Initiatives

Revenues
are recognized when the control of promised services is transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company
expects to be entitled to in exchange for those services. Sales tax and other similar taxes are excluded from revenues.

In
order to recognize revenue, the Company applies the following five (5) steps:

1.
Identify
                                            the contract with a customer

2.
Identify
                                            the performance obligation(s)

3.
Determine
                                            the transaction price

4.
Allocate
                                            the transaction price to the performance obligation(s)

5.
Recognize
                                            revenue when/as performance obligation(s) are satisfied

Audience
Monetization

Audience Monetization includes advertising fees on the Rumble platform;
subscription fees earned primarily from consumer product offerings such as Rumble Premium, Locals and badges; revenues generated from
content that is licensed by third-parties; pay-per-view; and fees from tipping and platform hosting fees.

The
Company generates advertising fees by delivering digital video and display advertisements as well as cost-per-message-read advertisements.
Digital video and display advertisements are placed on Rumble websites and its associated mobile or connected TV applications. Customers
pay for advertisements either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of
impressions delivered or the number of actions such as clicks or purchases taken, by our users. For cost-per-message-read advertising,
customers pay to have their products or services promoted by a content creator.

The
Company recognizes revenue from video and display advertisements when a user engages with the advertisement, such as an impression, click,
or purchase. For cost-per-message-read advertising, advertising revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is fulfilled, usually
when the message is read or when a user makes a purchase. In general, advertising fees are reported on a gross basis because the Company
controls the advertising inventory before it is transferred to the customer. Control is evidenced by the Company’s sole ability
to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to the customer.

Revenue
from subscription services related to consumer product offerings, including Rumble Premium, Locals, and badges, is recognized over the
contract duration on a straight-line basis.

Summary
                                            of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Revenue
Recognition (Continued)

Under
bulk license agreements, the Company’s obligations include hosting the content libraries for access and searching by the customer,
updating the libraries with new content provided by the content owner, and making videos selected by the customer available for download,
throughout the term of the contract. These services are billed based on the access to the content regardless of the number of videos
downloaded. All of these services are highly interdependent as the customer’s ability to derive its intended benefit from the contract
depends on the entity transferring both the access to the content library over time and making the videos available as and when required
by the customer for download. These services, therefore, constitute a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct
services transferred to the customer in a similar manner throughout the contract term. The predominant item in the single performance
obligation is a license providing a right to access the content library throughout the license period. For these arrangements, the Company
recognizes the total fixed fees under the contract as revenue ratably over the term of the contract as the performance obligation is
satisfied, as this best depicts the pattern of control transfer.

For
license agreements related to the Rumble Player, the Company’s obligations include providing access to the current version the
Rumble Player throughout the term of the contract. As part of this arrangement, the customer is required to use the most current version
of the player and therefore, the utility of the player to the customer is significantly affected by Rumble’s ongoing activities
to maintain and support the player. Revenue is therefore recognized ratably over the term of the contract.

The
Company generates revenue through the licensing of content to third-party platforms. The consideration received is variable in nature
as it is dependent on the level of traffic and number of impressions generated on the third-party platforms. For these arrangements,
revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied over the period the license is provided to the third-party provider.
The usage-based royalty exemption has been taken by the Company for these arrangements.

Fees
from tipping features are recognized at a point in time when a user tips on the platform.

Revenues
related to platform hosting are recognized over time as the Company provides access to the platform and varies based on the subscription
fees generated by the content creator. The Company allocates variable fees earned from these arrangements to those distinct performance
obligations where pricing practices are consistent with the allocation objective.

Other
Initiatives

Other
Initiatives includes digital advertisements that are placed on Rumble’s network of third-party publisher websites or mobile applications
and cloud. Cloud includes consumption-based fees, subscriptions for infrastructure and professional services.

The Company facilitates the placement
of the customer’s digital video and display advertisements on third-party publisher websites or mobile applications. Customers pay
for advertisements either directly or through relationships with advertising agencies or resellers, based on the number of impressions
delivered or the number of actions such as clicks or purchases taken, by our users. The Company recognizes revenue when a user engages
with the advertisement, such as an impression, click, or purchase.

Cloud
services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption
basis are recognized when the customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed at the amount for which we have
the right to invoice for services performed. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably
over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services.

Revenue
Recognition (Continued)

Principal
vs Agent

In
our arrangements, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on
a net basis).

The Company controls the advertising
inventory (including for digital advertisements that are placed with third-party publishers) before it is transferred to the customer
and therefore is the principal in the transaction. Control is evidenced by the Company’s ability to monetize the advertising inventory
before it is transferred to the customer.

The Company is also acting as the principal
in licensing and subscription transactions, as it has control over both the content that is monetized as well as the platform over which
the content is displayed. Further, the Company manages the monetization of content and is the only party to the contract with its customers.

As
it relates to revenues earned from platform hosting, we present revenue on a net basis as the Company is acting as the agent providing
a platform for content creators to post content and interact with end users.

Practical
Expedients and Exemptions

The
Company does not disclose the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected
length of one year or less and for contracts for which revenue is recognized at the amount to which the Company has the right to invoice
for services performed.

Trade
and Barter Transactions

The
Company engages in trade and barter transactions whereby the Company and its counterparty exchange media campaigns or other promotional
services. The Company reviews each transaction to ensure the advertising it receives has economic substance and records revenue in an
amount equal to the fair value of the products and services received unless this is not reasonable to estimate, in which case the consideration
is measured based on the standalone selling price of the advertising inventory promised or delivered to the customer. Trade and barter
revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is fulfilled and follows the same pattern of recognition as the Company’s
normal advertising revenue. Trade and barter expense is recorded when goods or services are consumed. Trade and barter revenue was $
2,881,398
 and
$
nil
 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Trade and barter expenses were $
3,000,000
 and $
nil
 for
the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The trade and barter expense is recorded in sales and marketing expense in
the consolidated statement of operations.

Deferred
Revenue

The
Company records amounts that have been invoiced to its clients in either deferred revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue
recognition criteria described above have been met. Deferred revenue includes payments received in advance of performance under the contract.

Costs
of Services (Exclusive of Amortization and Depreciation)

Costs
of services primarily consist of costs related to obtaining, supporting and hosting the Company’s product offerings. These costs
primarily include:

●
Programming
                                            and content costs related to payments to content providers from whom videos and other content
                                            are licensed. These costs are typically paid to these providers based on revenues generated.
                                            In certain circumstances we incur additional costs related to incentivizing top content creators
                                            to promote and join our platform. Where that is the case, the Company recognizes the associated
                                            cost on a straight-line basis over the contractual term to which it relates.

●
Other
                                            costs of services include third-party service provider costs such as data center and networking,
                                            staffing costs directly related to professional services fees, and costs paid to publishers.

Advertising
Expenses

Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred and are included in sales and marketing expense on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company
incurred advertising expenses of $
5,311,094
 and $
4,550,742
 during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Share-Based
Compensation

The
Company issues equity awards such as stock options and restricted stock units to certain of its employees, advisory board members, directors,
officers and consultants. For awards with a market condition, the market condition is taken into consideration in the fair value-based
measure, whereas service and performance conditions are taken into consideration in determining the share-based compensation expense.

For
equity awards granted to employees that have only a service condition, the Company recognizes the share-based compensation expense on
a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The vesting period for the equity awards granted is determined by the board
of directors of the company and the typical vesting period for equity awards with service conditions is three to four years. The requisite
service period for Rumble’s equity awards subject only to service conditions is coterminous with the vesting period specific to
those equity awards.

For
equity awards with either a market condition or a performance condition, the Company determines the fair value of each tranche of the
award, and then recognizes the share-based compensation expense associated with each tranche of the award over the requisite service
period for that tranche. For equity awards with a performance condition, the Company assesses the likelihood of the performance condition
underlying an award being met and recognizes a share-based compensation expense associated with that award only if it is probable that
the performance condition will be met.

Forfeitures
are accounted for when they occur.

Summary
                                            of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Income
Taxes

The
Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in
the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the difference
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts (“temporary differences”)
at enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is established
for deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain.

Uncertain
tax positions are accounted for using a comprehensive model for the manner in which a company should recognize, measure, present and
disclose in its financial statements all material uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return.
This applies to income taxes and is not intended to be applied by analogy to other taxes, such as sales taxes, value-add taxes, or property
taxes. The Company reviews its nexus in various tax jurisdictions and the Company’s tax positions related to all open tax years
for events that could change the status of its tax liability, if any, or require an additional liability to be recorded. Such events
may be the resolution of issues raised by a taxing authority, expiration of the statute of limitations for a prior open tax year or new
transactions for which a tax position may be deemed to be uncertain. Those positions, for which management’s assessment is that
there is more than a 50 percent probability of sustaining the position upon challenge by a taxing authority based upon its technical
merits, are subjected to the measurement criteria.

The
Company records the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement
with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Any liabilities for which the Company expects to make cash
payments within the next twelve months are classified as “short term”.

Loss
per Share

The
Company calculates basic and diluted net loss per common share by dividing the net loss by the number of weighted average common shares
outstanding during the period. The Company has excluded other potentially dilutive shares, which include warrants to purchase common
shares and outstanding stock options, from the number of common shares outstanding as their inclusion in the computation for all periods
would be anti-dilutive due to net losses incurred.

Cash,
Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities

Cash
and cash equivalents primarily consist of cash on deposit with banks and amounts held in treasury bills and money market funds. Cash
equivalents are carried at amortized cost, which approximates their fair market value.

The
Company considers all marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents
and those with original maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets. Management
determines the appropriate classification of investments at the time of purchase.

Marketable
securities are being accounted for as held-to-maturity investments and are carried at amortized cost with any gains and losses being
recognized in interest income on the consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2023, the marketable securities have maturity
dates of twelve months or less and their amortized cost approximates fair value.

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Current Expected Credit Losses

Accounts
receivable includes current outstanding invoices billed to customers due under customary trade terms. The term between invoicing and
when payment is due is not significant. The accounts receivable balance as of January 1, 2023 was $
4,748,189
.

The
Company maintains an allowance for current expected credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts
receivable and changes are classified in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations. Collectability
is assessed by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when
specific customers are identified with known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit
losses, the Company considers historical collectability based on past due status, customer-specific information, market conditions, and
reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data.

Volatility
in market conditions and evolving credit trends are difficult to predict and may cause variability and volatility that may have a material
impact on the allowance for credit losses in future periods. The allowance for credit losses was $
117,069
 and $
nil
 as of December 31,
2024 and 2023, respectively.

Property
and Equipment

Property
and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. 
Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, which is generally as follows:

Useful Lives

Computer hardware

3
-
5
 years

Furniture and fixtures

3
-
5
 years

Leasehold improvements

Lesser of useful life or term of lease

Expenditures
for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.

Right-of-Use
Assets and Lease Liabilities

Right-of-use
assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease
payments arising from the lease.

Most of our leases contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease
components include fixed payments for maintenance, utilities, and real estate taxes. The Company combines fixed lease and non-lease components
and account for them as a single lease component. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such as contingent rent escalations,
common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, or other costs. Such variable lease costs are expensed as incurred on the consolidated
statements of operations.

Right-of-use
assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at the commencement date based on the present value of
lease payments over the lease term.

Our
lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. When
determining the probability of exercising such options, we consider contract-based, asset-based, and market-based factors. We do not
assume renewals in our determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured.

Right-of-Use
Assets and Lease Liabilities (Continued)

As
most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, the incremental borrowing rate is used based on the information available at the
commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company determines the incremental borrowing rate as the interest
rate the Company would pay to borrow over a similar term the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use
asset in a similar economic environment.

Operating
lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.

The
Company has elected the practical expedient to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases, which are
those leases with a term of twelve months or less at the commencement date.

Intangible
Assets

Intangible
assets with finite lives consist of intellectual property, internal-use software, technology, brand, domain names, and an assembled workforce.
Intangible assets acquired through business combination are recorded at their respective estimated fair values upon acquisition close.
Other intangible assets acquired through asset acquisition are measured following a cost accumulation and allocation model under which
the cost of the acquisition is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the net assets acquired.

Intangible
assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 
two
 to 
fifteen
 years
.

Internal
Use Software and Website Development Costs

The
Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in developing software programs or websites to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud-based
applications used to deliver our services. The Company capitalizes these costs once the preliminary project stage is complete, and it
is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the intended function. Capitalized internal use
software costs are included in intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. The estimated useful life of costs capitalized
is evaluated for each specific project and is up to 
five years
. Amortization of internal software development costs is included in amortization
and depreciation expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.

Costs
related to the preliminary project stage, post-implementation, training and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets and Finite Lived Intangible Assets

The
Company reviews long-lived assets and finite lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In order to determine if assets have been impaired, assets are grouped and
tested at the lowest level for which identifiable independent cash flows are available (“Asset Group”). When indicators of
potential impairment are present, the Company prepares a projected undiscounted cash flow analysis for the respective asset or asset
group. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying value of the asset or Asset Group, an impairment loss is recognized
equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, if any. The Company did not identify any indicators of impairment during
the periods presented.

Summary

Goodwill

Goodwill
represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible
assets acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For its annual goodwill impairment test in all periods to date, the Company
has determined it has one reporting unit and the fair value of its reporting unit has been determined by the Company’s enterprise
value. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth fiscal quarter.

For
its annual impairment test performed on October 1, 2024, the Company completed an assessment and determined that there was no impairment
of goodwill.

Derivative
Liability

The Company evaluates financial instruments, including forward purchase
or sale contracts over its own equity (“forward purchase contracts”), to determine the appropriate classification as financial
liabilities, derivatives, or equity. Forward purchase contracts that meet the definition of mandatorily redeemable financial instruments
or that obligate the Company to repurchase its own shares at a fixed or determinable price are classified as liabilities.

Forward purchase contracts classified
as liabilities are initially recognized at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet, and subsequently remeasured at fair value each
reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in interest income (expense) on the consolidated statements of operations.

Forward purchase contracts that do not meet the criteria to be classified
as liabilities or equity are accounted for as derivatives. Derivatives are recognized initially and subsequently at fair value, with changes
recognized in changes in fair value of derivative on the consolidated statements of operations.

Warrant
Liability 

The Company accounts for warrants by
first assessing whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification, including whether the warrants are indexed
to the Company’s own shares of common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require “net cash settlement”
in a circumstance outside of the Company’s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires
the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of issuance of the warrants and as of each subsequent quarterly period end
date while the warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification,
such warrants are required to be as a liability initially at their fair value on the date of issuance, and subsequently remeasured to
fair value on each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of liability-classified warrants are recognized
on the consolidated statements of operations in the period of change.

The
Company accounts for all its warrants as a liability as the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity classification.

Business
Combinations

The
Company evaluates whether acquired net assets should be accounted for as a business combination or an asset acquisition by first applying
a screen test to determine whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable
asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If so, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If not, the Company applies
its judgement to determine whether the acquired net assets meets the definition of a business by considering if the set includes an acquired
input, process, and the ability to create outputs.

The
Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when it has obtained control. The Company measures goodwill as
the fair value of the consideration transferred including the fair value of any non-controlling interest recognized, less the net recognized
amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured at their fair value as of the acquisition date. Transaction
costs, other than those associated with the issuance of debt or equity securities, that the Company incurs in connection with a business
combination are expensed as incurred.

Any
contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration that does not meet all the criteria
for equity classification is initially recorded at its fair value at the acquisition date, and subsequently remeasured to fair value
on each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of liability-classified contingent consideration are recognized
in the consolidated statements of operations in the period of change.

When
the initial accounting for a business combination has not been finalized by the end of the reporting period in which the transaction
occurs, the Company reports provisional amounts. Provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period, which does not exceed
one year from the acquisition date. These adjustments, or recognition of additional assets or liabilities, reflect new information obtained
about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognized at that
date
.

Asset
Acquisitions

The
Company accounts for asset acquisitions by allocating the consideration to the acquired assets and liabilities on a relative fair value
basis. Working capital items are recognized at their stated amounts.

The
Company has elected an accounting policy to recognize any contingent consideration obligation in an asset acquisition when the contingency
is resolved, and the consideration becomes payable. The contingent consideration will be included in the cost allocated to the acquired
assets if and when the contingency is resolved.

Standards or Amendments Adopted

Accounting
Standards Update 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. The purpose of this ASU
is to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses.
In addition, the amendments enhance interim disclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment
measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and contain other
disclosure requirements.

The
new standard requires an enhanced disclosure of significant segment expenses on an annual and interim basis. Upon adoption, the guidance
was applied retroactively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. See Note 20 for further details.

New
Standards or Amendments Not Yet Effective

The
following amendments to existing standards have been issued up to and including the date of issuance of these financial statements, however
are not yet effective for the Company:

●

Accounting Standards Update 2023-08, 
Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets.
 The amendments in this update require in-scope crypto assets (including the Company's Bitcoin holdings) to be measured at fair value in the statement of financial position, with gains and losses from changes in the fair value of such crypto assets recognized in net income for each reporting period. The update also requires certain interim and annual disclosures for crypto assets within the scope of the standard. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.

●
Accounting
Standards Update 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. 
The amendments in this update require
that public business entities on an annual basis (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional
information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater
than 5 percent of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income or loss by the applicable statutory income tax rate). This ASU is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.

●
Accounting
Standards Update 2024-03, 
Income statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic
220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expense. 
 The amendments in this update requires public business entities to disclose,
on an annual and interim basis, disaggregated information about certain income statement expense line items in the notes to the financial
statements. Public business entities are required to apply the guidance prospectively and may elect to apply it retrospectively. This
ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December

Acquisitions

Acquisition
of Callin Corp. (Continued)

Under
the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company is required to issue upfront share consideration of 
981,243
 shares of Class A Common
Stock to the preferred shareholders and SAFE note holders of Callin. The fair value of the Company’s Class A Common Stock on the
Acquisition Date was $
9.99
 per share. In addition, the Company issued rights to four payments each consisting of 
375,000
 contingently
issuable shares of Class A Common Stock to the common shareholders, series FF preferred shareholders, option holders and continuing employees
of Callin contingent on the following conditions being met:

●
Retention
payment 1: Services are provided by a selling shareholder for 
12
 months;

●
Retention
payment 2: Services are provided by a selling shareholder for 
24
 months;

●
Milestone
payment 1: Within 
12
 months, certain feature development and technical performance criteria are achieved, and the acquired technology
is integrated into the Company’s existing software and

●
Milestone
payment 2: Within 
24
 months, certain feature development and technical performance criteria are achieved.

In
assessing what is part of the business combination, the Company has determined that because the two retention payments are contingent
on a selling shareholder providing services post-combination, the portion of those tranches earned by the party providing services should
be reflected in the Company’s financial statements as post-combination expense. In addition, where future services are required
by employees in order to earn rights to the contingent consideration, such rights are being accounted for either entirely as post-combination
expense or as replacement awards where the rights replace unvested options or restricted series FF preferred shares that were originally
granted by Callin. Rights to contingent consideration held by non-accredited investors will be settled in cash at $
8.92
 per share. For
the remainder, the four tranches of contingently issuable shares have been accounted for as contingent consideration.

The
following table shows the breakdown of the contingently issuable shares:

Number of Shares

Contingent consideration

903,689

Share-based compensation (Note 14)

596,311

Total contingently issuable shares

1,500,000

During
the year ended December 31, 2024, certain of the contingently issuable shares were issued. Refer to Note 14 for the share-based compensation
and below for the impact on contingent consideration.

The
fair value of the contingent consideration has been estimated as follows:

Retention
payments 1 and 2

At
the Acquisition Date, the Company determined that retention payments 1 and 2 are one unit of account requiring the Company to issue a
variable number of shares that is not indexed to the Company’s stock. As a result, the consideration that is contingent on one
of the selling shareholder’s providing services has been classified as a liability. The contingent consideration is classified
Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The key inputs into the fair value determination are the probability of achieving the milestones,
which impacts the expected number of shares to be issued, and the share price on the Acquisition Date. At the Acquisition Date, management
estimated the number of shares to be issued is 
349,523
.

On
May 15, 2024, retention payment 1 was met resulting in the issuance of 
192,885
 shares of Class A Common Stock and a cash payment of $
137,997
.
Retention payment 2 was reclassified to equity because the number of shares to be issued if the contingency is met is now fixed. As a
result, the Company recognized $
1,334,516
 in equity.

As
of December 31, 2024, it was determined that retention payment 2 was not met, resulting in forfeitures of the rights to contingent consideration.

Company has determined that milestone payments 1 and 2 are separate units of account because a fixed number of shares will be issued
if each contingency is met, and meeting one contingency is not dependent on the other. The key inputs into the fair value determination
are the probability of each contingency being met, and the share price on the Acquisition Date. As of December 31, 2024, milestone payments
1 and 2 were met resulting in the issuance of 
507,636
 shares of Class A Common Stock and a cash payment of $
149,605
.

During
the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company adjusted certain provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date related to the
finalization of the valuation report and the income tax provision in the fourth quarter of 2023. An adjustment was made to increase upfront
share consideration by $
143,716
 as well as an increase to intangible assets and deferred tax liability of $
1,594,000
 and $
398,654
, respectively.
The corresponding adjustment was reflected in goodwill.

The
acquired goodwill relates to Callin’s workforce and synergies that are expected to be realized upon the integration of Callin’s
technology with the Rumble platform. Such synergies will include the ability to leverage the creator relationships that Rumble has secured
to date and will allow for a greater ability to establish brand recognition and monetization of the Callin platform in the future. The
goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

Acquisition-related
transaction costs incurred by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2023 were $
835,035
.

The
acquired business contributed revenues of $
nil
 and net loss of $
1,269,185
 post acquisition for the period ended December 31, 2023.

Acquisitions
(Continued)

Acquisition
of North River Project Inc.

On October 3, 2023, the Company acquired 
100
% of the outstanding
equity of North River Project Inc. ("North River”), for $
10,000,000
 Canadian Dollars ($
7,293,000
 US Dollars) in cash
upfront and future contingent cash payments of up to $
10,000,000
 Canadian Dollars. The Company has determined that North River does
not meet the definition of a business and has accounted for the acquisition as an asset acquisition. The contingent consideration contains
two payments, each consisting of $
5,000,000
 Canadian Dollars upon the completion of feature development and integration of the acquired
technology into the Company’s existing software within a 5-year period. The Company has elected to account for the contingent consideration
at the point in time in which the payments have been met. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the contingent milestones were achieved
and consequently the Company made a total cash payment of $
10,000,000
 Canadian Dollars ($
7,122,868
 US Dollars) to the former
North River equity holders. The Company acquired North River for the purpose of acquiring certain developed software, developed technology,
and an assembled workforce.

The
Company allocated the upfront consideration to the acquired assets based on their relative fair value on the date of acquisition as follows:

The
additions were allocated to the cost basis of the acquired assets and the Company recognized a cumulative catch up on the amortization
expense in the amount of $
1,921,750
 during the year ended December 31, 2024.

The
acquired software and technology was assigned a useful life of 
5
 years and the assembled workforce was assigned a useful life of 
2
 years.
The assets are recorded in intangible assets, net on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

The
Company has assessed the realizability of the net deferred tax assets by considering the relevant positive and negative evidence available
to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. In making such
a determination, the Company considered all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable
temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent results of operations. A significant piece
of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative tax loss incurred by the Company over the three-year period ended December
31, 2024. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as projections for future growth. After
consideration of all these factors, the Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets.

Deferred
income taxes have not been recorded on the basis differences for investments in consolidated subsidiaries as these basis differences
are indefinitely reinvested or will reverse in a non-taxable manner. Quantification of the deferred income tax liability, if any, associated
with indefinitely reinvested basis differences is not practicable.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company has U.S. federal and
state net loss carryforwards of $
104,527,154
 and $
78,563,194
, respectively, as well as Canadian federal and provincial non-capital loss
carryforwards of $
154,084,556
 and $
107,580,614
, respectively. The U.S. federal losses can be carried forward indefinitely, generally,
the state losses can be carried forward 
20
 years. 
The Canadian non-capital loss carryforwards expire between 2039 and 2044.

Income
Taxes (Continued)

Utilization
of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitations in the event of a change in ownership as defined under U.S. IRC Section
382, and similar state provisions. An "ownership change" is generally defined as a cumulative change in the ownership interest
of significant stockholders of more than 50 percentage points over a three-year period. The Company experienced ownership change during
2021. Such ownership change could result in a limitation of the Company's ability to reduce future income by net operating loss carryforwards.
A formal Section 382 study has not been prepared, so the exact effects of the ownership change are not known at this time.

The
Company operates in a number of tax jurisdictions and is subject to examination of its income tax returns by tax authorities in those
jurisdictions who may challenge any item on these returns. Because the tax matters challenged by tax authorities are typically complex,
the ultimate outcome of these challenges is uncertain. The Company recognizes the effects of uncertain tax positions in the consolidated
financial statements after determining that it is more-likely-than-not the uncertain tax positions will be sustained.  As of December
31, 2024, the Company has not recorded any uncertain tax positions, as well as any accrued interest and penalties on the consolidated
balance sheet. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company did not record any interest and penalties in the consolidated statement
of operations.

11.
Derivative
Liability

On
December 20, 2024, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement (the “Transaction Agreement”) for
a strategic investment of $
775
 million (the “Transaction”) from Tether Investments Limited (n/k/a Tether Investments S.A.
de C.V.) (“Tether”) in exchange for 
103,333,333
 shares of Class A Common Stock. The Class A Common Stock has a par value
of $
0.0001
 per share. The purchase price of the Class A Common Stock in the Transaction was $
7.50
 per share.

The Transaction Agreement requires the
Company to commence a tender offer to purchase up to 
70,000,000
 shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock using proceeds from
the Transaction, which the Company did subsequent to year end. See Note 21 for further details.

As contemplated by the Transaction Agreement,
the Company executed support agreements with certain members of key management to provide a backstop to the anticipated tender offer and
ensure 
70,000,000
 shares would be tendered and available for repurchase when the Transaction closes.

Under the Transaction Agreement, there
is the possibility that the Company issues either 
103,333,333
 shares of Class A Common Stock in one or two closings, or issues 
66,666,667

shares of Class A Common Stock in one closing if the tender offer is not successfully consummated by April 30, 2025.

The Company is accounting for the Transaction and support agreement
as one unit of account which meets the definition of a derivative. As a result, the Company initially recorded a gain upon recognition
of a derivative asset of $
9,200,000
 and subsequently recorded the derivative at fair value resulting in a liability of $
184,699,998
 at
December 31, 2024 and a change in fair value of the derivative of $
184,699,998
 during the year ended December 31, 2024. See Note 17 for
further details.

As of December 31, 2024, the Transaction
had not been funded. The Transaction was completed on February 7, 2025. See Note 21 for further details.

Rights to Contingent Consideration

In connection
with the acquisition of Callin as described in Note 3, the Company was required to replace unvested options, unvested series FF preferred
shares, and restricted common stock held by continuing employees of Callin with a right to receive contingent consideration. If the underlying
contingencies are met, the obligation will be satisfied by the issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock. In addition, as described in
Note 3, two of the contingent consideration tranches are dependent on one selling shareholder providing services to the Company.

Where rights
to receive contingent consideration were issued to replace unvested awards of the acquired company, the Company has allocated an amount
to consideration based on the fair value of the original award at the acquisition date. The amount allocated is based on the period of
time vested as of the acquisition date in relation to the greater of the vesting period of the original award and the total service requirement
as per the below. 
The difference between the fair value of the new award on the acquisition date and the amount allocated to consideration
is post-combination expense, as laid out below:

the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

As discussed in Note 3, certain milestones
were met during the year ended December 31, 2024. As a result, 
145,049
 shares of Class A Common Stock were issued and $
2,284,085
 of cash
was paid to settle the rights to contingent consideration. Additionally, retention payment 2 was not met resulting in a reversal of $
1,105,393

in share-based compensation expense.

As of December 31, 2024, there were
no unrecognized compensation cost related to rights with a service only condition.

Loss per Share

As noted in Note 13, when taken together,
an ExchangeCo Share and a share of Class C Common Stock are economically similar to a share of Class A Common Stock. As a result, the
Company computed basic loss per share by dividing net loss attributable to the Company by the weighted-average number of Class A and ExchangeCo
Shares issued and outstanding, excluding those held in escrow as these are contingently issuable shares and have been excluded from the
calculation during the year ended December 31, 2024, and 2023. Shares of Class D Common Stock do not share in earnings and not participating
securities (i.e., non-economic shares) and therefore, have been excluded from the calculation of weighted-average number of shares outstanding.

Diluted loss per share is computed
giving effect to all potentially dilutive shares. Diluted loss per share for all periods presented is the same as basic loss per share
as the inclusion of potentially issuable shares would be antidilutive.

16.
Commitments and Contingencies

Commitments

The Company has non-cancelable contractual
commitments of approximately $
37
 million as of December 31, 2024, which are primarily related to programming and content, leases, and
other service arrangements. The majority of commitments will be paid over two years commencing in 2025.

Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of business, to
facilitate transactions in services and products, the Company indemnifies certain parties. The Company has agreed to hold certain parties
harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims
made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount
of the claim. In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its officers and directors, and its bylaws contain
similar indemnification obligations to its agents.

Furthermore, many of the Company’s
agreements with its customers and partners require the Company to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims
against them, which would increase costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there
were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Customers and partners may discontinue the use of the Company’s services and technologies
as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact the business.

It is not possible to make a reasonable
estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in
each particular agreement. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably
possible.

As of December 31, 2024, Rumble was
defending a lawsuit against the Company and one of its shareholders seeking a variety of relief including rescission of a share redemption
sale agreement with the Company or damages alleged to be worth $
419.0
 million.

The Company is defending the claims
and considers that the likelihood that it will be required to make a payment to plaintiffs to be remote.

2024 and 2023, the number of warrants outstanding was 
8,046,076
 and 
8,050,000
, respectively, with a weighted-average exercise price of
$

. The warrants are exercisable and will expire on September 16, 2027, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. All warrants are
publicly traded.

Derivative liability

The derivative liability relates to the net new shares from the Tether
transaction. Refer to Note 11. The derivative has been valued using the Monte Carlo simulation methodology that included simulating the
stock price using a risk-neutral Geometric Brownian Motion-based pricing model. 
The key inputs used in the model include:

Contingent consideration

The contingent consideration liability
arose in May 2023 from the Callin acquisition. Refer to Note 3. The increase in fair value during the year is attributable to changes
in the Company’s stock price and the increased probability of each contingency being met. On May 15, 2024, the contingent consideration
liability was derecognized. One of the contingent payments was settled through the issuance of shares and the remaining contingent payment
was reclassified to equity and accounts payable.

Credit and Concentration Risks

Credit risk is the risk that one party
to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation. The Company is exposed
to credit risk resulting from the possibility that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument defaults on their financial obligations
or if there is a concentration of transactions carried out with the same counterparty. Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable.

The Company’s cash, cash equivalents,
and marketable securities are held in reputable banks in its country of domicile and management believes the risk of loss to be remote.
We maintain cash balances that exceed the insured limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Canada Deposit Insurance
Corporation.

The Company is exposed to credit risk
in the event of default by its customers. Accounts receivables are recorded at the invoiced amount, do not bear interest, and do not
require collateral. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, one customer accounted for $
14,927,000
 and $
36,973,000
 or 
16
% and

46
% of revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, no single customer represented 10% or more of total accounts receivable. As of
December 31, 2023, one customer accounted for 
35
% of accounts receivable.

19.
Related Party Transactions

The Company’s related parties
include directors, shareholders and key management.

Compensation to related parties
totaled $
14,063,586
 and $
13,008,425
 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of the total compensation, the
Company paid share-based compensation to key management amounting to $
9,837,559
 and $
8,046,363
 for the years ended December
31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, accounts receivable from key management personnel were $
727,903
 and
$
nil
, respectively.

The Company has a vendor relationship
with Cosmic Inc. and Kosmik Development Skopje doo (“Cosmic”) to provide content moderation and software development services.
Cosmic is controlled by Mr. Pavlovski and Mr. Milnes, each of whom holds a significant number of Rumble shares. The Company incurred related
party expenses for these services of $
3,382,267
 and $
2,849,600
 during the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Accounts
payable and accrued liabilities for personnel services was $
249,545
 and $
276,018
 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

As discussed in Note 11, on December 20, 2024 the Company entered into
support agreements with related parties to ensure that 
70,000,000
 shares of Class A Common Stock would be tendered and available for purchase
if there were insufficient shares tendered by the public to satisfy the tender requirements in the Tether Agreement.

There were no other related party transactions
during these periods.

Subsequent Events

As previously announced in November 2024,
the Company’s Board of Directors has approved a corporate treasury diversification strategy of allocating a portion of the Company’s
cash reserves to Bitcoin. This move emphasizes Rumble's belief in Bitcoin as a valuable tool for strategic planning and is designed to
accelerate the Company's expansion into cryptocurrency. Rumble's Bitcoin allocation strategy will include purchases, at the discretion
of the company, of up to $
20
 million. Subsequent to year end, the Company has purchased approximately $
17
 million in Bitcoin.

On January 3, 2025, as required by the Tether Arrangement discussed in Note 11, the Company commenced a self-tender
offer to purchase up to 
70,000,000
 of its issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock.

On February 7, 2025, the Company closed
its strategic investment with from Tether by issuing 
103,333,333
 shares of Class A Common Stock at a price of $
7.50
 per share to Tether
for $
775
 million in gross proceeds, and on the same date, repurchasing 
70,000,000
 shares of Class A Common Stock under the self-tender,
totaling $
525
 million, excluding fees and expenses related to the tender, resulting in a net new issuance of 
33,333,333
 shares of Class
A Common Stock. Of the 
70,000,000
 shares of Class A Common Stock repurchased, 
69,938,983
 were tendered by related parties with whom the
Company had executed support agreements. To satisfy the conditions under the support agreements, 
20,783,200
 vested stock options were
exercised for $
1,395,932
 and 
41,463,151
 shares of Class C Common Stock (and its corresponding ExchangeCo Share) were exchanged for Class
A Common Stock.

In accordance with ASC 855, the
Company’s management reviewed all material events through March 25, 2025, and there were no material subsequent events other than
those disclosed above.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting
and Financial Disclosure 

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the
Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.

Because of its inherent limitations,
our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can
only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.

Management assessed the effectiveness
of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in the SEC guidance on conducting such
assessments as of the end of the period covered by this report. Management conducted the assessment based on certain criteria established
in the Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission in
2013. Based on such an evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our internal control over
financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2024 due to the material weaknesses described below.  

Material Weakness

A material weakness is a deficiency,
or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a timely manner.

The Company did not sufficiently maintain the risk assessment and control
activities components of the COSO framework primarily relating to (i) identifying and analyzing risks, including identifying and assessing
changes in the business that could impact the system of internal controls and (ii) sufficiency of selecting and developing control activities
that contribute to the mitigation of risks to the achievement of objectives to acceptable levels. This led to material weaknesses whereby,
we did not adequately design certain key controls at a sufficient level of precision, including account reconciliation, to address relevant
financial reporting risks including inadequate design of procedures to ensure completeness and accuracy of the accounting for content
creator agreements, and associated assets, liabilities and expenses.

Deficiencies in control activities contributed to the potential for
there to have been material accounting errors in financial statement account balances and disclosures. While the above material weaknesses
did not result in a material misstatement of our previously issued financial statements, it could result in a misstatement of our account
balances or disclosures that would not be prevented or detected and would therefore result in a material misstatement of our annual or
interim financial statements.

See Risk Factors – We have identified material weaknesses in
our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. If we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses, we may
not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations. 

Remediation Activities

We and our Board of Directors
are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. Management, with the oversight of the audit committee of our Board
of Directors have evaluated the material weaknesses and have implemented a remediation plan to address the material weaknesses and enhance
our control environment. We are taking steps to strengthen our internal control over financial reporting through the continued hiring
of additional appropriately skilled finance and accounting personnel with the requisite technical knowledge and skills. With the additional
skilled personnel, we are taking appropriate and reasonable steps to remediate these material weaknesses through formalization of accounting
policies and controls around content creator agreements, and retention of external accounting advisors for complex accounting transactions.
We will not be able to fully remediate material weaknesses until these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively for
a sufficient period of time.

54

Management will continue
to review and make necessary changes to the overall design of our internal control environment, as well as policies and procedures to
improve the overall effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated,
however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these
controls are operating effectively.

Part

Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance

Family Relationships

There are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive
officers.

Controlled Company

For purposes of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, we
are a “controlled company.” Under the Nasdaq rules, controlled companies are companies of which more than 50% of the
voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group, or another company. Chris Pavlovski owns approximately
83% of the outstanding voting power, on a fully diluted basis, for the election of directors. As a “controlled company,”
we are exempt from the requirement that a majority of the Board of Directors be independent.

Director Independence

Our common stock is listed on Nasdaq. As required
under Nasdaq listing standards (other than with respect to a “controlled company,” which our company is), a majority of the
members of a listed company’s board of directors must qualify as “independent,” as affirmatively determined by the board
of directors. In addition, the Nasdaq listing standards require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company’s
audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance committees be “independent.” Our Board of Directors consults
with our counsel to ensure that the Board of Directors’ determinations are consistent with relevant securities and other laws and
regulations regarding the definition of “independent,” including those set forth in pertinent listing standards of Nasdaq,
as in effect from time to time.

The Board of Directors has reviewed the independence
of each director. Based on information provided by each director concerning her or his background, employment and affiliations, the Board
of Directors affirmatively determined that none of the directors has any relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent
judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of the directors, other than Mr. Pavlovski and Mr. Milnes,
is “independent” as that term is defined under the Nasdaq listing standards.

Board of Directors Leadership Structure

Our Bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines
provide our Board of Directors with flexibility to combine or separate the positions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive
Officer in accordance with its determination that utilizing one or the other structure would be in the best interests of our Company.
Mr. Pavlovski currently serves in a combined role of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer.

Our Board of Directors exercises its judgment
in combining or separating the roles of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer as it deems appropriate in light
of prevailing circumstances. The Board of Directors will continue to exercise its judgment on an ongoing basis to determine the optimal
leadership structure that the Board of Directors believes will provide effective leadership, oversight and direction, while optimizing
the functioning of both the Board of Directors and management and facilitating effective communication between the two. The Board of Directors
has concluded that the current structure provides a well-functioning and effective balance between strong Company leadership and appropriate
safeguards and oversight by independent directors. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that an independent “lead director”
will be elected from among the independent directors when the Chairperson of the Board is not an independent director to preside over
executive sessions among non-management directors which are to be held at least annually. Our Board of Directors has elected Robert Arsov
as the independent “lead director.”

Role of the Board of Directors in Risk Oversight

One of the key functions of the Board of Directors
is the informed oversight of our risk management process. The Board of Directors does not have a standing risk management committee, but
rather administers this oversight function directly through the Board of Directors as a whole, as well as through various standing committees
of the Board of Directors that address risks inherent in their respective areas of oversight. In particular, the Board of Directors is
responsible for reviewing the major risks facing our company and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the “
Audit
Committee
”) has the responsibility to review and discuss with management and the independent auditor any significant risks
or exposures and our company’s policies and processes with respect to risk assessment and risk management. The Audit Committee also
monitors compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the “
Compensation
Committee
”) also assesses and monitors whether our compensation plans, policies and programs comply with applicable legal
and regulatory requirements.

Meetings of The Board of Directors and Its Committees

The Board of Directors met twenty-one times, the
Audit Committee met ten times, the Compensation Committee met five times, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met three
times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. Each director attended 75% or more of the aggregate number of meetings of the
Board of Directors and of the committees on which he or she served held during the year ended December 31, 2024.

56

We expect our directors and nominees for director
to attend the Annual Meeting.

Information Regarding Committees of the Board of Directors

The Board of Directors has established standing
committees in connection with the discharge of its responsibilities. These committees include an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee
and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Pursuant to our Bylaws, the Board of Directors may establish such other committees
as may be permitted by law. The following table provides current membership information for each of these Board of Directors committees:

The functions of the committee include:

●

establishment and review the objectives of the management compensation programs and basic compensation policies;

Compensation Consultants

During the fiscal year ended December 31,
2024, the Compensation Committee retained Mercer as its compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee requested that Mercer:

●

provide market information, analysis, and other advice relating to executive compensation on an ongoing basis;

●

advise on the updates to the Company’s peer group and provide support and analysis regarding executive and director compensation;

●

support with the annual CEO evaluation process;

●

complete a Board of Directors compensation assessment and recommendations;

●

advise on the executive succession planning process;

●

evaluate the efficacy of our existing compensation strategy and practices in supporting and reinforcing our long-term strategic goals; and

●

assist in refining our compensation strategy and in implementing our executive compensation program to execute that strategy.

As part of its engagement, Mercer was requested
by the Compensation Committee to develop and continually update a comparative group of peer companies and to perform analyses of competitive
performance and compensation levels and design for that group. At the request of the Compensation Committee, Mercer also engaged in discussions
with members of the Compensation Committee and senior management to learn more about our business operations and strategy, key performance
metrics and strategic goals, as well as the labor markets in which we compete. Following an active dialogue with Mercer, the Compensation
Committee considered Mercer’s input as part of its decision-making process.

The Compensation Committee has evaluated its relationship
with Mercer to ensure that it believes that such firm is independent from management. This review process included a review of the services
that Mercer provided, the quality of those services and the fees associated with the services provided during the fiscal year ended December 31,
2024. Based on this review, as well as consideration of the factors affecting independence set forth in Exchange Act Rule 10C-1(b)(4),
Rule 5605(d)(3)(D) of the Nasdaq listing standards, and such other factors as were deemed relevant under the circumstances,
the Compensation Committee has determined that no conflict of interest was raised as a result of the work performed by Mercer.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider
Participation

Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee

The members of our nominating
committee consist of Robert Arsov, Nancy Armstrong and Katie Biber. Robert Arsov serves as the chairman of the committee. The Nasdaq
Listing Rules require that the nominating committee of a listed company (other than that of a “controlled company,”
which our company is) be composed solely of independent directors, and each of Robert Arsov, Nancy Armstrong and Katie Biber qualify
as independent directors under applicable rules.

Corporate Governance Guidelines

Our Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance
Guidelines to assure that the Board of Directors will have the necessary authority and practices in place to review and evaluate our business
operations as needed and to make decisions that are independent of our management. The guidelines are also intended to align the interests

Insider Trading Policy

Our Board of Directors has adopted an insider
trading policy that applies to our employees, directors, and certain consultants. This policy prohibits, among other things, trading of
the company securities during specified blackout periods and engaging in short sales of company securities.

Hedging, Pledging and Other Special Transactions

Pursuant to our insider trading policy, we discourage
our employees, directors and officers from engaging in certain transactions, including the placing of standing or limit orders on company
securities as well as engaging in transactions in put options, call options or similar derivative securities that are traded on an exchange
or in any other organized market. If a person subject to the policy determines that he or she must engage in such a transaction, the transaction
must comply with our pre-clearance and blackout processes. Our directors, officers and other employees are generally not prohibited from
engaging in hedging or pledging transactions involving company securities.

Stockholder Communications with the Board of Directors

Our stockholders wishing to communicate with the
Board of Directors or an individual director may send a written communication to the Board of Directors or such director addressed to
c/o Rumble Inc., 444 Gulf of Mexico Drive, Longboat Key, FL 34228, Attn: Corporate Secretary. The Secretary will review each communication.
The Secretary will forward such communication to the Board of Directors or to any individual director to whom the communication is addressed
unless the communication contains advertisements or solicitations or is unduly hostile, threatening or similarly inappropriate, in which
case the Secretary will discard the communication or inform the proper authorities, as may be appropriate.

Item 11. Executive Compensation

Emerging Growth Company Status

We are an “emerging growth company,”

Processes and Procedures for Compensation Decisions

Our compensation program is designed to:

attract, incentivize, and retain
employees at the executive level who contribute to our long-term success;

●
provide compensation packages
to our executives that are fair and competitive, and that reward the achievement of our business objectives; and

●
effectively align our executives’
interests with those of our stockholders by focusing on long-term equity incentives that correlate with the creation of long-term value
for our stockholders.

Under its charter, our Compensation Committee
has the right to retain or obtain the advice of compensation consultants, independent legal counsel and other advisers. During the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2024, our Compensation Committee retained Mercer to provide the committee with market information, analysis,
and other advice relating to executive compensation on an ongoing basis. Mercer also assisted in developing an updated group of peer companies
to help us determine the appropriate level of overall compensation for our executive officers and non-employee directors, as well as to
assess each separate element of executive officer and non-employee director compensation, with a goal of ensuring that the compensation
we offer to our executive officers and non-employee directors is competitive, fair, and appropriately structured. Mercer does not provide
any non-compensation consulting-related services to us. Mercer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.

Narrative to Summary Compensation Table

Arrangements with Named Executive Officers

We have entered into employment agreements with each of our NEOs which
are summarized below.

Chris Pavlovski

Upon consummation of the Business Combination,
we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Pavlovski in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer. The employment agreement provides
for an indefinite term of employment, during which time Mr. Pavlovski is entitled to an annual base salary of $1,000,000; an annual
bonus with a target of 50% of his then annual salary, payable subject to Mr. Pavlovski’s continued employment through the payment
date; a one-time cash bonus of $750,000 payable upon the closing of the Business Combination; a one-time grant of 1,100,000 restricted
shares of Class A Common Stock (which were granted as RSUs in lieu of restricted shares), which vest in substantially equal annual
installments for three years following the closing of the Business Combination, subject to Mr. Pavlovski’s continued employment
through each vesting date; and an annual equity grant with a value of up to $4,000,000 during his employment. The employment agreement
also provides that Mr. Pavlovski will be eligible to participate in all employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements made available
to our employees or, if no such plans exist, Mr. Pavlovski will receive reimbursement of medical and dental costs for himself, his
spouse and dependents, until such time that we have medical and dental insurance plans in place. Additionally, during the term of employment,
Mr. Pavlovski is entitled to long-term disability insurance coverage equal to at least 80% of his annual salary regardless of whether
such benefit is offered to other similarly situated executives and at no expense to him. The employment agreement contains an indefinite
non-disparage provision, customary confidentiality and invention assignment covenants, as well as non-competition and employee and customer
non-solicitation covenants that apply during the term of employment and for a period of one year thereafter. If Mr. Pavlovski is
terminated without “cause” or due to his resignation for “good reason” (each as defined in Mr. Pavlovski’s
employment agreement), subject to his execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in favor of us and our affiliates and
his continued compliance with the restrictive covenants in the employment agreement, he will be entitled to severance consisting of (i) any
unpaid annual bonus in respect of any completed performance period that has ended prior to the date of such termination or pro rata portion
thereof, which amount will be paid at such time annual bonuses are paid to our other senior executives, and (ii) (x) payment
of his regular wages in lieu of the minimum amount of working notice of termination prescribed by the Ontario Employment Standards Act,
2000 (“
ESA
”), (y) statutory severance pay, if any, prescribed by the ESA, and (z) any other minimum
statutory entitlement that may be payable to Mr. Pavlovski under the ESA, without duplication. Additionally, on September 16,
2022, Mr. Pavlovski entered into an amendment to the employment agreement pursuant to which Mr. Pavlovski’s salary will
be paid in Canadian dollars, in lieu of U.S. dollars. The amendment to the Employment Agreement does not alter, amend or supersede
any other terms of the employment agreement.

Tyler Hughes

In November 2022 we entered into an
employment agreement with Tyler Hughes. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Hughes is entitled to an initial annual base salary of
CDN$532,731 per year, payable in Canadian dollars, and is eligible to earn an annual bonus based upon the achievement of performance
targets established for the applicable calendar year, with a target annual bonus equal to 50% of base salary and a maximum annual
bonus equal to 100% of base salary.

63

Pursuant to the agreement, if Mr. Hughes’
employment is terminated either (x) by the Company without “cause” or (y) by Mr. Hughes for “good reason”,
subject to Mr. Hughes’ execution of a general release of claims in favor of the Company and its affiliates and compliance with
any restrictive covenants to which Mr. Hughes is subject in favor of the Company and its affiliates, Mr. Hughes will be entitled
to, in addition to any payments required by the ESA, (i) any unpaid annual bonus in respect of any completed fiscal year that has
ended on or before the termination date; (ii) a prorated target annual bonus for the calendar year in which such termination occurs;
(iii) continued participation in the Company’s health and dental plans for 12 months (or such longer time as required
by the ESA); (iv) an amount equal to Mr. Hughes’ annual base salary less any amounts paid or payable to Mr. Hughes
during any ESA required notice period (or pay in lieu of notice), payable in either a lump sum or installments in the Company’s
sole discretion; (v) an amount equal to the Mr. Hughes’ target annual bonus for the year of termination, payable during
the 12-month period following termination in accordance with the Company’s regular payroll practices; and (vi) continued vesting
during the 12-month period following termination of any time-based equity awards that are outstanding and unvested as of such termination.

Michael Ellis

In November 2022 we entered into an employment
agreement with Michael Ellis. Pursuant to the agreement, Mr. Ellis is entitled to an initial base salary of $400,000 per year and
is eligible to earn an annual bonus based upon the achievement of performance targets established for the applicable calendar year, with
a target annual bonus equal to 50% of his base salary and a maximum annual bonus equal to 100% of his base salary.

Pursuant to the agreement, if Mr. Ellis’s
employment is terminated either (x) by the Company without “cause” or (y) by Mr. Ellis for “good reason,”
subject to his execution of a general release of claims in favor of the Company and its affiliates and compliance with any restrictive
covenants to which Mr. Ellis is subject in favor of the Company and its affiliates, Mr. Ellis will be entitled to: (i) any
unpaid annual bonus in respect of any completed fiscal year that has ended on or before the termination date; (ii) a prorated target
annual bonus for the calendar year in which such termination occurs; (iii) subsidized premiums for continued coverage under the Company’s
group health plan for up to 12 months; (iv) an amount equal to the sum of (x) Mr. Ellis’s annual base salary,
plus (y) the target annual bonus for the year of termination, payable during the 12-month period following termination in accordance
with the Company’s regular payroll practices; and (v) continued vesting during the 12-month period following termination of
any time-based equity awards that are outstanding and unvested as of such termination.

Mr. Ellis resigned as General Counsel and Corporate
Secretary of the Company, effective upon the close of business on the Ellis Separation Date, to pursue a position in government. In connection
with Mr. Ellis’s resignation, in recognition of his significant contributions to the Company, the Compensation Committee determined
to provide Mr. Ellis with the following payment and benefits: (i) a one-time cash bonus payment of $1,000,000, to be paid on the Ellis
Separation Date; (ii) accelerated vesting of all of Mr. Ellis’s stock options and restricted stock units outstanding as of the Ellis
Separation Date; and (iii) an extension of the post-termination exercise period of Mr. Ellis’s stock options until the earlier of
the fifth anniversary of the Ellis Separation Date and the original expiration date of the stock options.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change
of Control

None of our NEOs is entitled to any potential
payments or benefits in connection with a termination of their employment or a change in control of the Company, other than as described
above set forth in their employment agreements.

Base Salary

Base salaries are intended to provide a level
of compensation sufficient to attract and retain an effective management team, when considered in combination with the other components
of the executive compensation program. In general, we seek to provide a base salary level designed to reflect each NEO’s scope of
responsibility and accountability.

64

Bonus Compensation

Our management team is eligible for short-term
incentive compensation through the STIP. Cash incentives hold our management team accountable, reward them based on actual business
results and help create a “pay for performance” culture. Our STIP provides cash incentive award opportunities for the achievement
of performance goals established by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of the fiscal year. Payouts to participants vary based
on performance as compared to the target performance goals established by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee and the
CEO also retain discretion to adjust payouts for any factors that are deemed appropriate. We awarded bonuses in the amount of $232,870
to Mr. Pavlovski, $95,000 to Mr. Ellis, and $92,372 to Mr. Hughes pursuant to the STIP for their service in 2024. In addition, the Compensation
Committee awarded a one-time cash bonus in the amount of $1,000 to Mr. Hughes for exceeding expectations in his role during 2024.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation

In connection with the Business Combination, we
adopted and approved the 2022 Plan under which the Company is permitted to grant equity-based awards, including RSUs and Company Options.
Pursuant to the 2022 Plan for the year 2024, on April 3, 2024 we granted (i) a Company Option to purchase 449,646 shares of common stock
with a grant date fair value of $1,874,520 to Mr. Pavlovski, a Company Option to purchase 181,336 shares of common stock with a grant
date fair value of $757,984 to Mr. Ellis, and a Company Option to purchase 178,360 shares of common stock with a grant date fair value
of $745,545 to Mr. Hughes; and (ii) 92,800 time-based RSUs with a grant date fair value of $619,904 to Mr. Pavlovski, 37,425 time-based
RSUs with a grant date fair value of $249,999 to Mr. Ellis, and 36,810 time-based RSUs with a grant date fair value of $245,891 to Mr.
Hughes. Awards granted to our NEOs under the 2022 Plan generally vest in either three or four equal annual installments of the grant date.

In connection with the Business Combination, we
assumed the Rumble Inc. Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan (the “
Prior Plan
”), which continues to govern
the terms and conditions of the outstanding options previously granted under the Prior Plan, and all options outstanding immediately prior
to the effective time of the Business Combination were converted into options to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock in connection
therewith.

The Rumble Inc. 2024 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
(the “
2024 ESPP
”) was approved by stockholders on June 14, 2024, 2024 to allow the Company to provide its employees
and employees of certain designated subsidiaries and affiliates an opportunity to obtain a proprietary interest in the continued growth
and prosperity of the Company through ownership of its shares of common stock. For employees of participating affiliates in countries
outside of the United States, the 2024 ESPP will be effectuated via separate offerings under one or more sub-plans of the 2024 ESPP in
order to achieve tax, employment, securities law or other purposes and objectives, and to conform the terms of the sub-plans with the
laws and requirements of such countries. Subject to adjustment for certain changes in recapitalization or reorganization, the maximum
aggregate number of the Company’s shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2024 ESPP is 1,500,000 shares. The 2024 ESPP
became effective as of the first available offering date, which was on March 26, 2024.

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation

Our NEOs did not participate in, or earn any benefits
under, any nonqualified deferred compensation plan sponsored by Rumble during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. Our Board
of Directors may elect to provide our NEOs and other employees with nonqualified deferred compensation benefits in the future if it determines
that doing so is in our best interests.

Pension Benefits

Our NEOs did not participate in, or otherwise
receive any benefits under, any pension or retirement plan sponsored by Rumble during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.

65

No Tax Gross-Ups

In the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024,
with the exception of reimbursements for foreign tax preparation for Mr. Pavlovski and Mr. Hughes, we did not make gross-up payments to
cover the personal income taxes of our NEOs that pertained to any of the compensation, perquisites or personal benefits paid or provided
by us.

Health and Welfare Benefits

We provide benefits to our NEOs on the same basis
as provided to all of our employees, including health, dental and vision insurance; and life and disability insurance. We do not maintain
any executive-specific benefit or perquisite programs.

Rule 10b5-1 Plans

Our directors and executive officers may adopt
written plans, known as Rule 10b5-1 plans, in which they will contract with a broker to buy or sell shares of common stock on a periodic
basis. Under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, a broker executes trades pursuant to parameters established by the director or executive officer
when entering into the plan, without further direction from them. The director or executive officer may amend a Rule 10b5-1 plan
in some circumstances and may terminate a plan at any time. Our directors and executive officers also may buy or sell additional shares
outside of a Rule 10b5-1 plan when they are not in possession of material nonpublic information, subject to compliance with the terms
of our insider trading policy.

Outstanding Equity Awards as of December 31, 2024

The following table shows certain information
regarding outstanding equity awards held by each of our NEOs at December 31, 2024. All of the outstanding equity awards were granted

The number of options was determined after applying the exchange ratio pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, such that for each option that was outstanding prior to the effective date of the Business Combination Agreement, such option was converted into a new option to purchase (i) a number of Class A Common Stock of the Company equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (x) the number of shares originally underlying such option, and (y) 16.474 (the “Option Exchange Ratio” and the Class A Common Stock of the Company described in this clause (i), being the “Base Option Shares”), and (ii) and for each Base Option Share, a fraction of a Class A Common Stock of the Company equal to 0.4915 of a share (the shares described in this clause (ii), the “
Tandem Option Earnout Shares
”). The aggregate exercise price per Base Option Share together with the related fraction of the Tandem Option Earnout Share is equal to (A) the exercise price originally applicable to the option, divided by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent).

Mr. Ellis resigned as General Counsel and Corporate Secretary as of February 7, 2025.

Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial
Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters

Directors and Executive Officers

The following table sets forth information regarding
the beneficial ownership of shares of our different classes of voting securities (i.e., Class A Common Stock, Class C Common
Stock and Class D Common Stock), as of February 21, 2025, by:

●
each person known by us to be
the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common stock;

●
each of our directors and nominees
for director;

●
each of our executive officers;
and

●
all of our executive officers
and directors as a group.

Beneficial ownership is
determined according to the rules of the SEC, which generally provide that a person has beneficial ownership of a security if he,
she or it possesses sole or shared voting or investment power over that security, including options and warrants that are currently
exercisable or exercisable within 60 days. For example, in the event a holder of Company stock options (“
Company
Options
”) has the right to exercise such Company Options within 60 days, such underlying shares are reflected in such
holder’s beneficial ownership in both the numerator and the denominator, but not in the denominator for other unaffiliated
holders, in accordance with the rules of the SEC. In addition, such securities held by all of Rumble’s directors and executive
officers are included in both the numerator and denominator for purposes of determining the percentage share ownership held by the
directors and executive officers, calculated as a group. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order to avoid a distorted and
potentially misleading presentation of percentage share ownership by a holder, all shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon
exchange of any issued and outstanding exchangeable shares of the Company’s subsidiary 1000045728 Ontario Inc.
(“
ExchangeCo Shares
”) (together with all issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock and
ExchangeCo Shares subject to escrow restrictions under the Business Combination Agreement) are included in the denominator for all
holders. In accordance with the foregoing methodology, the determination of the percentage of beneficial ownership in the below
presentation is based on 338,219,266 shares of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding as of February 21, 2025 (which number is
inclusive of shares referenced in the preceding sentence) and the calculation described in footnote (2) below. Unless otherwise
noted, the business address of each of the following individuals is c/o Rumble Inc., 444 Gulf of Mexico Drive, Longboat Key, FL
34228.

The Company has two other classes of equity securities outstanding, Class C Common Stock and Class D Common Stock, the beneficial ownership of which is set forth in the table below. Both Class C Common Stock and Class D Common Stock are non-economic, voting shares that are issued solely for voting purposes. Each holder of ExchangeCo Shares was issued one “tandem” share of Class C Common Stock, which serves to provide the holder thereof with the same voting rights at the Company as one share of Class A Common Stock. The Company views each ExchangeCo Share and its corresponding share of Class C Common Stock as one unit of account that is economically similar to a share of Class A Common Stock. The Company issued shares of Class D Common Stock to Christopher Pavlovski to provide Mr. Pavlovski with high vote stock, with each share carrying 11.2663 votes per share. The percentage of voting power is based on the total number of shares beneficially owned by each holder, and taking into account the shares of high vote Class D Common Stock held by Christopher Pavlovski.

(2)

The percentage of beneficial ownership of Class A Common Stock as to any person or group of persons is calculated by dividing (i) the number of shares of Class A Common Stock beneficially owned by such person or group of persons (including the number of shares of Class A Common Stock as to which such person or group of persons has the right to acquire within 60 days of February 21, 2025), by (ii) the sum of (A) 338,219,266 shares of Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding as of February 21, 2025 (which number is determined as described in the paragraph preceding this table) plus (B) the number of shares as to which such person or group of persons has the right to acquire pursuant to Company Stock Options and Company restricted stock units (“
RSUs
”) within 60 days of February 21, 2025. Consequently, the denominator for calculating beneficial ownership percentages may be different for each person or group of persons in the table.

(3)

Includes (i) 95,045,969 ExchangeCo Shares, of which 34,858,165 ExchangeCo Shares are subject to escrow restrictions pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement; (ii) 34,501,881 shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of options, of which 11,335,655 shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such options are subject to escrow restrictions pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement; and (iii) a grant of RSUs covering 1,100,000 shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Rumble Inc. 2022 Stock Incentive Plan (the “
2022 Plan
”), which RSUs, subject to Christopher Pavlovski’s continuous employment through the applicable vesting dates, vested or will vest in one-third installments on each of September 16, 2023, September 16, 2024 and September 16, 2025.

Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports 

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our
directors, executive officers, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our common stock, to file reports of beneficial ownership
and changes in beneficial ownership with the SEC. To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the reports filed by or on behalf of our
directors and executive officers and written representations from these persons that no other reports were required, we believe that during
the year ended December 31, 2024 our directors, executive officers and holders of more than 10% of our common stock filed the required
reports on a timely basis under Section 16(a).

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related
Transactions, and Director Independence

Other than compensation arrangements for our directors
and executive officers, which are described in the section titled “
Executive Compensation
”, below is a description
of transactions during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 to which we were a party or will be a party, in which:

●
the amounts involved exceeded
or will exceed $120,000; and

●
any of our directors, executive
officers or holders of more than 5% of any class of our capital stock, or any member of the immediate family of, or person sharing the
household with, the foregoing persons, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.

Cosmic

Prior to December 31, 2021,
Rumble was a party to the several agreements with Kosmik Development Skopje doo (“
Cosmic
”), pursuant to which
Cosmic provided content editing and moderation services to Rumble. Cosmic is controlled by Mr. Pavlovski and Ryan Milnes. Mr. Milnes
owns a significant number of shares of our common stock through his holding entity. As part of the Business Combination, effective as
of December 31, 2021, agreements with Cosmic then in place were amended and restated (other than one agreement, which was terminated)
to, among other things, provide a “cost” plus 10% fee structure, clarify payment terms and include performance standards
in favor of Rumble. Under the amended agreements with Cosmic, Cosmic continues to provide content editing and moderation services, along
with other business process outsourcing services, as requested by Rumble. Any intellectual property created by Cosmic pursuant to the
terms of the amended agreements has been assigned to Rumble. The amended agreements provide for an initial term of 24 months, subject
to automatic renewals for subsequent 12-month terms unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least 6 months
prior to the expiration of the current term. In fiscal years 2024 and 2023, Cosmic received approximately $3,382,267 and $2,849,600,
respectively, in service fees from Rumble under the amended and restated agreements with Cosmic.

Tether Investment

On December 20, 2024, the Company entered into
a Transaction Agreement with Tether, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions of the Transaction Agreement, Tether agreed
to make a strategic investment in the Company of $775 million, consisting of 103,333,333 newly issued shares of the Class A Common Stock
at a price of $7.50 per share (the “Investment”). On February 7, 2025, the Company and Tether closed the Investment, and the
Company issued and sold 103,333,333 shares of Class A Common Stock to Tether for the purchase price described above. Pursuant to a Registration
Rights Agreement, the Company has registered the offer and sale of the Class A Common Stock issued to Tether to satisfy its obligations
thereunder. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, Tether also has customary piggyback and demand registration rights. Descriptions
of the Transaction Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement are contained in the Company's Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the
SEC on December 23, 2024 and on February 7, 2025.

Policies and Procedures for Related Person Transactions

Our Board of Directors has adopted a written related
person transactions policy that sets forth our policies and procedures regarding the identification, review, consideration and oversight
of “related person transactions.” For purposes of our policy only, a “related person transaction” is any transaction,
arrangement, or relationship, or any series of similar transactions, arrangements, or relationships, in which we are a participant involving
an amount that will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year, and any related party has or will have a direct or indirect
material interest. Under the policy, the related person in question or, in the case of transactions with a holder of more than 5% of any
class of our voting securities, an officer with knowledge of a proposed transaction, must notify the General Counsel of the facts and
circumstances of the proposed transaction. If the General Counsel determines that the transaction could constitute a related party transaction,
the General Counsel will report such transaction, together with a summary of the material facts, to the Audit Committee for consideration
at the next regularly scheduled Audit Committee meeting. In considering a related person transaction, our Audit Committee will take several
considerations into account, including:

71

●
whether the transaction was
undertaken in the ordinary course of business;

●
whether the transaction was
initiated by the Company or the related party;

●
the availability of other sources
of comparable products or services;

●
whether the transaction is proposed
to be, or was, entered into on terms no less favorable to the Company than terms that could have been reached with an unrelated third
party;

●
the purpose of, and the potential
benefits to the Company of, the transaction;

●
the approximate dollar value
of the amount involved in the transaction, particularly as it relates to the related party; and

●
the related party’s interest
in the transaction;

Our Audit Committee will approve only those transactions that it determines
are fair to us and in our best interests. All of the transactions described above were entered into prior to the adoption of such policy.

Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services

Moss Adams LLP currently serves as our independent
registered public accounting firm. After consideration of Moss Adams LLP’s qualifications and past performance, the Audit Committee
has selected, and the Board of Directors ratified the selection of Moss Adams LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm
for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025. The Board of Directors has directed that management submit the selection of Moss Adams
LLP for ratification by our stockholders at the Annual Meeting. Representatives of Moss Adams LLP are expected to be present at the Annual
Meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

Neither our Bylaws nor other governing documents
or law require stockholder ratification of the selection of Moss Adams LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. However,
the Audit Committee has opted to submit the selection of Moss Adams LLP to our stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate
practice. If our stockholders fail to ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain Moss Adams LLP. Even
if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee or the Board of Directors, in their discretion, may direct the appointment of different
independent auditors at any time during our fiscal year if they determine that such a change would be in the best interests of Rumble
and its stockholders.

CHANGE IN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED ACCOUNTING FIRM

On August 10, 2023, the Audit Committee replaced
MNP LLP with Moss Adams LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2023. MNP LLP had served as the Company’s auditor since 2019.

MNP LLP’s reports on our consolidated financial
statements issued during each of the two years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer
of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.

During the two years ended December 31, 2022 and
December 31, 2021, and during the subsequent interim period through August 10, 2023, (i) there were no disagreements (within the meaning
of Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act and the related instructions thereto) between the Company and MNP LLP on
any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements,
if not resolved to MNP LLP’s satisfaction, would have caused MNP LLP to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements
in connection with its reports on our consolidated financial statements for such years, and (ii) there were no reportable events (as defined
by Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act).

72

We provided MNP LLP with a copy of the foregoing
disclosures and received a letter from MNP LLP addressed to the SEC stating that it agreed with the statements made by us set forth above.
A copy of MNP LLP’s letter, dated August 14, 2023, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to our Current Report on Form-8-K, filed with the SEC
on August 14, 2023.

PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES

The following table summarizes the fees for services
rendered by Moss Adams LLP for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

As an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting
company, we are exempt from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and as a result,
our audit fees are significantly lower than if we were required to provide an auditor attestation under Section 404(b). Depending
on our public float as of June 30, 2025, we may become subject to the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025, which would require us to incur significant additional costs
and to re-assess our required audit services for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025 with our independent registered public
accounting firm.
