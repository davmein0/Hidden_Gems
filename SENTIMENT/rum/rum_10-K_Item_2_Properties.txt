Item 2. Properties 

We are headquartered in Longboat
Key, Florida, and maintain offices in both the United States and Canada. Some of our employees work remotely. All of our facilities are
leased. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our current needs. We intend to procure additional space in the future
as we continue to add employees and expand geographically. We also believe that, if we require additional space, we will be able to lease
additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms.
