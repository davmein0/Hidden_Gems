Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Form 10-K”) contains forward-looking statements regarding, among other things, our plans,
strategies and prospects, both business and financial. These statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Although
we believe that our plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by these forward-looking statements are reasonable,
we cannot provide assurance that we will achieve or realize these plans, intentions or expectations. Forward-looking statements are inherently
subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Generally, statements that are not historical facts, including statements concerning
possible or assumed future actions, business strategies, events or results of operations, are forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate,”
“believe,” “continue,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,”
“may,” “might,” “plan,” “possible,” “potential,” “predict,” “project,”
“should,” “would” and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words
does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Investors should read statements that contain these words carefully because they
discuss future expectations, contain projects of future results of operations or financial condition; or state other “forward-looking”
information. Forward-looking statements are based on information available as of the date of this Form 10-K and may involve significant
judgments and assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside our control. There
may be events in the future that management is not able to predict accurately or over which we have no control. We do not undertake any
obligation to update to otherwise correct any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect events or circumstances after the
date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events, inaccuracies that become apparent after the date hereof or
otherwise, except as may be required under applicable laws. The risk factors and cautionary language contained in this Form 10-K provide
examples of risks, uncertainties, and events that may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in such
forward-looking statements, including among other things:

●

our ability to grow and
    manage future growth profitably over time, maintain relationships with customers, compete within our industry and retain key employees;

●

the possibility that we
    may be adversely impacted by economic, business, and/or competitive factors;

●

our limited operating history
    makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects;

●

our recent and rapid growth
    may not be indicative of future performance;

●

we may not continue to
    grow or maintain our active user base, and may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability;

●

risks relating to our ability
    to attract new advertisers, or the potential loss of existing advertisers or the reduction of or failure by existing advertisers
    to maintain or increase their advertising budgets;

●

our cloud business may
    not achieve success, and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected;

●

negative media campaigns
    may adversely impact our financial performance, results of operations, and relationships with our business partners, including content
    creators and advertisers;

●

spam activity, including
    inauthentic and fraudulent user activity, if undetected, may contribute, from time to time, to some amount of overstatement
    of our performance indicators;

●

we collect, store, and
    process large amounts of user video content and personal information of our users and subscribers. If our security measures are breached,
    our sites and applications may be perceived as not being secure, traffic and advertisers may curtail or stop viewing our content
    or using our services, our business and operating results could be harmed, and we could face governmental investigations and legal
    claims from users and subscribers;

ii

●

our recently implemented
    Bitcoin treasury strategy exposes us to various risks associated with holding Bitcoin;

●

we may fail to comply with
    applicable privacy laws, subjecting us to liability and damages;

●

our cloud services business
    operates in a highly regulated environment, subject to a complex and rapidly evolving array of domestic and international laws, regulations,
    and industry standards governing data privacy, cybersecurity, data localization, and cross-border data transfers;

●

we are subject to cybersecurity
    risks and interruptions or failures in our information technology systems and as we grow and gain recognition, we will likely need
    to expend additional resources to enhance our protection from such risks. Notwithstanding our efforts, a cyber incident could occur
    and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss;

●

we may be found to have
    infringed on the intellectual property of others, which could expose us to substantial losses or restrict our operations;

●

we may face liability for
    hosting a variety of tortious or unlawful materials uploaded by third parties, notwithstanding the liability protections of Section
    230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (“Section 230”);

●

we may face negative publicity
    for removing, or declining to remove, certain content, regardless of whether such content violated any law;

●

paid endorsements by our
    content creators may expose us to regulatory risk, liability, and compliance costs, and, as a result, may adversely affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations;

●

our traffic growth, engagement,
    and monetization depend upon effective operation within and compatibility with operating systems, networks, devices, web browsers
    and standards, including mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control;

●

our business depends on
    continued and unimpeded access to our content and services on the internet. If we or those who engage with our content experience
    disruptions in internet service, or if internet service providers are able to block, degrade or charge for access to our content
    and services, we could incur additional expenses and the loss of traffic and advertisers;

●

we face significant market
    competition, and if we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors for traffic and advertising spend, our business and
    operating results could be harmed;

●

we
rely on data from third parties to calculate certain of our performance metrics. Real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm
our reputation and negatively affect our business;

●

changes to our existing
    content and services could fail to attract traffic and advertisers or fail to generate revenue;

iii

●

we derive the majority
    of our revenue from advertising. The failure to attract new advertisers, the loss of existing advertisers, or the reduction of or
    failure by existing advertisers to maintain or increase their advertising budgets would adversely affect our business;

●

we depend on third-party
    vendors, including internet service providers, advertising networks, and data centers, to provide core services;

●

hosting and delivery costs
    may increase unexpectedly;

●

we have offered and intend
    to continue to offer incentives, including economic incentives, to content creators to join our platform, and these arrangements
    may involve fixed payment obligations that are not contingent on actual revenue or performance metrics generated by the applicable
    content creator but rather are based on our modeled financial projections for that creator, which if not satisfied may adversely
    impact our financial performance, results of operations and liquidity;

●

we may be unable to develop
    or maintain effective internal controls;

●

we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. If we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations;

●

potential diversion of
    management’s attention and consumption of resources as a result of acquisitions of other companies and success in integrating
    and otherwise achieving the benefits of recent and potential acquisitions;

●

we may fail to maintain
    adequate operational and financial resources or raise additional capital or generate sufficient cash flows;

●

changes in tax rates, changes
    in tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce, the adoption of new tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities
    may adversely impact our financial results;

●

compliance obligations
    imposed by new privacy laws, laws regulating online video sharing platforms, other online platforms, and online speech in certain
    jurisdictions in which we operate, or industry practices may adversely affect our business; and

●

other risks and uncertainties
    indicated in this Form 10-K, including those under “
