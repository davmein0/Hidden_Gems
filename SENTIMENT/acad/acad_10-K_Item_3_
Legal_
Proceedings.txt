Item 3. 
Legal 
Proceedings.

Patent Infringement

On July 24, 2020, we filed complaints against (i) Aurobindo Pharma Limited and its affiliate Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. and (ii) Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. and its affiliate Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and on July 30, 2020, we filed complaints against (i) Hetero Labs Limited and its affiliates Hetero Labs Limited Unit-V and Hetero USA Inc., (ii) MSN Laboratories Private Ltd. and its affiliate MSN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and (iii) Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. and its affiliate Cadila Healthcare Limited. These complaints, which were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, allege infringement of certain of our Orange Book-listed patents covering NUPLAZID (Pimavanserin I Cases).

We entered into an agreement effective April 22, 2021 with Hetero settling all claims and counterclaims in the litigation. The agreement allows Hetero to launch its generic pimavanserin product on February 27, 2038, subject to certain triggers for earlier launch. The Hetero case was dismissed by joint agreement on May 3, 2021.

On September 30, 2022, we filed a stipulation and proposed order to stay the claims currently asserted against Teva and for Teva to be bound by the result of the litigation rendered against the remaining defendants Aurobindo and MSN, which was ordered by the Court on October 4, 2022.

On October 21, 2022, we filed additional complaints against Aurobindo, MSN and Zydus in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement of an additional Orange Book-listed patent covering NUPLAZID (Pimavanserin II Cases).

59

We entered into an agreement, effective March 31, 2023, with Zydus settling all claims and counterclaims in the Pimavanserin I Cases and Pimavanserin II Cases. The agreement allows Zydus to launch its generic pimavanserin 10 mg tablet products on September 23, 2036 and 34 mg capsule products on February 27, 2038, subject to certain triggers for earlier launch. The Zydus case was dismissed by joint agreement on April 5, 2023.

As a result of the above, only MSN remained as an active defendant in the Pimavanserin I Cases. On January 11, 2024, following summary judgment motions, the District Court entered final judgment in our favor that MSN’s submission of ANDA No. 214925 was an act of infringement in the Pimavanserin I Case and the ’740 patent was not invalid. On January 18, 2024, MSN filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit from the final judgment entered on January 11, 2024. The appeal is fully briefed and awaiting a date for oral argument.

In connection with the Pimavanserin II cases, MSN and Aurobindo are the remaining defendants. A bench trial was conducted from December 3, 2024 to December 6, 2024 in the matter. Post-trial briefing was completed on February 12, 2025 and we are awaiting the final decision of the Court.

On February 14, 2025, we filed a complaint against Zydus Lifesciences Limited, Zydus Worldwide DMCC, and Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. (collectively “Zydus”) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of certain of our Orange Book-listed patents covering NUPLAZID (Pimavanserin) by Zydus’ proposed 34 mg pimavanserin tablet product. Zydus has not responded to the complaint as of yet and there is no schedule in place for the case.

Securities Class Action

On April 19, 2021, a purported stockholder of us filed a putative securities class action complaint (captioned 
City of

Birmingham Relief Retirement Systems v. Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.
, Case No. 21-cv-0762) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against us and certain of our current executive officers. On September 29, 2021, the Court issued an order designating lead plaintiff and lead counsel. On December 10, 2021, lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint generally alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by failing to disclose that the materials submitted in support of its sNDA seeking approval of pimavanserin for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis contained statistical and design deficiencies and that the FDA was unlikely to approve the sNDA in its current form. The amended complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and other relief.  On March 11, 2024, the Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and appointment of class representatives and class counsel. The parties are currently engaged in expert discovery, which is scheduled to close on June 13, 2025.

Opt-Out Litigation

On March 7, 2024, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a complaint (captioned 
Alger Dynamic Opportunities Fund v. Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
, Case No. 24-cv-00451) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against us and one executive officer. The complaint is based on the same underlying allegations as the Securities Class Action described above, and alleged claims under federal and state securities laws, and for common law fraud and negligent misrepresentations. On May 24, 2024, Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. On October 31, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part Defendants’ motion to dismiss. The Court dismissed with leave to amend the purported stockholder’s state and common law claims, as well as the claim brought under Section 18(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Defendants filed their answer to the Sections 10(b) and 20(a) claims on December 16, 2024. On January 13, 2025, the Court stayed this suit pending the outcome of the Securities Class Action.

Derivative Suit

On December 15, 2023, a purported stockholder of us filed a derivative action (captioned 
Kanner et al v. Biggar et al.
, Case No. 23-cv-2293) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against certain of our current directors. We are named as a nominal defendant. The complaint is based on the same alleged misconduct as the Securities Class Action, and asserts state law claims, on behalf of us, against the individual defendants for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, waste of corporate assets, and insider trading. The complaint also asserts federal claims under sections 10(b), 21D, and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. On December 27, 2023, the action was reassigned to District Judge William Q. Hayes and Magistrate Judge Michael S. Berg due to its relation to the Securities Class Action. On January 30, 2024, the parties jointly requested a stay of the action. The Court granted that request and the action was stayed on February 20, 2024, pending the outcome of our Demand Review Committee’s investigation into the underlying claims.

60

We currently believe that none of the foregoing claims or other actions pending against us as of December 31, 2024 is likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position, or results of operations. Given the unpredictability inherent in litigation, however, we cannot predict the outcome of these matters. We are unable to estimate possible losses or ranges of losses that may result from these matters, and therefore we have not accrued any amounts in connection with these matters other than attorneys’ fees incurred to date.

Overview

Background

We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines that address unmet medical needs in CNS disorders and rare diseases.

We have two core franchises in neuroscience and neuro-rare diseases. Our neuroscience franchise is anchored by the commercial product NUPLAZID (pimavanserin), which is the first and only drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with PDP. Our neuro-rare disease franchise is anchored by the commercial product DAYBUE, which is the first and only drug approved for the treatment of Rett syndrome. Net product sales from these two commercial products totaled $957.8 million for 2024, compared with $726.4 million for 2023.

In August 2018, we acquired an exclusive North American license to develop and commercialize DAYBUE for Rett syndrome and other indications from Neuren. Rett syndrome is a debilitating neurological disorder that occurs predominantly in females following apparently normal development for the first six months of life. Rett syndrome also occurs in boys, albeit far less frequently. Typically, between six to eighteen months of age, patients experience a period of rapid decline with loss of purposeful hand use and spoken communication and inability to independently conduct activities of daily living. Symptoms also include seizures, hand movements or stereotypies, disorganized breathing patterns, scoliosis and sleep disturbances, among others. The FDA approval of DAYBUE for the treatment of Rett syndrome was based on the positive results from our pivotal Phase 3 LAVENDER
™
 study which demonstrated statistically significant improvement over placebo for both co-primary endpoints as well as the key secondary endpoint.

63

Under the terms of the 2018 agreement, Neuren received an upfront payment of $10.0 million and is eligible to receive milestone payments of up to $400.0 million based on the achievement of certain development and sales milestones for Rett syndrome in North America, of which, $50 million has been paid to date. Neuren is also eligible to receive up to $55.0 million in development and sales milestone for Fragile X syndrome in North America. In addition, Neuren is eligible to receive tiered, escalating, double-digit percentage royalties based on net sales in North America. The following tables provide a summary of milestone and royalty payments that Neuren remains eligible to receive based on the achievement of net sales of trofinetide in North America in any given year:

In July 2023, we expanded our current licensing agreement for trofinetide with Neuren to acquire rights to the drug outside of North America as well as global rights in Rett syndrome and Fragile X syndrome to Neuren’s development candidate NNZ-2591. Under the terms of the expanded agreement, Neuren received an upfront payment of $100.0 million and is eligible to receive up to an additional $426.3 million in milestone payments based on the achievement of certain commercial and sales milestones for trofinetide outside of North America and up to $831.3 million in milestone payments based on the achievement of certain development and sales milestones for NNZ-2591. In addition, we will be required to pay Neuren tiered royalties from the mid-teens to low-twenties percent based on net sales of trofinetide and NNZ-2591. The following table provides a summary of milestone payments that Neuren is eligible to receive based on the achievement of certain sales milestones under the terms of the expanded agreement:

Up to $83 million

In addition to these commercial products, we have a portfolio of product candidates and research programs that are designed to address significant unmet medical needs in CNS disorders and rare diseases. In order to achieve significant long-term growth, we plan to develop our current portfolio, expand our pipeline of early- and late-stage product candidates and expand into areas of rare disease that are adjacent to our existing franchises, including through strategic business development, and make use of our internal capabilities and knowledge.

Our most advanced product candidate is ACP-101 (intranasal carbetocin) for the treatment of hyperphagia in PWS, a neuro rare disease. Hyperphagia is an intense persistent sensation of hunger accompanied by food preoccupations, an extreme drive to consume food, food-related behavior problems, and a lack of normal satiety. In November 2023, we initiated the Phase 3 COMPASS PWS study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ACP-101 for the treatment of hyperphagia in PWS.

Our next most advanced product candidate is ACP-204 for the treatment of ADP. In November 2023, we initiated a Phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of ACP-204 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with ADP. We plan to initiate an additional Phase 2 study of ACP-204 in LBDP in the third quarter of 2025.

We have several product candidates in earlier stages of development for the treatment of CNS disorders and rare diseases, including ACP-711 for the treatment of essential tremor, for which we expect to initiate a Phase 2 study in 2026.

64

We have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception due in large part to expenditures for our research and development activities. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $2.2 billion. Contingent on the level of business development activities we may complete as well as pipeline programs we may advance, we may incur operating losses as we incur significant research and development costs and costs for continued commercialization of our products.

Financial Operations Overview

Product Revenues

Net product sales consist of sales of our products. The FDA approved NUPLAZID in April 2016 for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with PDP and we launched the product in the United States in May 2016. The FDA approved DAYBUE in March 2023 for the treatment of Rett syndrome and we launched the product in the United States in April 2023.

Cost of Product Sales

Cost of product sales consists of third-party manufacturing costs, freight, and indirect overhead costs associated with sales of our products. Cost of product sales may also include period costs related to certain inventory manufacturing services, excess or obsolete inventory adjustment charges, unabsorbed manufacturing and overhead costs, and manufacturing variances. In addition, cost of product sales may include license fees and royalties. License fees and royalties currently consist of milestone payments capitalized and subsequently amortized under our 2018 license agreement with Neuren. License fees and royalties also include royalties of tiered, escalating, double-digit percentages due to Neuren based upon net sales of DAYBUE.

Cost of sales for a newly launched product does not include the full cost of manufacturing until the initial pre-launch inventory is depleted, and additional inventory is manufactured and sold. Thus the cost of sales as a percentage of net sales of DAYBUE for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were affected by use of the initial pre-launch inventory, which was previously expensed as research and development expense, and is referred to as zero cost inventories. However, we do not expect that the cost of sales as a percentage of net sales of DAYBUE will increase significantly once we commence the sales of full cost inventories.

Research and Development Expenses

Our research and development expenses have consisted primarily of fees paid to external service providers, salaries and related personnel expenses, facilities and equipment expenses, and other costs incurred related to pre-commercial product candidates. We charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred. Our research and development activities have focused on pimavanserin, trofinetide, ACP-101, ACP-204 and other earlier-stage product candidates. In connection with the FDA approval of DAYBUE, we are required to conduct post-marketing work, including a clinical study of renal impairment in healthy volunteers, nonclinical carcinogenicity studies, and nonclinical in vitro and clinical in vivo drug interaction studies. The FDA has released us from one of the five PMRs. In addition, we have fulfilled one of the five PMRs. Of the remaining three PMRs, we have also completed one and we are awaiting the FDA’s acknowledgement and acceptance of that completed PMR. We will be responsible for all costs incurred for these PMRs. In addition, we expect to incur increased research and development expenses as a result of advancement of our early-stage product candidates.

We use external service providers to manufacture our product candidates and for the majority of the services performed in connection with the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. Historically, we have used our internal research and development resources, including our employees and discovery infrastructure, across several projects and many of our costs have not been attributable to a specific project. Accordingly, we have not reported our internal research and development costs on a project-by-project basis. To the extent that external expenses are not attributable to a specific project, they are allocated proportionally to each of the projects.

* Includes upfront and milestone consideration as well as transaction costs associated with acquired in-process research and development.

At this time, due to the risks inherent in regulatory requirements and clinical development, we are unable to estimate with certainty the costs we will incur to support the commercialization of DAYBUE, as well as the further development of our early-stage product candidates. Likewise, we are unable to determine with certainty the anticipated completion dates for our current research and development programs. Clinical development and regulatory approval timelines, probability of success, and development costs vary widely. While our current development efforts are primarily focused on advancing the development of ACP-101, ACP-204 and other early-stage product candidates, we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate, as well as an ongoing assessment of the commercial potential of each candidate and our financial position. We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which product candidates will be subject to future collaborative or licensing arrangements, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree any such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements. Similarly, we are unable to estimate with certainty the costs we will incur for post-marketing studies that we committed to conduct in connection with FDA approval of DAYBUE.

We expect our research and development expenses will continue to be substantial as we conduct studies pursuant to our PMRs and pursue the further development of ACP-101, ACP-204 and other early-stage product candidates. The lengthy process of completing clinical trials and supporting development activities and seeking regulatory approval for our product candidates requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us or delay in completing clinical trials, or in obtaining regulatory approvals, could cause our research and development expenses to increase and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for our commercial personnel, including our specialty sales forces, our medical education professionals, and our personnel serving in executive, finance, business development, and business operations functions. Also included in selling, general and administrative expenses are fees paid to external service providers to support our commercial activities associated with our products, professional fees associated with legal and accounting services, costs associated with patents and patent applications for our intellectual property and charitable donations to independent charitable foundations that support Parkinson’s disease patients generally. Changes in selling, general and administrative expenses in future periods are subject to the evolving PDP market dynamics and the Rett syndrome market.

Gain on Sale of Non-Financial Asset

Following the FDA approval of DAYBUE, we were granted a Rare Pediatric Disease PRV. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold the PRV to a third party for the aggregate net proceeds of $146.5 million.

66

Income Tax Expense

Because we maintain a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, income tax expense is expected to primarily consist of current federal and state tax expense as a result of taxable income anticipated or incurred in certain jurisdictions. Income tax expense may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to adjustments related to non-recurring transactions, timing of revenue and expense across different tax jurisdictions and changes in certain tax assessments.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

A summary of the significant accounting policies is provided in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions.

Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:

•
it requires a significant level of estimation uncertainty; and 

•
changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

We believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement.

Product Sales, Net

We sell NUPLAZID through SPs and SDs. SPs dispense product to a patient based on the fulfillment of a prescription and SDs sell product to government facilities, long-term care pharmacies, or in-patient hospital pharmacies. We sell DAYBUE through a single wholesale distributor. Product shipping and handling costs are included in cost of product sales.

We recognize revenue from product sales at the net sales price (the “transaction price”) which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and reflects each of these as either a reduction to the related account receivable or as an accrued liability, depending on how the amount payable is settled. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from estimates, we may need to adjust our estimates, which would affect net revenue in the period of adjustment. The following sales discounts and allowances involve a substantial degree of judgment:

Rebates
: Allowances for rebates include mandated discounts under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. Rebates are amounts owed after the final dispensing of the product to a benefit plan participant and are based upon contractual agreements with, or statutory requirements pertaining to, Medicaid and Medicare benefit providers. The allowance for rebates is based on statutory discount rates and expected utilization. Our estimates for expected utilization of rebates is based on historical data received from the SPs, SDs and the single wholesale distributor since product launch. Rebates are generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter’s activity, plus an accrual balance for prior quarters’ unpaid rebates still estimated to be incurred. Allowances for rebates also include amounts due under the Inflation Reduction act of 2022 for Medicare Part D unit sales with applicable period AMP increases that outpace inflation over the benchmark period. The applicable period will be twelve months on October 1 of each year, with the initial applicable period beginning on October 1, 2022. The benchmark period AMP price is January 1, 2021 through September 30, 2021. Our estimates are based Medicare Part D sales as a percentage of gross sales and the rate AMP for the current period will be in excess the benchmark period. We regularly monitor our estimates and record adjustments when rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events indicate that a change in the estimates is appropriate. To date, our estimates have not differed materially from actual rebates. However, subsequent changes in estimates may result in a material change in our accruals, which could also materially affect our balance sheet and results of operations.

67

Chargebacks
: Chargebacks are discounts and fees that relate to contracts with government and other entities purchasing from the SDs at a discounted price. The SDs charge back to us the difference between the price initially paid by the SDs and the discounted price paid to the SDs by these entities. We also incur group purchasing organization fees for transactions through certain purchasing organizations. We estimate sales with these entities and accrue for anticipated chargebacks and organization fees, based on the applicable contractual terms. To date, our estimates have not differed materially from the actual chargebacks and organization fees. However, subsequent changes in estimates may result in a material change in our accruals, which could also materially affect our balance sheet and results of operations.

Research and Development Accruals

We estimate certain costs and expenses and accrue for these liabilities as part of our process of preparing financial statements. Examples of areas in which subjective judgments may be required include, among other things, costs associated with services provided by contract organizations for preclinical development, manufacturing of our product candidates and clinical trials, and personnel related expenses. We accrue for costs incurred as the services are being provided by monitoring the status of the trial or services provided, and the invoices received from our external service providers. In the case of clinical trials, a portion of the estimated cost normally relates to the projected cost to treat a patient in the trials, and this cost is recognized based on the number of patients enrolled in the trial. Other indirect costs are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of the study. As actual costs become known to us, we adjust our accruals. To date, our estimates have not differed materially from the actual costs incurred. However, subsequent changes in estimates may result in a material change in our accruals, which could also materially affect our balance sheet and results of operations.

Stock-Based Compensation

The fair value of each employee stock option and each employee stock purchase plan right granted is estimated on the grant date under the fair value method using the Black-Scholes valuation model, which requires us to make a number of assumptions including the estimated expected life of the award and related volatility. The fair value of restricted stock units is estimated based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. The estimated fair values of stock options, purchase plan rights, and regular restricted stock units are then expensed over the vesting period. For restricted stock units requiring satisfaction of both market and service conditions, the estimated fair values are generally expensed over the longest of the explicit, implicit and derived service periods. The fair value of performance-based stock awards (PSUs) that vest upon the achievement of certain pre-defined company-specific performance-based criteria is estimated based on the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. Expense related to these PSUs is recognized ratably over the expected performance period once the pre-defined performance-based criteria for vesting becomes probable and can vest up to 200 percent of the target number of shares granted. Beginning in 2024, the structure of the PSU design was revised with a relative total shareholder return (rTSR) approach such that awards are earned for our rTSR performance over three-year measurement periods relative to a peer group of companies and the actual numbers of PSUs that will vest at the end of the performance period may be anywhere from zero to 150 percent of the target number of shares granted. The fair value of these PSUs is estimated using a Monte Carlo model. Expense related to these PSUs is recognized ratably over the three-year measurement period. See also Item 15 of Part IV, “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for further discussion of our assumptions and estimates related to our stock-based compensation.

Results of Operations

Fluctuations in Operating Results

Our results of operations have fluctuated significantly from period to period in the past and are likely to continue to do so in the future. We anticipate that our quarterly and annual results of operations will be impacted for the foreseeable future by several factors, including the progress and timing of expenditures related to our commercial activities associated with our products and the extent to which we generate revenue from product sales, our development of pimavanserin for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, our further development of our early-stage product candidates and the progress and timing of expenditures related to studies of DAYBUE pursuant to our PMRs. Further, we expect our sales allowances to vary from quarter to quarter due to fluctuations in our Medicare Part D Coverage Gap liability and the volume of purchases eligible for government mandated discounts and rebates, as well as changes in discount percentages that may be impacted by potential future price increases and other factors. We cannot predict with certainty what the full impact that geopolitical and macroeconomic developments, including the ongoing military conflict between Ukraine and Russia and in the Middle East, and tariffs and trade tensions may have on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Due to these fluctuations, we believe that the period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance.

Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023

Product Sales, Net

Net product sales, comprised of our products, were $957.8 million and $726.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Net product sales of NUPLAZID were $609.4 million and $549.2 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net product sales of NUPLAZID of $60.2 million was due to the growth in NUPLAZID unit sales as well as a higher average net selling price in NUPLAZID in 2024 compared to 2023. Net product sales of DAYBUE were $348.4 million and $177.2 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in net product sales of DAYBUE of $171.2 million was mainly due to the growth in DAYBUE unit sales in 2024 compared to 2023.

Cost of Product Sales

Cost of product sales was $81.8 million and $41.6 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, or approximately 9% and 6% of net product sales, respectively. Cost of product sales as a percentage of net product sales for NUPLAZID remained flat in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase in cost of product sales was primarily due to the $51.8 million in license fees and royalties expensed during 2024 as compared to $21.8 million in the same period of 2023 for DAYBUE, including royalties due to Neuren based on net sales of DAYBUE and the amortization of the milestone payments capitalized under our 2018 license agreement with Neuren.

Certain manufacturing related expenses incurred prior to DAYBUE receiving FDA approval were classified as research and development expenses, resulting in zero cost inventory. Prior to receiving FDA approval for DAYBUE in March 2023, we manufactured inventory and recorded approximately $29.9 million related to the zero cost inventory as research and development expense. Utilizing the actual direct costs to manufacture DAYBUE prior to receiving FDA approval, had the previously expensed inventory been capitalized and recognized when sold, the total cost of sales with these manufacturing costs included for the year ended December 31, 2024 would have increased by approximately $14.9 million. We do not expect our cost of product sales for DAYBUE to increase significantly as a percentage of net product sales in future periods as we continue to produce inventory for future sales. We expect to finish selling the zero cost inventories of DAYBUE in 2025.

Subsequent to using our entire zero cost inventories, we estimate our overall cost of product sales as a percentage of total net product sales will be in the range of a mid-single digit to high single digit percentage.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses decreased to $303.2 million in 2024, including $14.1 million in stock-based compensation, from $351.6 million in 2023, including $17.4 million in stock-based compensation. The decrease in research and development expenses during 2024 was due to decreased business development payments, which in the period ending December 31, 2023 included the $100.0 million payment to Neuren under the expanded license agreement for trofinetide, partially offset by increased costs from clinical stage programs.

69

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $488.4 million in 2024, including $51.6 million in stock-based compensation expense, from $406.6 million in 2023, including $48.0 million in stock-based compensation expense. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by increased marketing costs to support the NUPLAZID and DAYBUE franchises in the U.S. and investments to support commercialization of DAYBUE outside the U.S.

Gain on Sale of Non-Financial Asset

Following the FDA approval of DAYBUE, we were granted a Rare Pediatric Disease PRV. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold the PRV to a third party for the aggregate net proceeds of $146.5 million. No other non-financial asset sale happened during the year ended December 31, 2023.

Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2023 and 2022

Product Sales, Net

Product sales, net, comprised of NUPLAZID, were $726.4 million and $517.2 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Net product sales of NUPLAZID were $549.2 million and $517.2 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in net product sales of NUPLAZID of $32.0 million was due to the growth in NUPLAZID unit sales as well as a higher average net selling price in NUPLAZID in 2023 compared to 2022. Net product sales of DAYBUE were $177.2 million for 2023. There were no net product sales of DAYBUE during 2022.

Cost of Product Sales

Cost of product sales was $41.6 million and $10.2 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, or approximately 6% and 2% of net product sales, respectively. Cost of product sales as a percentage of net product sales for NUPLAZID remained flat in 2023 as compared to 2022. The increase in cost of product sales was primarily due to the $21.8 million in license fees and royalties expensed during 2023 for DAYBUE, including royalties due to Neuren based on net sales of DAYBUE and the amortization of the milestone payments capitalized under our 2018 license agreement with Neuren. There were no license fees and royalties in the same period of 2022 for either product.

Certain manufacturing related expenses incurred prior to DAYBUE receiving FDA approval were classified as research and development expenses, resulting in zero cost inventory. Prior to receiving FDA approval for DAYBUE in March 2023, we manufactured inventory and recorded approximately $29.9 million related to the zero cost inventory as research and development expense. Utilizing the actual direct costs to manufacture DAYBUE prior to receiving FDA approval, had the previously expensed inventory been capitalized and recognized when sold, the total cost of sales with these manufacturing costs included for the year ended December 31, 2023 would have increased by approximately $9.4 million. We do not expect our cost of product sales for DAYBUE to increase significantly as a percentage of net product sales in future periods as we continue to produce inventory for future sales.

Subsequent to using our entire zero cost inventories, we estimate our overall cost of product sales as a percentage of total net product sales will be in the range of a mid-single digit to high single digit percentage.

Research and Development Expenses

Research and development expenses decreased to $351.6 million in 2023, including $17.4 million in stock-based compensation expense, from $361.6 million in 2022, including $22.6 million in stock-based compensation expense. The decrease in research and development expenses during 2023 was mainly due to trofinetide commercial supply build that was expensed prior to approval. There was a similar level of clinical spend and business development investment year over year.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $406.6 million in 2023, including $48.0 million in stock-based compensation expense, from $369.1 million in 2022, including $44.4 million in stock-based compensation expense. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased commercial costs associated with the DAYBUE launch, partially offset by reductions in expenses associated with NUPLAZID.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We have funded our operations primarily with revenues from sales of our products since their approvals, and through sales of our equity securities and interest income. We anticipate that the level of cash used in our operations will fluctuate in future periods depending on the levels of spending required for our ongoing and planned commercial activities for our products, our ongoing and planned development activities for pimavanserin for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, ACP-101 as a treatment for PWS and ACP-204 as a treatment for ADP, studies to be conducted pursuant to our PMRs, our ongoing and planned development activities for other early- and late-stage product candidates and strategic business development to further expand our portfolio. We expect that our cash, cash equivalents and investment securities, as well as funds generated by anticipated sales of our products, will be sufficient to fund our planned operations through and beyond the next 12 months.

We may require additional financing in the future to fund our operations. Our future capital requirements will depend on, and could increase significantly as a result of, many factors, including:

•
the costs of acquiring additional product candidates or research and development programs;

•
the scope, prioritization and number of our research and development programs;

•
the ability of our collaborators and us to reach the milestones and other events or developments triggering payments under our collaboration or license agreements, or our collaborators’ ability to make payments under these agreements;

•
our ability to enter into new collaboration and license agreements;

•
the progress in, and the costs of, our ongoing and planned development activities for pimavanserin, post-marketing studies for DAYBUE to be conducted over the next several years, and ongoing and planned commercial activities for our products;

•
the costs of our development activities for our product candidates;

•
the costs of commercializing our products, including the maintenance and development of our sales and marketing capabilities; 

•
the costs of establishing, or contracting for, sales and marketing capabilities for our product candidates;

•
the amount of U.S. product sales from our products; 

•
the costs of preparing applications for regulatory approvals for DAYBUE in jurisdictions other than the U.S., for NUPLAZID in additional indications other than PDP and for other product candidates, as well as the costs required to support review of such applications;

•
the costs of manufacturing and distributing our products for commercial use in the U.S.;

•
our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, and subsequently generate product sales from, NUPLAZID for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, or from DAYBUE, and our product candidates;

•
the extent to which we are obligated to reimburse collaborators or collaborators are obligated to reimburse us for costs under collaboration agreements;

71

•
the costs involved in filing, prosecuting, enforcing, and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights;

•
the costs of maintaining or securing manufacturing arrangements for clinical or commercial production of pimavanserin, trofinetide or other product candidates; and

•
the costs associated with litigation, including the costs incurred in defending against any product liability claims that may be brought against us related to our products.

In the past, periods of turmoil and volatility in the financial markets have adversely affected the market capitalizations of many biotechnology companies, and generally made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain. For example, due to geopolitical and macroeconomic developments, including the Ukraine-Russia military conflict and related sanctions, the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, tariffs and trade tensions, the global credit and financial markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruptions, including diminished liquidity and credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates and uncertainty about economic stability. These events, coupled with other factors, may limit our access to additional financing in the future. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available when needed, we will be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts. We also may be required to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose. Additional funding, if obtained, may significantly dilute existing stockholders and could negatively impact the price of our stock.

We have invested a substantial portion of our available cash in money market funds, municipal bonds, and government sponsored enterprises in accordance with our investment policy. Our investment policy defines allowable investments and establishes guidelines relating to credit quality, diversification, and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity. All investment securities have a credit rating of at least Aa3/AA- or better, or P-1/A-1 or better, as determined by Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s. Our investment portfolio has not been adversely impacted by the disruptions in the credit markets that have occurred in the past. However, if there are future disruptions in the credit markets, there can be no assurance that our investment portfolio will not be adversely affected.

Material Cash Requirements

Our material cash requirements in the short and long term consist of the operational, manufacturing, and capital expenditures, a portion of which contain contractual or other obligations. We plan to fund our material cash requirements with our current financial resources together with our anticipated receipts from product sales. On a long-term basis, we manage future cash requirements relative to our long-term business plans.

Our primary uses of cash and operating expenses relate to paying employees and consultants, administering clinical trials, marketing our products, and providing technology and facility infrastructure to support our operations. We also make investments in our office and laboratory facilities to enable continued expansion of our business.

As of December 31, 2024 we have long-term contractual obligations related to our operating leases of $59.4 million. In May 2023, we subleased our 2
nd
 floor of corporate office space in San Diego with a total minimum sublease income of $18.4 million. In addition to operating leases, we enter into certain other long-term commitments for goods and services that are outstanding for periods greater than one year. We also enter into short-term agreements with various vendors and suppliers of goods and services in the normal course of operations through purchase orders or other documentation, or that are undocumented except for an invoice. Such short-term agreements are generally outstanding for periods less than a year and are settled by cash payments upon delivery of goods and services. The nature of the work being conducted under these agreements is such that, in most cases, the services may be stopped on short notice. In such event, we would not be liable for the full amount of the agreement.

72

We have entered into various collaboration, licensing and merger agreements which generally include upfront license fees, development and commercial milestone payments upon achievement of certain clinical and commercial development and annual net sales milestones, as well as royalties calculated as a percentage of net product sales, with rates that vary by agreement. As of December 31, 2024, we may be required to make milestone payments up to $4.0 billion in the aggregate. $1.1 billion payments are contingent upon achieving future development and regulatory milestones, and $2.9 billion payments are contingent upon achieving future commercial milestones. Of the total $4.0 billion milestone payments, we are required to make milestone payments of $50.0 million within 60 days following Neuren’s invoice delivery after December 31, 2024 as our aggregate net revenue of trofinetide in North America for the treatment of Rett syndrome exceeded $250.0 million in 2024. We also paid Neuren $48.8 million for one third of the net proceeds from sale of PRV in February 2025.

We expect to receive our first invoice for rebates under the IRA from Medicare Part D unit sales in 2025. Payment is due 30 days after receiving such invoice; the payment will be set off against the allowance for such rebate that we have accrued up to the date of payment.

Cash Flows

At December 31, 2024, we had $756.0 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities, compared to $438.9 million at December 31, 2023. This $317.1 million increase in cash, cash equivalents, and investment securities during 2024 was primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities, including the sale of the PRV.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $157.7 million in 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $16.7 million in 2023 and net cash used in operating activities of $114.0 million in 2022. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2024 relative to 2023 was primarily due to an increase in our net revenues, decreased research and development costs and proceeds from sale of a non-financial asset
, partially offset by increased sales and marketing costs
. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2023 relative to 2022 was primarily due to an increase in our net revenues and decreased research and development costs
, partially offset by increased sales and marketing costs
.

Net cash used in investing activities totaled $30.5 million in 2024 compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $32.0 million in 2023 and net cash provided by investing activities of $73.2 million in 2022. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to increased net purchases of investment securities. The decrease in net cash provided by investing activities in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to milestone payment of $40 million to Neuren and decreased net sale and maturities of investment securities.

Net cash provided by financing activities decreased to $6.8 million in 2024 compared to $25.1 million in 2023 and $8.2 million in 2022. This decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2024 relative to 2023 was attributable primarily to a decrease in proceeds resulting from the exercise of employee stock options. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2023 relative to 2022 was primarily due to an increase in proceeds resulting from the exercise of employee stock options.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

To date, we have not had any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships.

Item 7A. 
Quantitative and Qualitat
ive Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

We invest our excess cash in investment-grade, interest-bearing securities. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and liquidity. To achieve this objective, we invest in money market funds. U.S. treasury notes, and high quality marketable debt instruments of corporations and government sponsored enterprises with contractual maturity dates of generally less than one year. All investment securities have a credit rating of at least Aa3/AA- or better, or P-1/A-1 or better, as determined by Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s. We do not have any direct investments in auction-rate securities or securities that are collateralized by assets that include mortgages or subprime debt. If a 10 percent change in interest rates were to have occurred on December 31, 2024 and 2023, this change would not have had a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio as of that date. Due to our investment in investment-grade, interest-bearing securities, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not expect anticipated changes in interest rates to have a material effect on our interest rate risk in future reporting periods.

Controls
 and Procedures.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

As of December 31, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision and with the participation of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

74

As of December 31, 2024, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report, which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

An evaluation was also performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of any changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter and that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. That evaluation did not identify any change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our latest fiscal quarter and that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of

Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria).  In our opinion, Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Regist
ered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of

Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and stockholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control
—
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 27, 2025
 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Medicare Part D sales rebate accruals

Description of the Matter

As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “Revenue Recognition” the Company establishes provisions for sales rebates and discounts in the same period as the related sales occur. Estimated sales rebates for the purchase of NUPLAZID covered by Medicare Part D are included within accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. In order to establish these sales rebate accruals, the Company estimated its rebates based upon the identification of the product subject to a rebate, the historical and expected payor mix, the applicable price, rebate terms and the estimated lag time between the sale and payment of the rebate.
Auditing the Medicare Part D sales rebate is complex because of the subjectivity of certain assumptions required to estimate the rebate liabilities and the amounts involved are material to the financial statements taken as a whole. In calculating the appropriate accrual amount, the Company considered historical Medicare Part D rebate payments as well as any significant changes in sales trends, the lag in payment timing, an evaluation of the current Medicare Part D laws and interpretations, the percentage of products that are sold via Medicare Part D, and product pricing. In deriving these estimates and assumptions, the Company used both internal and external sources of information to estimate product in the distribution channels, payor mix, prescription volumes and historical experience. Management supplemented its historical data analysis with qualitative adjustments based upon changes in rebate trends, rebate programs and contract terms, legislative changes, or other significant events which indicate a change in the reserve is appropriate.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s sales rebate accruals for Medicare Part D rebates. This included testing controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions described above and inputs into the rebate calculations. For example, we tested controls over actual sales and the accuracy of forecasting expected utilization and payor mix. The testing was inclusive of management’s controls to evaluate the accuracy of its reserve judgments to actual rebates paid, rebate validation and processing, and controls to ensure that the data used to evaluate and support the significant assumptions was complete, accurate and, where applicable, verified to external data sources.

To test the sales rebate accruals for Medicare Part D, our audit procedures included, among others, understanding and evaluating the significant assumptions

and underlying data

used in management’s calculations. Our testing of significant assumptions included a lookback analysis to evaluate the historical accuracy of management’s estimates by comparing actual rebates to previous estimates and performed sensitivity analyses over the subjective assumptions to evaluate the completeness of the reserves. As a part of our procedures, we evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s assumptions considering recent sales trends and regulatory factors.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Organization and Business
Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. (the Company), based in San Diego, California, is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines to address unmet medical needs in central nervous system disorders and rare diseases.

In April 2016, the FDA approved the Company’s first drug, NUPLAZID
®
 (pimavanserin), for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with PDP. NUPLAZID became available for prescription in the United States in May 2016.
In March 2023, the FDA approved the Company’s second drug, DAYBUE™ (trofinetide), for the treatment of Rett syndrome. DAYBUE became available for prescription in the United States in April 2023.

In October 2024, Health Canada granted marketing authorization of DAYBUE™ (trofinetide) for the treatment of Rett syndrome in adult and pediatric patients 2 years of age and older.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of these financial statements are as follows:
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity date at the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported in the consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):

ACADIA PHARMACEUTICALS INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Investment Securities
Currently, all of the Company’s investment securities are debt securities. The Company has classified all of its investment securities as available-for-sale as the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity to implement management strategies, and accordingly, carries these investments at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses, if any, are reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. The cost of investment securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion are included in interest income. Realized gains and losses, if any, are also included in interest income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying values of the Company’s financial instruments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, interest and other receivables, restricted cash, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value due to the relative short-term nature of these instruments.

As disclosed in Note 4, the Company classifies its cash equivalents and available-for-sale investment securities within the fair value hierarchy as defined by authoritative guidance:

Level 1 Inputs
 — Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.

Level 2 Inputs
 — Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable.

Level 3 Inputs
 — Valuation derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are recorded net of customer allowances for distribution fees, prompt payment discounts, chargebacks, and credit losses. Allowances for distribution fees, prompt payment discounts and chargebacks are based on contractual terms. The Company estimated the current expected credit losses of its accounts receivable by assessing the risk of loss and available relevant information about the collectability, including historical credit losses, existing contractual payment terms, actual payment patterns of its customers, individual customer circumstances, and reasonable and supportable forecast of economic conditions expected to exist throughout the contractual life of the receivable. Based on its assessment, as of December 31, 2024
 and 2023, the Company has determined that an allowance for credit loss was not required.
Inventory

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value under the first-in, first-out method (FIFO). The Company uses a combination of standard and actual costing methodologies to determine the cost basis for its inventories which approximates actual costs. Inventory consists of raw material, work in process, and finished goods, including third-party manufacturing costs, freight, and indirect overhead costs. The Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with its products upon regulatory approval when, based on management’s judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized; otherwise, such costs are expensed. Prior to FDA approval of NUPLAZID in April 2016 and DAYBUE and March 2023, all costs related to the manufacturing of NUPLAZID and DAYBUE were charged to research and development expense in the period incurred.

The Company periodically reviews inventory and reduces the carrying value of items to net realizable value for potentially excess, dated or obsolete inventory based on an analysis of forecasted demand compared to quantities on hand and any firm purchase orders, as well as product shelf life. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded charges of $
0.5
 million, 
$
0.9
 million and $
0.6
 million, 
respectively, to reduce certain finished goods and work in process inventory to its net realizable value.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the lease by use of the straight-line method. Construction-in-process reflects amounts incurred for property, equipment or improvements that have not been placed in service. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred. When assets are retired or sold, the assets and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any gain or loss is recognized. Estimated useful lives by major asset category are as follows:

Useful Lives

Machinery and equipment

5
 to 
7 years

Computers and software

3
 years

Furniture and fixtures

10
 years

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Through December 31, 2024,

no
 suc
h impairment losses have been recorded by the Company.
License Fees and Royalties
The Company expenses amounts paid to acquire licenses associated with products under development when the ultimate recoverability of the amounts paid is uncertain and the technology has no alternative future use when acquired. Acquisitions of technology licenses are charged to expense or capitalized based upon management’s assessment regarding the ultimate recoverability of the amounts paid and the potential for alternative future use. The Company has determined that technological feasibility for its product candidates is reached when the requisite regulatory approvals are obtained to make the product available for sale.

Pursuant to the license agreement with Neuren, the Company has capitalized a t
otal of $
138.8
 million as
 intangible assets following the FDA approval and sale of DAYBUE and sale of PRV, as disclosed in Note 9. The intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the licensed patents through early 2036. The Company recorded total amortization expense related to these intangible assets of 
$
15.0
 million and $
4.1
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of 
December 31, 2024, estimated future amortization expense related to the Company’s intangible assets was 
$
10.9
 million for each subsequent year.
Royalties incurred in connection with the Company’s license agreement with Neuren, as disclosed in Note 9, are expensed to cost of product sales as revenue from product sales is recognized
.
Intangible Assets
Finite-lived intangible assets are recorded at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and, if applicable, impairment charges. Amortization of finite-lived intangible assets is recorded over the assets’ estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis or based on the pattern in which economic benefits are consumed, if reliably determinable. We review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured 
by the amount by which the carrying amount of intangible the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the intangible assets. 
No
 impairment loss was recorded on intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 
2024 or 2023
.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Acquisitions
The Company accounts for acquisitions of an asset or group of similar identifiable assets that do not meet the definition of a business as asset acquisition using the cost accumulation method, whereby the cost of the acquisition, including certain transaction costs, is allocated to the assets acquired on the basis of their relative fair values. No goodwill is recognized in an asset acquisition. Intangible assets acquired in an asset acquisition for use in research and development activities which have no alternative future use are expensed as in-process research and development on the acquisition date. Intangible assets acquired for use in research and development activities which have an alternative future use are capitalized as in-process research and development. Future costs to develop these assets are recorded to research and development expense as they are incurred. Contingent milestone payments associated with asset acquisitions are recognized when probable and estimable. These amounts are expensed to research and development if there is no alternative future use associated with the asset, or capitalized as an intangible asset if alternative future use of the asset exists.
Advertising Expense
Advertising costs are expensed when services are performed or goods are delivered. The Company incurred 
$
21.1
 million, $
9.4
 million and $
5.5
 mil
lion in advertising costs during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, respectively and $
1.3
 million of advertising costs were capitalized as prepaid expenses at December 31, 2024. 
No
 advertising costs were capitalized as prepaid expenses at December 31, 2023 or 2022.
Revenue Recognition
The Company operates in one business segment. Results of its operations are reported on a consolidated basis for purposes of s
egment reporting, consistent with internal management reporting. Revenues consist of net product sales to customers, all of which are sales in the U.S. Revenues by product are as follows (in thousands):

Product Sales, Net
The Company accounts for contracts with its customers in accordance with 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
. The Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services which is generally upon delivery. Revenues reflect the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that the Company determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract, determines those that are performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. Payment terms differ by customer, but typically range from 31 to 35 days from the date of shipment. Revenue for the Company’s product sales has not been adjusted for the effects of a financing component as the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the Company transfers control of the product and when the Company receives payment will be one year or less.
The Company’s product sales, net consist of U.S. sales of NUPLAZID and DAYBUE. NUPLAZID was approved by the FDA in April 2016 and the Company commenced shipments of NUPLAZID to SPs and SDs in late May 2016. SPs dispense product to a patient based on the fulfillment of a prescription and SDs sell product to government facilities, long-term care pharmacies, or in-patient hospital pharmacies. DAYBUE was approved by the FDA in March 2023 and the Company commenced shipments of DAYBUE to a single wholesale distributor in April 2023. Product shipping and handling costs are included in cost of product sales.

The Company recognizes revenue from product sales at the net sales price (the “transaction price”) which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves for sales discounts and allowance are established and reflects each of these as either a reduction to the related account receivable or as an accrued liability, depending on how the amount payable is settled. Overall, these reserves reflect the Company’s best estimates of the amount of consideration to which the Company is entitled based on the terms of the contract. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained, and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from the Company’s estimates. If actual results in the future vary from estimates, the Company may need to adjust its estimates, which would affect net revenue in the period of adjustment. The following are the Company’s significant categories of sales discounts and allowances:
Distribution Fees
: Distribution fees include distribution service fees paid to the SPs, SDs and wholesale distributor based on a contractually fixed percentage of the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC), fees for data, and prompt payment discounts. Distribution fees are recorded as an offset to revenue based on contractual terms at the time revenue from the sale is recognized.
Rebates
: Allowances for rebates include mandated discounts under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. Rebates are amounts owed after the final dispensing of the product to a benefit plan participant and are based upon contractual agreements with, or statutory requirements pertaining to, Medicaid and Medicare benefit providers. The allowance for rebates is based on statutory discount rates, estimated payor mix, and expected utilization. The Company’s estimates for expected utilization of rebates are based on historical data received from the SPs, SDs and single wholesale distributor since product launch. Rebates are generally invoiced and paid in arrears so that the accrual balance consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter’s activity, plus an accrual balance for prior quarters’ unpaid rebates still estimated to be incurred. Allowances for rebates also include amounts due under the Inflation Reduction act of 2022 for Medicare Part D unit sales with applicable period AMP increases that outpace inflation over the benchmark period. The applicable period will be twelve months on October 1 of each year, with the initial applicable period beginning on October 1, 2022. The benchmark period AMP price is January 1, 2021 through September 30, 2021 for NUPLAZID and January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024 for DAYBUE. The Company’s estimates are based Medicare Part D sales as a percentage of gross sales and the rate AMP for the current period will be in excess the benchmark period.

Chargebacks
: Chargebacks are discounts and fees that relate to contracts with government and other entities purchasing from the SDs at a discounted price. The SDs charge back to the Company the difference between the price initially paid by the SDs and the discounted price paid to the SDs by these entities. The Company also incurs group purchasing organization fees for transactions through certain purchasing organizations. The Company estimates sales with these entities and accrues for anticipated chargebacks and organization fees, based on the applicable contractual terms.
Co-Payment Assistance
: The Company offers co-payment assistance to commercially insured patients meeting certain eligibility requirements. Co-payment assistance is accrued for based on actual program participation and estimates of program redemption using data provided by third-party administrators.
Product Returns
: Consistent with industry practice, the Company offers the SPs and SDs limited product return rights for damages, shipment errors, and expiring product; provided that the return is within a specified period around the product expiration date as set forth in the applicable individual distribution agreement. The Company does not allow product returns for product that has been dispensed to a patient. As the Company receives inventory reports from the SPs and SDs and has the ability to control the amount of product that is sold to the SPs and SDs, it is able to make a reasonable estimate of future potential product returns based on this on-hand channel inventory data and sell-through data obtained from the SPs and SDs. In arriving at its estimate for product returns, the Company also considers historical product returns, the underlying product demand, and industry data specific to the specialty pharmaceutical distribution industry.

Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Research and development expenses include costs associated with services provided by contract organizations for preclinical development, pre-commercialization manufacturing expenses, and clinical trials, salaries and related personnel expenses including stock-based compensation expense, and facilities and equipment expenses. The upfront consideration and transaction costs associated with acquired in-process research and development are also included in the research and development expenses.

F-

ACADIA PHARMACEUTICALS INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The Company accrues for costs incurred as the services are being provided by monitoring the status of the trial or services provided and the invoices received from its external service providers. When the Company makes payments in advance of services being provided, it records those amounts as prepaid expenses on its consolidated balance sheets and expense them as the services are rendered. In the case of clinical trials, a portion of the estimated cost normally relates to the projected cost to treat a patient in the trials, and this cost is recognized based on the number of patients enrolled in the trial. Other indirect costs are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of the study. As actual costs become known, the Company adjusts its accruals accordingly.

Concentration Risk
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, principally consist of cash, cash equivalents, investment securities, accounts receivable, and restricted cash. The Company invests its excess cash primarily in money market funds, U.S. treasury notes, and high quality, marketable debt instruments of corporations and government sponsored enterprises in accordance with the Company’s investment policy. The Company’s investment policy defines allowable investments and establishes guidelines relating to credit quality, diversification, and maturities of its investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity. All investment securities have a credit rating of at least Aa3/AA- or better, or P-1/A-1 or better, as determined by Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s. Further, the Company specifies credit quality standards for its customers that are designed to limit the Company’s credit exposure to any single party.
The Company does not currently have any of its own manufacturing facilities, and therefore it depends on an outsourced manufacturing strategy for the production of NUPLAZID and DAYBUE for commercial use and for the production of its product candidates for clinical trials. For the production of NUPLAZID, the Company has contracts in place with two third-party manufacturers of commercial drug product and one third-party manufacturer of drug substance that is approved for the production of NUPLAZID API. For the production of DAYBUE, the Company has contracts in place with two third-party manufacturers of commercial drug product and two third-party manufacturers of drug substance that is approved for the production of DAYBUE API. Although there are potential sources of supply other than the Company’s existing suppliers, any new supplier would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements.
The Company has entered into agreements for the distribution of NUPLAZID with a limited number of SPs and SDs, and all of the Company’s product sales of NUPLAZID are to these customers. The Company has also entered into agreements for the distribution of DAYBUE with a single wholesale distributor, and all of the Company’s product sales of DAYBUE and accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2024
 are related to this customer.

Stock-Based Compensation
We measure stock-based compensation expense for equity-classified awards, principally related to stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), PSUs and stock purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant.

The fair value of each employee stock option and each employee stock purchase right granted is estimated on the grant date under the fair value method using the Black-Scholes valuation model. 
The estimated fair value of each stock option and purchase right is then expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The following weighted-average assumptions were used during these periods:

Expected Volatility.
 The Company considers its historical volatility and implied volatility when determining the expected volatility.
Risk-Free Interest Rate.
 The Company determines its risk-free interest rate assumption based on the U.S. Treasury yield for obligations with contractual terms similar to the expected term of the stock option or purchase right being valued.
Expected Dividend Yield.
 The Company has never paid any dividends and currently has no plans to do so.
Expected Life.
 In determining the expected life for stock options, the Company considers, among other factors, its historical exercise experience to date as well as the mean time remaining to full vesting of all outstanding options and the mean time remaining to the end of the contractual term of all outstanding options. The estimated life for the Company’s employee stock purchase rights is based upon the terms of each offering period.
Forfeitures.
 The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur.
The fair value of RSUs is estimated based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. RSUs generally vest over a four-year period. Certain RSUs also have an accelerated vesting clause based on specified market condition target and continued employment through a minimum vesting period. The fair value of RSUs expected to vest are recognized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. For those RSUs requiring satisfaction of both market and service conditions, the requisite service period is the longest of the explicit, implicit and derived service periods.

F-

ACADIA PHARMACEUTICALS INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Through 2023, the Company granted PSUs that 
vest upon the achievement of certain pre-defined company-specific performance-based criteria. Expense related to these PSUs is recognized ratably over the expected performance period once the pre-defined performance-based criteria for vesting becomes probable and can vest up to 
200
 percent of the target number of shares granted. 
The fair 
value of these PSUs is estimated based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Beginning in 2024, the structure of the PSU design was revised with a rTSR approach such that awards are earned for the Company’s rTSR performance over three-year measurement periods relative to a peer group of companies and the actual numbers of PSUs that will vest at the end of the performance period may be anywhere from 
zero
 to 
150
 percent of the target number of shares granted. The fair value of these PSUs is estimated using a Monte Carlo model because the performance target is based on a market condition. Expense related to these PSUs is recognized ratably over the three-year measurement period.

In connection with the departure of the former CEO, in September 2024 the Company incurred approximately $
10.7
 million in stock-based compensation expense as a result of accelerated equity award vesting and stock modifications under the former CEO’s severance plan.

Segment
The Company uses “the management approach” in determining reportable operating segments. The management approach considers the internal organization and reporting used by the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) for making operating decisions and assessing performance as the source for determining the Company’s reportable segments. The Company determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is internally provided to the CEO who is considered the Company’s CODM, in accordance with ASC 280, 
Segment Reporting
. The Company has determined that it operates as a single business segment, which is the development and commercialization of innovative medicines
. Refer to Note 11 – Segment Reporting for further information related to the segment.
Income Taxes
Current income tax expense or benefit represents the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or refundable for the current year. A deferred income tax asset or liability is computed for the expected future impact of differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax credits and loss carryforwards. Deferred income tax expense or benefit represents the net change during the year in the deferred income tax asset or liability. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The Company recognizes the impact of a tax position in the financial statements only if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income tax expense.
Earning (Net Loss) Per Share
Basic earnings (net loss) per share is calculated by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury stock method.

For purposes of diluted earnings (net loss) per share calculation, equity awards and employee stock purchase plan rights are considered to be common stock equivalents.

During the first quarter of 2023, the Company made a sale of all of its investments in commercial paper. The proceeds from sales of these securities were $
183.0
 million and net realized losses from the related sales were $
0.5
 million. There were no sales of available-for-sale investment securities in 2024.
At each reporting date, the Company performs an evaluation of impairment to determine if any unrealized losses are the result of credit losses. Impairment is assessed at the individual security level. Factors considered in determining whether a loss resulted from a credit loss or other factors include the Company’s intent and ability to hold the investment until the recovery of its amortized cost basis, the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer, any historical failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, any adverse legal or regulatory events affecting the issuer or issuer’s industry, any significant deterioration in economic conditions.
 The Company does not intend to sell the investment in unrealized loss position and it is unlikely that the Company will be required to sell the investment before the recovery of its amortized cost basis. Based on its evaluation, the Company determined its year-to-date credit losses related to its available-for-sale securities were immaterial at December 31, 2024
.

4. Fair Value Measurements
The Company’s investments include cash equivalents, available-for-sale investment securities consisting of money market funds, U.S. treasury notes, and marketable debt instruments of corporations and government sponsored enterprises in accordance with the Company’s investment policy, and equity investments. The Company’s investment policy defines allowable investment securities and establishes guidelines relating to credit quality, diversification, and maturities of its investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity. All investment securities have a credit rating of at least Aa3/AA- or better, or P-1/A-1 or better, as determined by Moody’s Investors Service or Standard & Poor’s.
The Company’s cash equivalents, available-for-sale investment securities, and equity securities are classified within the fair value hierarchy as defined by authoritative guidance. The Company’s investment securities and equity securities classified as Level 1 are valued using quoted market prices. The Company obtains the fair value of its Level 2 financial instruments from third-party pricing services. The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models whereby all significant inputs, including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, bids, offers, or other

F-

ACADIA PHARMACEUTICALS INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

market-related data, are observable. The Company validates the prices provided by the third-party pricing services by reviewing their pricing methods and matrices and obtaining market values from other pricing sources. After completing the validation procedures, the Company did not adjust or override any fair value measurements provided by these pricing services as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
In November 2021, the Company established a plan whereby substantially all full-time employees excluding executive management are eligible to receive a series of cash bonuses based on achievement of certain conditions as described in more detail in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company estimated the fair value of the cash awards using a Monte Carlo simulation, which utilizes level 3 inputs such as volatility, probabilities of success, and other inputs that are not observable in active markets. The cash awards are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis each reporting period, with changes in the fair value recognized as compensation cost over the derived service period of the awards.

The Company has not transferred any investment securities between the classification levels.
The recurring fair value measurements of the Company’s cash equivalents, available-for-sale investment securities, and equity securities at December 31, 
2024 and 2023 consisted of the following (in thousands):

6. Stockholders’ Equity
Stock Plans
2024 Equity Incentive Plan
The Company’s 2024 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2024 Plan) became effective upon approval of the stockholders in May 2024 and is a successor and continuation of the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2010 Plan). The 2024 Plan permits the grant of awards to employees, non-employee directors and consultants. In addition, the 2024 Plan permits the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance awards, and other awards. The 2024 Plan provides that, with limited exceptions, no award will vest until at least 12 months following the date of grant of the award; provided, however, that up to 
5
% of the aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the 2024 Plan may be subject to awards which do not meet such vesting requirements. The maximum term of any stock option or stock appreciation right awards under 2024 Plan is ten years. All shares that remained eligible for grant under the Company’s 2010 Equity Incentive Plan and 2023 Inducement Plan at the time of approval of the 2024 Plan were transferred to the 2024 Plan. 
At December 31, 2024, there were 
13,798,565
 shares of common stock available for new grants under the 2024 Plan.
2024 Inducement Plan
The Board adopted the Company’s 2024 Inducement Plan (Inducement Plan) in September 2024. The Inducement Plan permits the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, pe
rformance awards and other stock-related awards. Stock awards granted under the Inducement Plan may only be made to individuals who did not previously serve as employees or non-employee directors of the Company or an affiliate of the Company. In addition, stock awards must be approved by either a majority of the Company’s independent directors or the Compensation Committee. The terms of the Inducement Plan are otherwise substantially similar to the 2024 Plan. The maximum number of shares of Company common stock that may be issued under the Inducement Plan is 
2,400,000
 shares. At December 31, 2024, there were 
1,491,346
 shares available for new grants under the Inducement Plans.
2023 Inducement Plan

The Board adopted the Company’s 2023 Inducement Plan (2023 Inducement Plan) on February 1, 2023. The 2023 Inducement Plan permits the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance stock awards and other stock-related awards. Stock awards granted under the 2023 Inducement Plan may only be made to individuals who did not previously serve as employees or non-employee directors of the Company or an affiliate of the Company. In addition, stock awards must be approved by either a majority of the Company’s independent directors or the Compensation Committee. The terms of the 2023 Inducement Plan are otherwise substantially similar to the 2010 Plan. All shares that remained eligible for grant under the 2023 Inducement Plan at the time of approval of the 2024 Plan were transferred to the 2024 Plan.

2010 Equity Incentive Plan
The 2010 Plan, as amended to date, permits the grant of options to employees, directors and consultants. In addition, the 2010 Plan permits the grant of stock bonuses, rights to purchase restricted stock, and other stock awards. The exercise price of options granted under the 2010 Plan cannot be less than 
100
 percent of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant and the maximum term of any option is 
10
 years. Options granted under the 2010 Plan generally vest over a 
four-year
 period. 
All shares that remained eligible for grant under the Company’s 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan) at the time of approval of the 2010 Plan were transferred to the 2010 Plan. 
In June 2015, June 2016, June 2017, June 2018, June 2019 and June 2022, the Company’s stockholders approved amendments to its 2010 Plan to, among other things, increase the aggregate number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the plan by 
5,000,000
 shares, 
3,000,000
 shares, 
5,500,000

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company’s 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the Purchase Plan) became effective upon the closing of the Company’s initial public offering in June 2004. In June 2016, June 2019 and June 2020, the Company’s stockholders approved an amendment to the Purchase Plan to, among other things, increase the aggregate number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the Purchase Plan by 
400,000
 shares, 
600,000
 shares and 
3,000,000
 shares, respectively. At December 31, 2024, a total of 
5,525,000
 shares of common stock had been reserved for issuance under the Purchase Plan. At December 31, 2024, 
1,713,498
 shares of common stock remained available for issuance pursuant to the Purchase Plan. Eligible employees who elect to participate in an offe
ring under the Purchase Plan may have up to 
15
 percent of their earnings withheld, subject to certain limitations, to purchase shares of common stock pursuant to the Purchase Plan. The price of common stock purchased under the Purchase Plan is equal to 
85
 percent of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the commencement date of each offering period or the relevant purchase date.
Stock Option Activity
The equity plans provided for the grant of options to employees, directors and consultants. The exercise price of options granted under the equity plans were at 
100
 percent of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant and the maximum term of any option was 
10
 years. Options granted under the equity plans generally vested over a 
four-year
 period.

Contingent Cash Awards

In November 2021, the Company established a plan whereby substantially all full-time employees excluding executive management are eligible to receive a series of cash bonuses over certain periods based on continued employment and the Company’s stock price reaching a pre-specified target. The maximum potential payout of the cash awards at the grant date was $
15.1
 million. The Company has determined that the cash awards were classified as liabilities pursuant to ASC Topic 718, 
Compensation – Stock Compensation
. 
The Company estimates the fair value of the awards at each reporting period using the Monte Carlo simulation, which is recognized as compensation cost over the derived service period. Total fair value of the awards at the grant date was $
4.4
 million. The awards were forfeited in November 2024 as the Company’s stock price did not reach the pre-specified target and the Company recorded a reversal of $
4.5
 million of compensation expense related to the awards during the year ended December 31, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the awards had a total fair value of $
5.2

At December 31, 2024, the Company had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately 
$
130.2
 million, 
$
453.9
 million, and 
$
475.2
 million, respectively. The Company recognized federal and state income tax provisions of 
$
31.6
 million, 
$
10.3
 million and 
$
2.5
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These tax liabilities were primarily associated with federal and state liabilities in excess of net operating losses in the current year and an increase in federal and state reserves related to uncertain tax positions. Utilization of the domestic NOL and research and development (R&D) credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that have occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by Section 382 of the Code, as well as similar state and foreign provisions. These ownership changes may limit the amount of NOL and R&D credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an “ownership change” as defined by Section 382 of the Code results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders or public groups.
The Company previously completed a study to assess whether an ownership change, as defined by Section 382 of the Code, had occurred from the Company’s formation through December 31, 2013. Based upon this study, the Company determined that several ownership changes had occurred. Accordingly, the Company reduced its deferred tax assets related to the federal NOL carryforwards and the federal R&D credit carryforwards that are anticipated to expire unused as a result of these ownership changes. These tax attributes were excluded from deferred tax assets with a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance with no net effect on income tax expense or the effective tax rate. The Company completed a study through December 31, 2024 and concluded no additional ownership changes occurred. Future ownership changes may further limit the Company’s ability to utilize its remaining tax attributes.

Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, if any, the timing and amount of which are uncertain.  The Company assesses all available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit use of the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative book loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2024. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as projections for future growth. On the basis of this analysis, a valuation allowance of $
455.0
 million and $
482.1
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was recorded to offset the net deferred tax asset as realization of such asset is uncertain. However, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as the Company’s projections for future growth.
An accounting policy may be selected to either (i) treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) as a current-period expense when incurred or (ii) factor such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes. The Company has elected to account for GILTI as a period cost.

The tax years 2003 – 2024 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.
The Company recognizes a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. The Company recorded an uncertain tax position reserve of $1
.3
 million, $
18.0
 million and 
$
5.1
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Due to the valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s deferred tax assets, approximately $
8.7
 million and $
6.8
 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, would reduce the annual effective tax rate if recognized. The Company does not anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024 will significantly change within the next twelve months. The Company
’s practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in income tax expense. The Company had immaterial interest and/or penalties accrued on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2024 or 2023, respectively. Further, the Company recognized an insignificant amount of interest and/or penalties in the statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to uncertain tax positions.

The Company has entered into various collaboration, licensing and merger agreements which provide the Company with rights to certain know-how, technology and patent rights. The agreements generally include upfront license fees, development and commercial milestone payments upon achievement of certain clinical and commercial development and annual net sales milestones, as well as royalties calculated as a percentage of product revenues, with rates that vary by agreement. The Company incurred $
34.5
 million, $
102.5
 million and $
88.7
 million in upfront and license payments in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These upfront and license payments were included in the research and development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations as there was no alternative future use associated with the payments. As of December 31, 2024, the Company may be required to make milestone payments up to 
$
4.0
 billion in the aggregate for candidates in its pipeline, 
of which, pursuant to the license agreement with Neuren, $
50.0
 million is payable to Neuren within 60 days following Neuren’s invoice delivered after December 31, 2024 as the Company’s aggregate net revenue of trofinetide in North America for the treatment of Rett syndrome exceeded $
250.0
 million in 2024.
In May 2018, the Company signed an Exclusivity Deed (the Deed) with Neuren that provided for exclusive negotiations for a period of three months from the date of the Deed. Under the terms of the Deed, the Company invested $
3.1
 million to subscribe for 
1,330,000
 shares of Neuren and paid $
0.9
 million for the exclusive right to negotiate a deal with Neuren, which was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the second quarter of 2018. In 2023, the Company sold the 
1,330,000
 shares of Neuren for total proceeds of $
12.3
 million. Net gain on the strategic investments recognized in other income in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 
2023 and 2022
 was $
5.1
 million 
and $
3.5
 million, respectively
. 
No
 gain was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2024.
In August 2018, the Company entered into a license agreement with Neuren and obtained exclusive North American rights to develop and commercialize trofinetide for Rett syndrome and other indications. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company paid Neuren an upfront license fee of $
10.0
 million and it may be required to pay up to an additional $
455.0
 million in milestone payments based on the achievement of certain development and annual net sales milestones. In addition, the Company will be required to pay Neuren tiered, escalating, double-digit percentage royalties based on net sales. The license agreement was accounted for as an asset acquisition and the upfront cash payment of $
10.0
 million was expensed to research and development in the third quarter of 2018 as there is no alternative use for the asset. In connection with the FDA approval of DAYBUE, the Company paid a milestone payment of $
40.0
 million to Neuren following the first commercial sale of DAYBUE pursuant to the license agreement. The Company capitalized the $
40.0
 million milestone payment as an intangible asset as it was deemed probable of occurring as of March 31, 2023. In addition, the Company was granted a Rare Pediatric Disease PRV following the FDA approval of DAYBUE. Pursuant to the license agreement, the Company is required to pay Neuren one third of the value of the PRV at the time of sale or use of the PRV. The Company capitalized the $
29.6
 million for the estimated PRV value owed to Neuren as an intangible asset in 2023. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company sold the PRV to a third party for aggregate net proceeds of $
146.5
 million. 
U
pon sale of the PRV, the Company capitalized an additional $
19.2
 million for the one third PRV value owed to Neuren as an intangible asset.
In July 2023, the Company expanded its licensing agreement for trofinetide with Neuren to acquire rights to the drug outside of North America as well as global rights in Rett syndrome and Fragile X syndrome to Neuren’s development candidate NNZ-2591. Under the terms of the expanded agreement, Neuren received an upfront payment of $
100.0
 million and is eligible to receive up to an additional $
426.3
 million in milestone payments based on the achievement of certain commercial and sales milestones for trofinetide outside of North America and up to $
831.3
 million in milestone payments based on the achievement of certain development and sales milestones for NNZ-2591. In addition, the Company will be required to pay Neuren tiered royalties from the mid-teens to low-twenties percent of trofinetide net sales outside of North America. Percentage royalties related to NNZ-2591 net sales are identical to the trofinetide in each of North America and outside North America. The expanded license agreement was accounted for as an asset acquisition and the upfront cash payment of $
100.0
 million was expensed to research and development in the third quarter of 2023 as there is no alternative use for the asset.

Legal Proceedings
Patent Infringement

On July 24, 2020, the Company filed complaints against (i) Aurobindo Pharma Limited and its affiliate Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. and (ii) Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. and its affiliate Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., and on July 30, 2020, the Company filed complaints against (i) Hetero Labs Limited and its affiliates Hetero Labs Limited Unit-V and Hetero USA Inc., (ii) MSN Laboratories Private Ltd. and its affiliate MSN Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and (iii) Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. and its affiliate Cadila Healthcare Limited. These complaints, which were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, allege infringement of certain of the Company’s Orange Book-listed patents covering NUPLAZID (Pimavanserin I Cases).

The Company entered into an agreement effective April 22, 2021 with Hetero settling all claims and counterclaims in the litigation. The agreement allows Hetero to launch its generic pimavanserin product on February 27, 2038, subject to certain triggers for earlier launch. The Hetero case was dismissed by joint agreement on May 3, 2021.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On September 30, 2022, the Company filed a stipulation and proposed order to stay the claims currently asserted against Teva and for Teva to be bound by the result of the litigation rendered against the remaining defendants Aurobindo and MSN, which was ordered by the Court on October 4, 2022.
On October 21, 2022, the Company filed additional complaints against Aurobindo, MSN and Zydus in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging infringement of an additional Orange Book-listed patent covering NUPLAZID (Pimavanserin II Cases).

The Company entered into an agreement, effective March 31, 2023, with Zydus settling all claims and counterclaims in the Pimavanserin I Cases and Pimavanserin II Cases. The agreement allows Zydus to launch its generic pimavanserin 10 mg tablet products on September 23, 2036 and 34 mg capsule products on February 27, 2038, subject to certain triggers for earlier launch. The Zydus case was dismissed by joint agreement on April 5, 2023.

As a result of the above, only MSN remained as an active defendant in the Pimavanserin I Cases. On January 11, 2024, following summary judgment motions, the District Court entered final judgment in the Company’s favor that MSN’s submission of ANDA No. 214925 was an act of infringement in the Pimavanserin I Case and the ’740 patent was not invalid. On January 18, 2024, MSN filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit from the final judgment entered on January 11, 2024. The appeal is fully briefed and awaiting a date for oral argument.
In connection with the Pimavanserin II cases, MSN and Aurobindo are the remaining defendants. A bench trial was conducted from December 3, 2024 to December 6, 2024 in the matter. Post-trial briefing was completed on February 12, 2025 and the Company is awaiting the final decision of the Court.
On February 14, 2025, the Company filed a complaint against Zydus Lifesciences Limited, Zydus Worldwide DMCC, and Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. (collectively “Zydus”) in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging infringement of certain of the Company’s Orange Book-listed patents covering NUPLAZID (Pimavanserin) by Zydus’ proposed 34 mg pimavanserin tablet product. Zydus has not responded to the complaint as of yet and there is no schedule in place for the case.
Securities Class Action

On April 19, 2021, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative securities class action complaint (captioned 
City of

Birmingham Relief Retirement Systems
 v. Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Case No. 21-cv-0762) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against the Company and certain of the Company’s current executive officers. On September 29, 2021, the Court issued an order designating lead plaintiff and lead counsel. On December 10, 2021, lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint generally alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by failing to disclose that the materials submitted in support of its sNDA seeking approval of pimavanserin for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with dementia-related psychosis contained statistical and design deficiencies and that the FDA was unlikely to approve the sNDA in its current form. The amended complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages and other relief. On March 11, 2024, the Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and appointment of class representatives and class counsel. The parties are currently engaged in expert discovery, which is scheduled to close on June 13, 2025.
Opt-Out Litigation
On March 7, 2024, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a complaint (captioned 
Alger Dynamic Opportunities Fund v. Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
, Case No. 24-cv-00451) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against the Company and one executive officer. The complaint is based on the same underlying allegations as the Securities Class Action described above, and alleged claims under federal and state securities laws, and for common law fraud and negligent misrepresentations. On May 24, 2024, Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint. On October 31, 2024, the Court granted in part and denied in part Defendants’ motion to dismiss. The Court dismissed with leave to amend the purported stockholder’s state and common law claims, as well as the claim brought under Section 18(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Defendants filed their answer to the Sections 10(b) and 20(a) claims on December 16, 2024. On January 13, 2025, the Court stayed this suit pending the outcome of the Securities Class Action.

Derivative Suit
On December 15, 2023, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a derivative action (captioned 
Kanner et al v. Biggar et al.
, Case No. 23-cv-2293) in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against certain of the Company’s current directors. The Company is named as a nominal defendant. The complaint is based on the same alleged misconduct as the Securities Class Action, and asserts state law claims, on behalf of the Company, against the individual defendants for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, waste of corporate assets, and insider trading. The complaint also asserts federal claims under sections 10(b), 21D, and 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. On December 27, 2023, the action was reassigned to District Judge William Q. Hayes and Magistrate Judge Michael S. Berg due to its relation to the Securities Class Action.  On January 30, 2024, the parties jointly requested a stay of the action. The Court granted that request and the action was stayed on February 20, 2024, pending the outcome of our Demand Review Committee’s investigation into the underlying claims.
Given the unpredictability inherent in litigation, the Company cannot predict the outcome of these matters. The Company is unable to estimate possible losses or ranges of losses that may result from these matters, and therefore it has not accrued any amounts in connection with these matters other than attorneys’ fees incurred to date.

11. Segment Reporting
In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 280, 
Segment Reporting
, m
anagement has determined that the Company operates in 
one
 business segment which is the development and commercialization of innovative medicines. 
All revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were generated from customers in the United States.
The Company’s CODM is the CEO who uses the consolidated statement of operations to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Managing and allocating resources on a consolidated basis enables the CODM to assess the overall level of resources available and how to best deploy these resources across functions and research and development programs that are in line with the Company’s long-term company-wide strategic goals.
The key areas of focus by CODM for allocation of resources are revenues from each product, as well as operating expenses (cost of goods sold, license fees and royalties, research and development expense, selling, general and administrative expense, and other income or loss). While the CODM analyzes these categories, the area of focus is period over period fluxes and budget-to-actual variances to determine the right allocation of resources is attributed to the segment in order to ensure profitability is maximized.
