Item 1. Business – Competition for additional discussion of the Company’s competition.
The Company must effectively execute its business strategy in order to continue asset and earnings growth
.    The Company’s core strategy is to develop its business principally through organic growth by offering a differentiated banking experience to companies in high-value business segments. Its prospects for continued growth must be considered in light of the risks, 
20
expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by growing companies. In order to execute the Company’s business strategy successfully, the Company must, among other things:
•
continue to identify and expand into suitable markets and lines of business, in Texas, regionally and nationally;
•
develop new products and services and execute the full range of products and services more efficiently and effectively;
•
attract and retain qualified front-line personnel in each of the targeted market segments to build customer base;
•
respond to market opportunities promptly and nimbly while balancing the demands of risk management and compliance with regulatory requirements;
•
expand loan portfolio in an intensely competitive environment while maintaining credit quality;
•
attract sufficient deposits and capital to fund expected and anticipated loan growth and satisfy regulatory requirements;
•
compete effectively for investment banking and broker-dealer customers;
•
control expenses; and
•
acquire and maintain sufficient qualified staffing and information technology and operational resources to support growth and compliance with regulatory requirements.
Failure to effectively execute the business strategy could have a material adverse effect on the business, future prospects, financial condition, results of operations or profitability.
The Company must be effective in developing and executing new lines of business and new products and services while managing associated risks, including the ability to use technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands
.    The Company’s business strategy involves developing and growing new lines of business and offering new products and services, including through the introduction of new technologies, within existing lines of business to grow its client base, retain existing clients and realize strategic priorities for revenue growth. Substantial costs, risks and uncertainties are associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. Developing and marketing new activities requires that the Company invests significant time and resources before new sources of revenues, funding and profits can be realized. Timetables for the development and launch of new activities may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible, or their realization may be delayed. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, receipt of necessary licenses or permits, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also adversely impact the successful execution of new activities. New activities necessarily entail additional risks and may present additional risks to the effectiveness of the Company’s system of internal controls and risk management strategies. All service offerings, including current offerings and new activities, may become more risky due to changes in economic, competitive and market conditions beyond the Company’s control. Regulators could determine that the Company’s, the Bank’s or TCBI Securities’ risk management practices are not adequate or the Company’s, the Bank’s or TCBI Securities’ capital levels are not sufficiently in excess of well capitalized levels and take action to restrain growth. Failure to successfully manage these risks, generally and to the satisfaction of regulators, in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition.
The Company may pursue bank and non-bank acquisition opportunities as they arise. However, even if the Company identifies attractive acquisition opportunities, it may not be able to complete such acquisitions on favorable terms or realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions.  
While the Company continues to focus on organic growth opportunities, it may pursue attractive bank or non-bank acquisition and consolidation opportunities that arise in the Company’s core markets and beyond. The number of financial institutions headquartered in Texas, regionally and nationally, continues to decline through merger and other consolidation activity. In the event that attractive acquisition opportunities arise, the Company would likely face competition for such acquisitions from other banking and financial companies, many of which have significantly greater resources and may have more attractive valuations. This competition could either prevent the Company from being able to complete attractive acquisition opportunities or increase prices for potential acquisitions which could reduce the Company’s potential returns and reduce the attractiveness of these opportunities. Furthermore, even if the Company is able to identify and complete acquisitions, the terms of such acquisitions may not be favorable to the Company or it may fail to realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions. In addition, all acquisitions are subject to various regulatory approvals, and if the Company were unable (or there was a perception that the Company would be unable) to obtain such approvals for any reason, including due to any actual or perceived capital, liquidity, profitability, or regulatory compliance issues, it would impair the Company’s ability to consummate acquisitions. Any acquisition could also be dilutive to the Company’s earnings and shareholders’ equity per share of the Company’s common stock.
Operational Risks
The Company must continue to attract, retain and develop key personnel
.    The Company’s success depends to a significant extent upon its ability to attract, develop and retain experienced personnel in each of its lines of business and markets including managers in operational areas, compliance and other support areas to build and maintain the infrastructure and controls required 
21
to support continuing growth. Competition for the best people in the industry can be intense, and there is no assurance that the Company will continue to attract or retain talent or develop personnel. Factors that affect its ability to attract, develop and retain key employees include compensation and benefits programs, profitability, ability to establish appropriate succession plans for key talent, reputation for rewarding and promoting qualified employees and market competition for employees with certain skills, including information systems development and security. The cost of employee compensation is a significant portion of operating expenses and can materially impact results of operations or profitability, especially during periods of wage inflation. The unanticipated loss of the services of key personnel could have an adverse effect on the business.
The Company, its vendors and customers must effectively manage information systems and cyber risk and threats which may result in disruptions, failures or breaches in security.    
The Company, its vendors and customers all rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct their respective businesses, store sensitive data and work effectively together. The financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends in part upon its ability to use technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands.  Many of

the Company’s larger competitors invest substantially greater resources in technological capabilities than the Company does. The Company may not be able to effectively protect, develop and manage mission critical systems and IT infrastructure to support strategic business initiatives, which could impair its ability to achieve financial, operational, compliance and strategic objectives and negatively affect the business, results of operations, financial condition or profitability.
Communications and information systems and those of the Company’s vendors and customers remain vulnerable to unexpected disruptions, failures and cyber-attacks. Any disruptions, failures or breaches in security of these systems could result in significant disruption to the Company’s operations. Information security breaches and cyber-security-related incidents include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, theft of information, credentials or other intellectual property, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, data breaches resulting in misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer and employee information), ransomware attacks, account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. These types of threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties or may result from accidental technological failure. The risk, frequency and intensity of such attacks is escalating, including as a result of remote working arrangements, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication of these threats. Material failures or interruptions of these systems could impair the Company’s ability to serve customers and to operate the business and could damage the Company’s reputation, result in a loss of business, subject the Company or the Bank to additional regulatory scrutiny or enforcement or exposure to civil litigation, criminal penalties or financial liability.  While the Company has developed extensive recovery plans, the Company cannot assure that those plans will be effective to prevent adverse effects resulting from system failures.
The use of the Company’s cloud technologies is also critical to the operation of systems, and its reliance on cloud technologies is growing. Service disruptions in cloud technologies may lead to delays in accessing, or the loss of, data that is important to the businesses and may hinder clients’ access to products and services.
The Company collects and stores sensitive data, including personally identifiable information of its customers and employees and in the ordinary course of business must allow certain vendors access to that data. Breaches of the systems or vendors' or customers’ systems, thefts of data and other breaches and criminal activity may result in significant costs to respond or remediate losses if the Company or its vendors are at fault, damage to the Company’s customer relationships, regulatory scrutiny and enforcement and loss of future business opportunities due to reputational damage. Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are rapidly and constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected for a period of time or at all. Accordingly, the Company may be unable to anticipate or be prepared for these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is impossible for the Company to entirely mitigate this risk.
Breaches can be perpetrated by unknown third parties, but could also be facilitated by employees either inadvertently or by consciously attempting to create disruption or certain acts of fraud. The Company’s customers and employees have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent e-mails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords, bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through “Trojan horse” programs to the Company’s information systems, the information systems of merchants or third-party service providers and/or customers' computers. Although the Company, with the help of third-party service providers, will continue to implement information security technology solutions and establish operational procedures to protect sensitive data, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective. The Company advises, or alerts and provides some guidance to customers and evaluates and imposes security requirements on vendors regarding protection of their respective information systems, but there is no assurance that these actions will have the intended positive effects or will be effective to prevent losses or attacks. Successful cyber-attacks on the Company, vendors or customers may affect the Company’s reputation, and failure to meet 
22
customer expectations could have a material impact on the Company’s ability to attract and retain deposits as a primary source of funding.
A security breach or other significant disruption of information systems or those related to customers, merchants and third-party vendors, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could (i) disrupt the proper functioning of networks and systems and therefore the operations and/or those of certain customers; (ii) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information; (iii) result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny and exposure to civil litigation, criminal penalties, governmental fines or financial liability; (iv) require significant management attention and resources to respond, remediate or remedy the damages that result; or (v) harm the reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with the Company. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or profitability.
A successful cyber attack affecting the Company could cause significant harm to the Company and its clients and customers.
    The Company and similar financial institutions are subject to continuous threats from cyber attacks on its computer systems, software, networks and other technology from various actors, including groups acting on behalf of hostile countries, cyber-criminals, “hacktivists” (i.e., individuals or groups that use technology to promote a political agenda or social change) and others. These cyber attacks can take many forms, including attempts to introduce computer viruses or malicious code, which are commonly referred to as “malware,” into the Company’s systems. These attacks are often designed to: obtain unauthorized access to confidential information belonging to the Company or its clients, customers, counterparties or employees, manipulate data, destroy data or systems with the aim of rendering services unavailable, disrupt, sabotage or degrade service on the Company’s systems, steal money, or extort money through the use of so-called “ransomware.” The Company has experienced security breaches and cyber attacks in the past, and it is inevitable that additional breaches and attacks will occur in the future. While such breaches and attacks have not materially impacted the Company to date, future security breaches and cyber attacks could result in serious and harmful consequences for the Company or its clients and customers. A principal reason that the Company cannot provide absolute security against cyber attacks is that it may not always be possible to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to the Company’s systems, or to implement effective preventive measures against all breaches because: the techniques used in cyber attacks evolve frequently and are increasingly sophisticated, and therefore may not be recognized until launched, cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including the Company’s own employees, cyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups linked to terrorist organizations or hostile countries, or third parties whose objective is to disrupt the operations of financial institutions more generally, the Company does not have control over the cybersecurity of the systems of the large number of clients, customers, counterparties and third-party service providers with which it does business, and it is possible that a third party, after establishing a foothold on an internal network without being detected, might obtain access to other networks and systems. The risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack could increase in the future due to factors such as: the Company’s ongoing expansion of its mobile and digital banking and other internet-based product offerings and its internal use of internet-based products and applications and the increased use of remote access to facilitate remote arrangements for employees, vendors and other third parties. In addition, a third party could misappropriate confidential information obtained by intercepting signals or communications from mobile devices used by the Company’s employees. A successful penetration or circumvention of the security of the Company’s systems or the systems of a vendor, governmental body or another market participant could cause serious negative consequences, including: significant disruption of the Company’s operations and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, including losing access to operational systems, misappropriation of confidential information of the Company or that of its clients, customers, counterparties, employees or regulators, disruption of or damage to the Company’s systems and those of its clients, customers and counterparties, the inability, or extended delays in the ability, to fully recover and restore data that has been stolen, manipulated or destroyed, or the inability to prevent systems from processing fraudulent transactions, allegations or violations by the Company of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to the Company or to its clients, customers, counterparties or employees, loss of confidence in the Company’s cybersecurity and business resiliency measures, dissatisfaction among the Company’s clients, customers or counterparties, significant exposure to litigation and regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, and harm to the Company’s reputation. The extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps that the Company may need to take to investigate the attack may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such an investigation or determination, judicial or otherwise, can be completed. While such an investigation is ongoing, the Company may not necessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by the cyber attack, and that damage may continue to spread. These factors may inhibit the Company’s ability to provide rapid, full and reliable information about the cyber attack to its clients, customers, counterparties and regulators, and the public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best to contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber attack, and certain errors or actions could be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and remediated. Any or all of these factors could further increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.
The Company’s operations rely extensively on a broad range of external vendors.    
The Company relies on a large number of vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain the day-to-day operations, particularly in the areas of operations, treasury management systems, information technology and security. This reliance exposes the Company to the risk 
23
that these vendors will not perform as required by agreements including risks resulting from disruptions in communications with vendors, cyber-attacks and security breaches at vendors, failure of a vendor to provide services for other reasons and poor performance of services. An external vendor’s failure to perform in any of these areas could be disruptive to the business and operations, which could have a material adverse impact on the business, financial condition, results of operations or profitability, including causing reputational damage. External vendors who must have access to the Company’s information systems in order to provide their services have been identified as significant sources of information technology security risk and are monitored. While the Company has implemented an active program of oversight to address this risk, there can be no assurance that the Company will not experience material security breaches associated with vendors or other third parties.
The development and use of AI presents risks and challenges that may adversely impact the Company’s business.    
The Company or its third-party (or fourth party) vendors, clients or counterparties may develop or incorporate AI technology in certain business processes, services, or products. The development and use of AI presents a number of risks and challenges to the Company’s business. The legal and regulatory environment relating to AI is uncertain and rapidly evolving, both in the U.S. and internationally, and includes regulatory schemes targeted specifically at AI as well as provisions in intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, employment, and other laws applicable to the use of AI. These evolving laws and regulations could require changes in the Company’s implementation of AI technology and increase the Company’s compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance. AI models, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, that reflects biases included in the data on which they are trained, that results in the release of private, confidential, or proprietary information, that infringes on the intellectual property rights of others, or that is otherwise harmful. In addition, the complexity of many AI models makes it difficult to understand why they are generating particular outputs. This limited transparency increases the challenges associated with assessing the proper operation of AI models, understanding and monitoring the capabilities of the AI models, reducing erroneous output, eliminating bias, and complying with regulations that require documentation or explanation of the basis on which decisions are made. Further, the Company may rely on AI models developed by third parties, and, to that extent, would be dependent in part on the manner in which those third parties develop and train their models, including risks arising from the inclusion of any unauthorized material in the training data for their models and the effectiveness of the steps these third parties have taken to limit the risks associated with the output of their models, matters over which the Company may have limited visibility. Any of these risks could expose the Company to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm the Company’s reputation and the public perception of its business or the effectiveness of its security measures.
The Company’s accounting estimates and risk management processes rely on management judgment, which may prove inadequate, wrong or be adversely impacted by inaccurate or mistakes in assumptions or models.    
The processes the Company’s uses to estimate expected credit losses for purposes of establishing the allowance for credit losses and to measure the fair value of financial instruments, certain liquidity and capital planning tools, including the processes the Company uses to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on its financial condition and results of operations, all depend upon management’s judgment. Management’s judgment and the data relied upon by management may be based on assumptions that prove to be inaccurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances. Additionally, CECL requires the application of greater management judgment that is supported by new models and more data elements, including macroeconomic forecasts, than the previous allowance standard. The Company’s adoption of the CECL model has increased the complexity, and associated risk, of the analysis and processes relying on management judgment, which could negatively impact the financial condition, results of operations or profitability of the Company.
The risk management strategies and processes may not be effective and the Company’s controls and procedures, including disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, may fail or be circumvented
.    The Company continues to invest in the development of risk management techniques, strategies, assessment methods and related controls and monitoring approaches on an ongoing basis. However, these risk management strategies and processes may not be fully effective in mitigating the risk exposure in all economic market environments or against all types of risk. Any failures in risk management strategies and processes to accurately identify, quantify and monitor risk exposure could limit the ability to effectively manage risks. Management regularly reviews and updates internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. In particular, any failure to maintain or develop effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures and or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could cause the Company to fail to meet its reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of its financial statements for prior periods. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in the Company’s reported financial and other information, including if the Company were to report a material weakness, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of the Company’s common stock. If the Company has a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting, the Company may not detect errors on a timely basis and its financial statements may be materially misstated. If the Company is unable to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls, the Company could become subject to investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities or shareholder litigation, which could require 
24
additional management attention and which could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and management judgment and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or profitability.
The business is susceptible to fraud and conduct risk.    
The Company’s business exposes it to fraud risk from loan and deposit customers, the parties they do business with, as well as from employees, contractors and vendors. The Company relies on financial and other data from new and existing customers which could turn out to be fraudulent when accepting such customers, executing their financial transactions and making and purchasing loans and other financial assets. In times of increased economic stress the Company is at increased risk of fraud losses. The Company believes it has underwriting and operational controls in place to prevent or detect such fraud, but cannot provide assurance that these controls will be effective in detecting fraud or that the Company will not experience fraud losses or incur costs or other damage related to such fraud, at levels that adversely affect financial results or reputation. The Company’s lending customers may also experience fraud in their businesses which could adversely affect their ability to repay their loans or make use of services. The Company’s and its customers’ exposure to fraud may increase the Company’s financial risk and reputation risk as it may result in unexpected loan losses that exceed those that have been provided for in the allowance for credit losses. In addition, the Company is subject to risk from the conduct of its employees, including the negative impact that can result from employee misconduct or failure by employees to conduct themselves in accordance with the Company’s policies.  All of which could damage the Company’s reputation and result in loss of customers or other financial loss or expose the Company to increased regulatory or other risk. 
Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks
The Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and interpretations thereof
.    The Company, as a bank holding company and financial holding company, and the Bank, as a Texas state-chartered bank, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision and the potential for regulatory enforcement actions, which impact the business on a daily basis. TCBI Securities is also subject to the jurisdiction of several regulatory bodies, including the SEC, FINRA, MSRB and state securities regulators. These regulations affect lending practices, permissible products and services and their terms and conditions, customer relationships, capital structure, investment practices, accounting, financial reporting, operations and ability to grow, among other things. These regulations also impose obligations to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identities of customers. See the discussion above at 
Business - Regulation and Supervision
 for additional discussion of the extensive regulation and supervision the Company and the Bank are subject to.
The level of regulatory scrutiny that the Company and the Bank are subject to may fluctuate over time, based on numerous factors. In addition, Congress, state legislatures, and federal and state regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect the Company and the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. Material changes in regulation and requirements imposed on financial institutions, such as the Dodd-Frank Act, Basel III Capital Rules, European Union's General Data Protection Regulations and California Consumer Privacy Act result in additional costs, impose more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements, limit the types of financial services and products the Company may offer and increase the ability of non-bank financial services providers to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Such changes could result in new regulatory obligations which could prove difficult, expensive or competitively impractical to comply with if not equally imposed upon non-bank financial services providers with whom the Company competes. 
The Company is subject to a continuous program and routine of examinations by regulators concerning, among other things, lending practices, reserve methodology, compliance with changing regulations and interpretations, BSA/AMLA compliance, interest rate management, liquidity, capital and operational risk, enterprise risk management, regulatory and financial accounting practices and policies and related matters, which can divert management’s time and attention from focusing on the business. The Company devotes a significant amount of management time and expense to enhancing the infrastructure to support its compliance obligations, which can pose significant regulatory enforcement, financial and reputational risks if not appropriately addressed.
The Company expends substantial effort and incurs costs to maintain and improve its systems, controls, accounting, operations, information security, compliance, audit effectiveness, analytical capabilities, staffing and training in order to satisfy regulatory requirements or recommendations. The Company cannot offer assurance that these efforts will be accepted by regulators as satisfying the applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with relevant laws, regulations, recommendations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur.
25
The Company must maintain adequate regulatory capital to support its business objectives and strategy
.    Under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements, the Company must satisfy capital requirements based upon quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items.  Satisfaction of these requirements is subject to qualitative judgments by regulators that may differ materially from management’s and that are subject to being determined retroactively for prior periods. Additionally, regulators can make subjective assessments about the adequacy of capital levels, even if the Company’s and the Bank's reported capital exceeds the “well capitalized” requirements. The Company’s ability to maintain its status as a financial holding company and to continue to operate the Bank as it has in recent periods is dependent upon a number of factors, including the Bank qualifying as “well capitalized” and “well managed” under applicable prompt corrective action regulations and upon the Company qualifying on an ongoing basis as “well capitalized” and “well managed” under applicable Federal Reserve regulations.
Failure to meet regulatory capital standards could have a material adverse effect on the business, including damaging the confidence of customers, adversely impacting the Company’s and the Bank’s reputation and competitive position and retention of key personnel. Any of these developments could limit access to:
•
brokered deposits;
•
FRB discount window;
•
advances from the FHLB;
•
capital markets transactions; and
•
development of new financial services.
Failure to meet regulatory capital standards may also result in higher FDIC assessments.  If the Company or the Bank falls below guidelines for being deemed “adequately capitalized” the FDIC or Federal Reserve could impose restrictions on banking activities and a broad range of regulatory requirements in order to effect “prompt corrective action.”  The capital requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank are in a process of continuous evaluation and revision in connection with actions of the Basel Committee and regulators. The Company cannot predict the final form, or the effects, of these regulations on the business, but among the possible effects are requirements that the Company slow the rate of growth or obtain additional capital which could reduce earnings or dilute existing stockholders.
The Company is subject to claims and litigation in the ordinary course of its business, including claims that may not be covered by insurance.    
Customers and other parties the Company engage with may, on a regular basis, assert claims and take legal action against the Company and the Company regularly takes legal action to collect unpaid borrowers’ obligations, realize on collateral and assert rights in commercial and other contexts. These actions frequently result in counter claims against the Company. Litigation arises in a variety of contexts, including lending activities, employment practices, commercial agreements, fiduciary responsibility related to wealth management services, intellectual property rights and other general business and banking matters.
Claims and legal actions may result in significant legal costs to defend or assert rights and may result in reputational damage that adversely affects existing and future customer relationships. If claims and legal actions are not resolved in a favorable manner, the Company may suffer significant financial liability or adverse effects on its reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or profitability. See 
Legal Proceedings
 below for additional disclosures regarding legal proceedings.
The Company purchases insurance coverage to mitigate a wide range of risks. There is no assurance that insurance will be adequate to protect the Company against material losses in excess of coverage limits or that insurers will perform their obligations under policies without attempting to limit or exclude coverage. The Company could be required to pursue legal actions against insurers to obtain payment of amounts owed, and there is no assurance that such actions, if pursued, would be successful.
Other Risks Affecting the Business
The business faces unpredictable economic and business conditions
.    The business is directly impacted by general economic, business and political conditions in Texas, the United States and internationally. The credit quality of the loan portfolio necessarily reflects, among other things, the general economic conditions in the areas in which the Company and its customers conduct their respective businesses. The Company’s financial condition can be affected by other factors that are beyond its control, including:
•
geopolitical, national, regional and local economic conditions;
•
the value of the U.S. Dollar in relation to the currencies of other advanced and emerging market countries;
•
the performance of both domestic and international equity and debt markets and valuation of securities traded on recognized domestic and international exchanges;
26
•
general economic consequences of international conditions and the impact of those conditions on the U.S. and global economies;
•
legislative and regulatory changes impacting the banking industry;
•
impact of the 2024 presidential and congressional elections and other political conditions;
•
the financial health of customers and economic conditions affecting them and the value of collateral, including effects from the continued price volatility of oil and gas and other commodities;
•
the incidence of fraud, illegal payments, security breaches and other illegal acts among or impacting the Company, its customers and third parties;
•
structural changes in the markets for origination, sale and servicing of residential mortgages;
•
changes in governmental economic and regulatory policies, including the extent and timing of intervention in credit markets by the Federal Reserve or withdrawal from that intervention, generally including changes attributable to presidential and congressional elections;
•
acts or threats of war, including the ongoing war in Ukraine and the Israeli Palestinian conflict;
•
changes in the availability of liquidity at a systemic level; and
•
material inflation or deflation.
Substantial deterioration in any of the foregoing conditions can have a material adverse effect on prospects and results of operations and financial condition. Declining or adverse economic conditions and adverse changes in investor, consumer and business sentiment generally result in reduced business activity, which may decrease the demand for products and services. Recently, inflation has been at a higher level than experienced in many decades, which has increased costs and impacted operations for the Company and many of its customers. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to return to historical rate of growth or profitability. The Company's customer base is primarily commercial in nature, and the Company does not have a significant retail branch network or retail consumer deposit base. In periods of economic downturn, business and commercial deposits may be more volatile than traditional retail consumer deposits.  As a result, the financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected to a greater degree by these uncertainties than competitors having a larger retail customer base. Additionally, the Company’s investment banking revenue is directly related to general economic conditions and corresponding financial market activity. When the outlook for such economic conditions is uncertain or negative, financial market activity generally tends to decrease, which can be expected to reduce the Company’s investment banking revenues and prospects for new business.
The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect the business.
    Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and the Company routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including broker-dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due. There can be no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect results of operations or profitability.
Negative developments affecting the banking industry, and resulting media coverage, have eroded customer confidence in the banking system.

   Any future bank failures like those experienced in 2023 or similar events may negatively impact customer confidence in the safety and soundness of regional banks and may generate market volatility among publicly traded bank holding companies and, in particular, regional banks like the Company. As a result, customers may choose to maintain deposits with larger financial institutions or invest in higher yielding short-term fixed income securities, all of which could materially adversely impact the Company’s liquidity, loan funding capacity, net interest margin, capital and results of operations. While the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC historically have taken action to ensure that depositors of failed banks had access to their deposits, including uninsured deposit accounts, there is no guarantee that regional bank failures or bank runs will not occur in the future and, if they were to occur, they may have a material and adverse impact on customer and investor confidence in regional banks negatively impacting the Company’s liquidity, capital, results of operations and stock price.
The Company is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.    
A significant portion of the loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, the Company may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. There is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties, and that the Company may be liable for remediation costs, including personal injury and property damage. Environmental laws may require incurring substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property's value by limiting the ability to use or sell it. Although the Company has policies and procedures requiring environmental review before initiating any foreclosure 
27
action on real property, these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on financial condition, results of operations and profitability. Future laws or regulations or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws and regulations may increase the Company’s exposure to environmental liability.
Severe weather, earthquakes, other natural disasters, climate change, pandemics, acts of war or terrorism and other external and geopolitical events could significantly impact the business
.    Severe weather, earthquakes, other natural disasters, pandemics, climate change, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company’s ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of its deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue, cause us to incur additional expenses or disrupt the Company’s operations. In recent years, hurricanes have caused extensive flooding and destruction along the coastal areas of Texas and in other areas in the U.S., including communities where the Company conducts business. Climate change has the potential to increase to frequency and severity of these severe weather events in the future. Although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or profitability.
Furthermore, legislative and regulatory initiatives related to climate change have the potential to disrupt the business and result in operational changes and expenditures that could significantly impact the business and the operations and creditworthiness of the Company’s clients and also increase the compliance burden on the Company.
Negative public opinion could damage the Company’s reputation and adversely affect its earnings. 
   Reputational risk, or the risk to earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in the business. Negative public opinion can result from the actual or perceived manner in which the Company conducts its business activities; management of actual or potential conflicts of interest and ethical issues; protection of confidential client information; and public scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance issues. The Company’s brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that it contracts with to provide services to the extent such parties fail to meet their contractual, legal and regulatory obligations or act in a manner that is harmful to clients. If the Company fails to supervise these relationships effectively, it could also be subject to regulatory enforcement, including fines and penalties. Negative public opinion can adversely affect the Company’s ability to keep and attract clients and can expose it to litigation and regulatory action. The Company takes steps to minimize reputation risk, but its efforts may not be sufficient.
Risks Relating to Company Securities
The Company’s stock price can be volatile.    
Stock price volatility may make it more difficult to resell or buy common stock. The stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things: 
•
actual or anticipated variations in quarterly and annual results of operations;
•
changes in recommendations by securities analysts;
•
changes in composition and perceptions of the investors who own the Company’s stock and other securities;
•
changes in ratings from national rating agencies on publicly or privately-owned debt securities and deposits in the Bank;
•
operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to the Company;
•
news reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry, including regulatory actions against other financial institutions;
•
actual or expected economic conditions that are perceived to affect the Company such as changes in commodity prices, real estate values or interest rates;
•
perceptions in the marketplace regarding the Company or its competitors;
•
new technology used, or services offered, by competitors;
•
significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving the Company or competitors;
•
changes in government regulations and interpretation of those regulations, changes in practices requested or required by regulators and changes in regulatory enforcement focus; and
•
geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.
General market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends, could also cause the Company’s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.
28
Additionally, the trading volume in the Company’s common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies. Given the lower trading volume of the common stock, significant sales of the common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could increase the volatility of the Company’s stock price and cause the stock price to fall.
The holders of the Company’s indebtedness and preferred stock have rights that are senior to those of its common stockholders
.    As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $375.0 million in outstanding subordinated notes issued by the holding company, $175.0 million in outstanding subordinated notes issued by the Bank, and $113.4 million in outstanding junior subordinated notes that are held by statutory trusts which issued trust preferred securities to investors. Payments of the principal and interest on trust preferred securities are conditionally guaranteed to the extent not paid by each trust, provided the trust has funds available for such obligations.
The Company’s subordinated notes and junior subordinated notes are senior to the shares of preferred stock and common stock in right of payment of dividends and other distributions. The Company must be current on interest and principal payments on its indebtedness before any dividends can be paid on its preferred stock or its common stock. In the event of bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the Company’s indebtedness must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to preferred or common stockholders.  If certain conditions are met, the Company has the right to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities) at any time or from time to time for a period not to exceed 20 consecutive quarters in a deferral period, during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of preferred stock or common stock. Because the Bank’s subordinated notes are obligations of the Bank, they would, in liquidation of the Bank or sale of its assets, receive payment before any amounts would be payable to holders of the Company’s common stock, preferred stock or subordinated notes.
At December 31, 2024, the Company had issued and outstanding 300,000 shares of 5.75% fixed rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series B, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) and 12 million depositary shares, each representing 1/40th interest in a share of the Series B preferred stock. The preferred stock is senior to the shares of common stock in right of payment of dividends and other distributions. The Company must be current on dividends payable to holders of preferred stock before any dividends can be paid on the common stock. In the event of the Company’s bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of preferred stock must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to common stockholders.
Federal legislation and regulations impose restriction on the ownership of the Company’s common stock
.    The ability of a third party to acquire the Company is limited under applicable U.S. banking laws and regulations. The BHCA requires any bank holding company (as defined therein) to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock. Any “company” (as defined in the BHCA) other than a bank holding company would be required to obtain Federal Reserve approval before acquiring “control” of the Company. “Control” generally means (i) the ownership or control of 25% or more of a class of voting securities, (ii) the ability to elect a majority of the directors or (iii) the ability otherwise to exercise a controlling influence over management and policies. A holder of 25% or more of outstanding voting common stock, other than an individual, is subject to regulation and supervision as a bank holding company under the BHCA. In addition, under the CIBC Act and the Federal Reserve’s regulations thereunder, any person, either individually or acting through or in concert with one or more persons, is required to provide notice to the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the Company’s outstanding voting common stock.
Anti-takeover provisions of the Company’s certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law may make it more difficult for holders to receive a change in control premium
.    Certain provisions of the Company’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest more difficult, even if such events were perceived by many stockholders as beneficial to their interests. These provisions include advance notice for nominations of directors and stockholders' proposals, and authority to issue “blank check” preferred stock with such designations, rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s board of directors. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, the Company is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, in general, prevents an interested stockholder, defined generally as a person owning 15% or more of a corporation's outstanding voting stock, from engaging in a business combination with the Company for three years following the date that person became an interested stockholder unless certain specified conditions are satisfied.

CYBERSECURITY
Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy
Cybersecurity risks are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly pervasive across all industries. To mitigate these risks and protect sensitive customer data, financial transactions and the Company’s information systems, 
the Company has 
29
implemented a comprehensive cybersecurity risk management program
, which is a component of its overarching enterprise risk management program. Key components of the cybersecurity risk management program include:
•
A risk assessment process that identifies and prioritizes material cybersecurity risks; defines and evaluates the effectiveness of controls to mitigate the risks; and reports results to executive management and the Board of Directors.
•
A third-party Managed Detection and Response (“MDR”) service, which monitors the security of the Company’s information systems around-the-clock, including intrusion detection and alerting.
•
A dedicated cybersecurity team covering all critical cyber defense functions such as engineering, data protection, identity and access management, insider risk management, security operations, threat emulation and threat intelligence.
•
A training program that educates employees about cybersecurity risks and how to protect themselves from cyberattacks.
•
An awareness program that keeps employees informed about cybersecurity threats and how to stay safe online. 
•
An incident response plan that outlines the steps the Company will take to respond to a cybersecurity incident, which is tested on a periodic basis.
The Company engages reputable third-party assessors to conduct various independent risk assessments on a regular basis, including but not limited to maturity assessments and various testing. Following a defense-in-depth strategy, the Company leverages both in-house resources and third-party service providers to implement and maintain processes and controls to manage the identified risks.
The Company’s Third-Party Risk Management program is designed to ensure that its vendors meet its cybersecurity requirements. This includes conducting periodic risk assessments of vendors, requiring vendors to implement appropriate cybersecurity controls and monitoring vendor compliance with the Company’s cybersecurity requirements.
The Company’s cybersecurity risk management program and strategy are designed to ensure the company's information and information systems are appropriately protected from a variety of threats, both natural and man-made. Periodic risk assessments are performed to validate control requirements and ensure that the Company’s information is protected at a level commensurate with its sensitivity, value, and criticality. Preventative and detective security controls are employed on all media where information is stored, the systems that process it, and infrastructure components that facilitate its transmission to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Company information. These controls include, but are not limited to access control, data encryption, data loss prevention, incident response, security monitoring, third party risk management, and vulnerability management.
The Company's cybersecurity risk management program and strategy are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure that they are aligned with the Company's business objectives and are designed to address evolving cybersecurity threats and satisfy regulatory requirements and industry standards.
Material Effects of Cybersecurity Threats
While cybersecurity risks have the potential to materially affect the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations, the Company does not believe that risks from cybersecurity threats or attacks, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected the Company, including its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.
 However, the sophistication of cyber threats continues to increase, and the Company’s cybersecurity risk management and strategy may be insufficient or may not be successful in protecting against all cyber incidents. Accordingly, no matter how well designed or implemented the Company’s controls are, it will not be able to anticipate all cyber security breaches, and it may not be able to implement effective preventive measures against such security breaches in a timely manner. For more information on how cybersecurity risk may materially affect the Company’s business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, please refer to
