ITEM 1A.     
RISK FACTORS
The Company is subject to risk. The following discussion, along with management’s discussion and analysis and the financial statements and footnotes, sets forth the most significant risks and uncertainties that management believes could adversely affect the business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently deems immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or results of operations. There is no assurance that this discussion covers all potential risks that the Company faces. The occurrence of the described risks could cause results to differ materially from those described in its forward-looking statements included elsewhere in this report or in other filings with the SEC, and could have a material adverse impact on the business, financial condition or results of operations.

Risk Factors Associated with the Business
Credit Risks
The Company must effectively manage its credit risks
.    The risk of non-payment of loans is inherent in commercial banking, which may result from many factors, including:
•
Adverse changes in local, U.S. and global economic and industry conditions, and other geopolitical events;
•
Declines in the value of collateral, including asset values that are directly or indirectly related to external factors such as commodity prices, real estate values, interest rates or geopolitical risks;
•
Concentrations of credit associated with specific loan categories, industries or collateral types; and
•
Exposures to individual borrowers and to groups of entities that may be affiliated on some basis that individually and/or collectively represent a larger percentage of the Company’s total loans or capital than might be considered common at other banks of similar size.
The Company relies heavily on information provided by third parties when originating and monitoring loans.  If this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and the Company does not detect such misrepresentations, the credit risk associated with the transaction may be increased.  Although the Company attempts to manage its credit risk by carefully monitoring the concentration of its loans within specific loan categories and industries and through prudent loan approval and monitoring practices in all categories of lending, the Company cannot assure that its approval and monitoring procedures will reduce these lending risks. The Company’s significant number of large credit relationships (above $20 million) could exacerbate credit problems precipitated by a regional or national economic downturn. Competitive pressures could erode underwriting standards, leading to a decline in general credit quality and increases in credit defaults and non-performing asset levels.  If the Company’s credit portfolio management routines, policies and procedures are not able to adequately adapt to 
16
changes in economic, competitive or other conditions that affect customers and the quality of the loan portfolio, the Company may incur increased losses that could adversely affect its financial results and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, restrictions on its lending activity or financial penalties.
A significant portion of the Company’s assets consists of commercial loans, which may involve a higher degree of credit risk.    
The Company generally invests a greater proportion of its assets in commercial loans to business customers than other banking institutions of its size, and its business plan calls for continued efforts to increase its assets invested in these loans. Commercial loans may involve a higher degree of credit risk than other types of loans due, in part, to their larger average size, the effects of changing economic conditions on the businesses of the Company’s commercial loan customers, the dependence of borrowers and counterparties on operating cash flow to service debt and the Company’s reliance upon collateral which may not be readily marketable. Due to the greater proportion of these commercial loans in its portfolio and because the balances of these loans are, on average, larger than other categories of loans, losses incurred on a relatively small number of commercial loans could have a materially adverse impact on results of operations and financial condition.
The Company is subject to risks arising from conditions in the real estate market, as a significant portion of its loans are secured by commercial and residential real estate
.    The Company’s real estate lending activities and its exposure to fluctuations in real estate collateral values are significant and may increase as its assets increase. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a relatively short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located, in response to factors such as economic downturns, changes in the economic health of industries heavily concentrated in a particular area and in response to changes in market interest rates, which influence capitalization rates used to value revenue-generating commercial real estate. If the value of real estate serving as collateral for loans declines materially, a significant part of the loan portfolio could become under-collateralized and losses incurred upon borrower defaults would increase. Conditions in certain segments of the real estate industry, including homebuilding, lot development and mortgage lending, may have an effect on the values of real estate pledged as collateral for loans. The inability of purchasers of real estate, including residential real estate, to obtain financing may weaken the financial condition of borrowers who are dependent on the sale or refinancing of property to repay their loans. Changes in the economic health of certain industries can have a significant impact on other sectors or industries which are directly or indirectly associated with those industries and may impact the value of real estate in areas where such industries are concentrated.
Future profitability depends, to a significant extent, upon commercial business customers
.    The Company’s future profitability depends, to a significant extent, upon revenue it receives from commercial business customers, and their ability to continue to meet their loan obligations. Adverse economic conditions or other factors affecting this market segment, and the Company’s failure to timely identify and react to unexpected economic downturns, may have a greater adverse effect than other financial institutions that have a more diversified customer base.  Additionally, the Company’s inability to grow its commercial business customer base in a highly competitive market could affect its future growth and profitability.
The Company’s business is concentrated in Texas and exposure to the Texas economy, including the energy industry, could adversely affect its performance
.    Although more than 50% of the Company’s loan exposure is outside of Texas and more than 50% of its deposits are sourced outside of Texas, the Texas concentration remains significant compared to peer banks. A majority of the loans held for investment, excluding mortgage finance loans and other national lines of business, are to businesses with headquarters or operations in Texas. As a result, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations may be strongly affected by any prolonged period of economic recession or other adverse business, economic or regulatory conditions affecting Texas businesses and financial institutions. Furthermore, while the Texas economy is increasingly more diversified, the energy sector and related industries continue to play an important role in the overall Texas economy and represent a significant part of the economies in some of the primary markets in which the Company operates. The Company’s portfolio of energy loans consists primarily of producing reserve-based loans to exploration and production companies, with a smaller portion of loan balances attributable to royalty owners, midstream operators, saltwater disposal and other service companies whose businesses primarily relate to production, not exploration and development, of oil and gas. These businesses are significantly affected by volatility in oil and natural gas prices, reserve depletion curves, material declines in the level of drilling and production activity in Texas and in other areas of the United States and material fluctuations in investor interest in oil and gas exploration and production investments. There is no assurance that the Company will not be materially adversely impacted by the direct and indirect effects of current and future economic conditions in Texas.
The Company must effectively manage its counterparty risk
.    Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other financial market participants. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company’s credit risk may be increased when the collateral securing its loans cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of its credit or derivative exposure. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or profitability.
17
The Company must maintain an appropriate allowance for credit losses
.    Management’s experience in the banking industry indicates that some portion of the Company’s loans will become delinquent, and some may only be partially repaid or may never be repaid at all. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses on loans, which is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense each quarter, that is consistent with management’s assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio in light of the amount of loans committed and outstanding and current and future economic conditions and market trends. When specific loan losses are identified, the amount of the expected loss is removed, or charged off, from the allowance.  Management’s methodology for establishing the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on loans depends on subjective application of risk grades as indicators of each borrower’s ability to repay specific loans, together with an assessment of how actual or projected changes in competitor underwriting practices, competition for borrowers and depositors and other conditions in markets are likely to impact improvement or deterioration in the collectability of loans as compared to historical experience.
The Company has a substantially larger percentage of commercial, real estate and other categories of business loans relative to total assets than most other banks in the market and individual loans are generally larger as a percentage of the Company’s total earning assets than other banks. As a result, the Company’s business model may make it more vulnerable to changes in the underlying business credit quality than other entities with which the Company competes. The failure to maintain above-peer credit quality metrics could have a material adverse impact on growth and profitability. 
If management’s assessment of inherent risk and losses in the loan portfolio is inaccurate, or geopolitical, economic and market conditions or borrowers' financial performance experience material unanticipated changes, the allowance may become inadequate, requiring larger provisions for loan losses that can materially decrease the Company’s earnings or profitability. Federal regulators periodically review the Company’s allowance for credit losses and based on their judgments or interpretations, which may be different than management’s, may require the Company to change classifications or grades of loans, increase the allowance for credit losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in the allowance for credit losses or in the amount of loan charge-offs required by the Company’s methodology or regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on results of operations and financial condition.
Changes in accounting standards could materially affect how the Company reports its financial results.  
  The Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC may change the financial accounting and reporting standards, or the interpretation of those standards, that govern the preparation of the Company’s external financial statements from time to time. The impact of these changes or the application thereof on the Company’s financial condition and operations can be difficult to predict.
Liquidity Risks
The company must effectively manage its liquidity risk
.    The Company requires liquidity in the form of available funds to meet deposit, debt and other obligations as they come due, borrower requests to draw on committed credit facilities including unexpected demands for cash payments. While neither the Company nor the Bank is subject to Basel III liquidity regulations, the adequacy of its liquidity is a matter of regulatory interest given the significant portion of the balance sheet represented by loans as opposed to securities and other more marketable investments. The Company’s principal source of funding consists of customer deposits, supplemented by its short-term and long-term borrowings, including federal funds purchased and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) borrowings. Recently proposed changes to the FHLB system could adversely impact the Company’s access to FHLB borrowings or increase the cost of such borrowings. The Company also relies on the availability of the mortgage secondary market provided by Ginnie Mae and the government sponsored entities (“GSEs”) to support the liquidity of its residential mortgage assets. A substantial majority of the Company’s liabilities consist of demand, savings, checking and money market deposits, which are payable on demand or upon relatively short notice.  By comparison, a substantial portion of the assets are loans, most of which, excluding mortgage finance loans, cannot be collected or sold in so short a time frame, creating the potential for an imbalance in the availability of liquid assets to satisfy depositors and loan funding requirements.
An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of securities and loans and other sources, or an inability to access the capital markets, could have a substantial negative effect on the Company’s liquidity. Furthermore, such funding sources even if available could become more expensive, which could negatively impact the Company’s profitability and net interest margin. The Company actively manages its available sources of funds to meet expected or anticipated needs under normal and financially stressed conditions, but there is no assurance that the Company will be able to make new loans, meet ongoing funding commitments to borrowers, or replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary under all possible circumstances. The Company’s ability to obtain funding, including on attractive terms, could be impaired by factors beyond its control, such as disruptions in financial markets, negative expectations regarding the financial services industry generally or in the markets or negative perceptions of the Company, including credit ratings.
The Company sources a significant volume of its non-interest bearing deposits from its commercial clients, creating concentrations of deposits that may carry a greater risk of unexpected material withdrawals. These customers are more likely to actively monitor the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and could withdraw their deposits quickly upon the occurrence of a material adverse development affecting the Company or its businesses or based on market rumors regarding 
18
the Company or other regional banks. In response to this risk, the Company has increased its liquidity and developed techniques for monitoring and planning for changes in liquidity and capital, but there is no assurance that the Company will maintain or have access to sufficient funding and capital to fully mitigate its liquidity risk.
One potential source of liquidity for the Company are brokered deposits arranged by brokers acting as intermediaries, typically larger money-center financial institutions. The Company receives these deposits from certain of its customers in connection with its delivery of other financial services to them or their customers. The deposits are subject to regulatory classification as brokered deposits, which are generally considered to be more sensitive to interest rates, with a higher withdrawal than other deposits if the rates offered are not competitive with rates offered by the Bank’s competitors. Furthermore, banks with higher levels of brokered deposits may be viewed as having higher liquidity risks, which may lead to further deposit outflow. 
If the Bank does not maintain regulatory capital above the level required to be well capitalized the Bank would be required to obtain FDIC consent for it to continue to accept, renew or roll over most deposits classified as brokered deposits, and there can be no assurance that the FDIC would consent under any circumstances. The Bank could also be required to suspend or eliminate deposit gathering from any source classified as brokered deposits. The FDIC can change the definition of brokered deposits or extend the classification to deposits not currently classified as brokered deposits and the FDIC has proposed rules that would reclassify certain deposits as brokered deposits.  These non-traditional deposits are subject to greater operational and reputational risk of unexpected withdrawal than traditional demand and time deposits, particularly those provided by consumers.
The Company’s growth plans are dependent on the availability of capital and funding
.    The Company’s historical ability to raise capital through the sale of capital stock and debt securities may be affected by economic and market conditions or regulatory changes that are beyond its control. Adverse changes in its operating performance or financial condition could make raising additional capital difficult or more expensive or limit access to customary sources of funding, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas (“Reserve Bank”) or the FHLB.  Unexpected changes in requirements for capital resulting from regulatory actions could require the Company to raise capital at a time, and at a price, that might be unfavorable, or could require that the Company forego continuing growth or reduce its then current loan portfolio. The Company cannot offer assurance that capital and funding will be available to it in the future, in needed amounts, upon acceptable terms or at all. The Company’s efforts to raise capital could require the issuance of securities at times and with maturities, conditions and rates that are disadvantageous, and which could have a dilutive impact on its then or current stockholders.  Factors that could adversely affect the Company’s ability to raise additional capital or necessary funding include conditions in the capital markets, its financial performance, its credit ratings, regulatory actions and general economic conditions.  Increases in cost of capital, including dilution and increased interest or dividend requirements, could have a direct adverse impact on the Company’s operating performance and its ability to achieve its growth objectives.
The Company’s mortgage finance business has experienced, and will likely continue to experience, highly variable usage of the Company’s funding capacity resulting from seasonal demands for credit, changes in consumer demand driven by changes in interest rates, housing affordability and supply and month-end “spikes” of residential mortgage closings. These spikes could also result in the Company and the Bank having capital ratios that are below internally targeted levels or even levels that could cause the Bank to not be well capitalized and could affect liquidity levels.  At the same time, managing this risk by declining to respond fully to the needs of customers could severely impact the business. The Company has historically responded to these variable funding demands by, among other things, increasing the extent of participations sold in its mortgage loan interests, as needed, and by maintaining a substantial borrowing relationship with the FHLB. Its mortgage finance customers have also provided significant deposit balances associated with the borrower escrow accounts created at the time certain mortgage loans are funded, which have benefited liquidity and net interest margin. In response to competitive pressures, the Company sometimes finds it necessary to pay interest on some of these accounts, as regulations allow or require and this trend may continue, which can affect its costs of funds.  Individual escrow account balances also experience significant variability monthly as principal and interest payments, including ad valorem taxes and insurance premiums, are paid periodically. While the short average holding period of its mortgage interests of approximately 20 days will allow the Company, if necessitated by a funding shortfall, to rapidly decrease the size of the portfolio and its associated capital and funding requirements, any such action might significantly damage the business and important mortgage finance relationships.
The Company is dependent on funds obtained from borrowing or capital transactions or from the Bank to fund its obligations.    
The Company is a financial holding company engaged in the business of managing, controlling and operating the Bank. The Company conducts no material business or other activity at the parent company level other than activities incidental to holding equity and debt investments in the Bank. As a result, the Company relies on the proceeds of capital transactions, borrowings under its revolving line of credit and payments of interest and principal on loans made to the Bank to pay its operating expenses, to satisfy its obligations to debt holders and to pay dividends on its preferred stock. The profitability of the Bank is subject to fluctuation based upon, among other things, the cost and availability of funds, changes in interest rates and economic conditions in general. The Bank’s ability to pay dividends to the Company is subject to regulatory limitations that can, under certain adverse circumstances, prohibit the payment of dividends to it. The Company’s right to participate in any distribution from the liquidation or sale of the Bank’s assets is subject to the prior claims of the Bank’s creditors.
19
If the Company is unable to access funds from capital transactions, borrowing under its revolving line of credit or dividends or interest on loan payments from the Bank, the Company may be unable to satisfy its obligations to creditors or debtholders or pay dividends on its preferred stock.
Market Risks
The Company must effectively manage its interest rate risk
.    The Company’s profitability is dependent to a large extent on its net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income paid on its loans and investments and the interest the Company pays to third parties such as its depositors, lenders and debtholders. Periods of volatile interest rates may have a material effect on the Company’s earnings. Changes in interest rates can impact profits and the fair values of certain assets and liabilities. Models that the Company uses to forecast and plan for the impact of rising and falling interest rates may be incorrect or fail to consider the impact of competition and other conditions affecting loans and deposits.
Interest rate risk can also result from mismatches between the dollar amounts of repricing or maturing assets and liabilities and from mismatches in the timing and rates at which the assets and liabilities reprice. The Company actively monitors and manages the balances of maturing and repricing assets and liabilities to reduce the adverse impact of changes in interest rates, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to avoid material adverse effects on net interest margin in all market conditions.
Rising interest rates in prior periods have increased interest expense, with a commensurate positive effect on net interest income; however, interest rates have begun to decrease following three cuts to the Federal Funds rate by the Federal Reserve in 2024. Rapid and unexpected volatility in interest rates creates additional uncertainty and potential for adverse financial effects. There can be no assurance that the Company will not be materially adversely affected by future changes in interest rates.
The company must effectively manage market risk associated primarily with sales and trading activities.
    In addition to interest rate risk, the Company is exposed to market risk, principally related to trading activities conducted to support customer transactions or to provide customers with liquidity. The Company typically seeks to manage the market risks of its positions with offsetting positions that eliminate or reduce market risk to fall within acceptable tolerances.
The Company uses VaR as a primary risk measure to aggregate, monitor and limit risks at the portfolio level across all trading activities. VaR is calculated based on one year historical moves in key market risk factors relevant to the financial asset and any associated portfolio and estimates potential loss on subject positions at 95th percentile confidence interval.
Changes in interest rates affect the value of the Company’s securities portfolio, and the Company may realize losses if it were to sell such securities at a time when interest rates are higher than the yield on the Company’s securities portfolio.
    As a result of inflationary pressures and the resulting rapid increases in interest rates in prior periods, the trading value of previously issued government and other fixed income securities declined significantly. These securities make up a majority of the securities portfolio of most banks in the U.S., including the Company’s, resulting in unrealized losses embedded in U.S. banks’ securities portfolios. If the Company were to sell securities with embedded unrealized losses, as the Company did in the third quarter of 2024, it may incur losses, which could impair the Company’s capital, financial condition, and results of operations and require the Company to raise additional capital on unfavorable terms, thereby negatively impacting its profitability. While the Company has taken actions to maximize its funding sources, there is no guarantee that such actions will be successful or sufficient in the event of sudden liquidity needs.
Strategic Risks
The Company competes with many banks and other traditional, non-traditional, brick and mortar and online financial service providers
.    Competition among providers of financial services in markets, in Texas, regionally and nationally, is intense. The Company competes with other financial and bank holding companies, state and national commercial banks, savings and loan associations, consumer finance companies, credit unions, securities brokerages, insurance companies, mortgage banking companies, money market mutual funds, asset-based non-bank lenders, government sponsored or subsidized lenders, financial technology companies and other financial services providers. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources, lending limits and technological resources and larger branch networks than the Company does and are able to offer a broader range of products and services than the Company can. Many competitors offer lower interest rates and more liberal loan terms that appeal to borrowers but adversely affect net interest margin and assurance of repayment. The Company is increasingly faced with competition in many of its products and services by non-bank providers who may have competitive advantages of size, access to potential customers and fewer regulatory requirements. Failure to compete effectively for deposit, loan and other banking customers in any of the lines of business could cause the Company to lose market share, slow or reverse growth rate or suffer adverse effects on financial condition, results of operations or profitability. See the discussion above in
