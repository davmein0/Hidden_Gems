Year ended December 31, 2024 compared to year ended December 31, 2023
The Company reported net income of $77.5 million and net income available to common stockholders of $60.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to net income of $189.1 million and net income available to common stockholders of $171.9 million for the same period in 2023. On a fully diluted basis, earnings per common share was $1.28 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $3.54 for the same period in 2023. ROE was 2.04% and ROA was 0.25% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 6.15% and 0.64%, respectively, for the same period in 2023. The decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 resulted primarily from a decrease in non-interest income, primarily as a result of the $179.6 million loss on sale of available-for-sale debt securities recognized during the third quarter of 2024 in connection with strategic balance sheet repositioning undertaken by the Company.
Details of the changes in the various components of net income are discussed below.

Net Interest Income
Net interest income was $901.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $914.1 million for 2023. The decrease was primarily due to increases in average interest bearing liabilities and deposit costs, partially offset by increases in average earning assets and yields on average earning assets.
Average earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $1.0 billion compared to the same period in 2023, which included increases of $1.2 billion in average total loans and $223.5 million in average investment securities, partially offset by a $413.3 million decrease in average interest bearing cash and cash equivalents. Average interest bearing liabilities increased $1.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to a $2.2 billion increase in average interest bearing deposits, partially offset by decreases of $389.1 million in average short-term borrowings and $143.8 million in average long-term debt. Average non-interest bearing deposits for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased to $9.0 billion from $9.8 billion for the same period in 2023.
Net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 3.03% compared to 3.17% for 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in interest bearing deposit yields, partially offset by higher yields on investment securities compared to the same period in 2023.
The yield on total loans held for investment, net, of 6.52% for the year ended December 31, 2024 was unchanged compared to the same period in 2023 and the yield on earning assets increased to 5.82% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 5.65% for the same period in 2023. The average cost of total deposits increased to 2.93% for 2024 from 2.47% for the same period in 2023 and total funding costs, including all deposits, long-term debt and stockholders' equity, increased to 2.75% for 2024 compared to 2.46% for the same period 2023.

FDIC insurance assessment included a $2.8 million special assessment expense in 2024, as compared to a $19.9 million special assessment expense in 2023.

Total loans held for investment were $22.5 billion at December 31, 2024, an increase of $2.1 billion from December 31, 2023. The Company experienced loan growth in all loan categories as it has continued to execute on its long-term strategy. Commercial loan growth includes the impact of the acquisition of a $332.0 million loan portfolio completed during the third 
37
quarter of 2024. Mortgage finance loans include legal ownership interests in mortgage loans that the Company purchases from unaffiliated mortgage originators, either directly or through a special purpose entity structure, that are typically sold within 10 to 20 days and represent 23% and 19% of gross loans held for investment at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Volumes fluctuate based on the level of market demand for the product and the number of days between purchase and sale of the loans, which can be affected by changes in overall market interest rates, and tend to peak at the end of each month. 
The Company originates a substantial majority of all loans held for investment. The Company also participates in shared national credits, both as a participant and as an agent. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $5.7 billion in shared national credits, $1.1 billion of which the Company administered as agent. All syndicated loans, whether the Company acts as agent or participant, are underwritten to the same standards as all other loans the Company originates. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $34.7 million of the Company’s shared national credits were on non-accrual.
Portfolio Concentrations
Although more than 50% of the Company’s total loan exposure is outside of Texas and more than 50% of deposits are sourced outside of Texas, Texas concentration remains significant. As of December 31, 2024, a majority of the loans held for investment, excluding mortgage finance and other national lines of business, were to businesses with headquarters or operations in Texas. This geographic concentration subjects the Company’s loan portfolio to the general economic conditions within this state. The risks created by this concentration have been considered by management in determining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses.

As noted in the tables above, approximately 25% of loans held for investment as of December 31, 2024 are commercial real estate loans that are generally secured by real property. The commercial real estate portfolio is comprised primarily of non-owner occupied construction/development financing and limited term financing provided to professional real estate developers, owners/managers of commercial real estate projects and properties, and residential builders/developers. Collateral properties include office buildings, warehouse/distribution buildings, shopping centers, hotels/motels, senior living, apartment buildings, residential and commercial tract developments, and raw land or lots to be developed into single-family homes. The primary source of repayment on these loans is generally expected to come from the sale, permanent financing or lease of the real property collateral. As a result, the performance of these loans is generally impacted by fluctuations in collateral values, the ability of the borrower to obtain permanent financing, and, in the case of loans to residential builder/developers, volatility in consumer demand.

The determination of collateral value is critically important when financing real estate. As a result, obtaining current and objectively prepared appraisals is a major part of the underwriting and monitoring processes. The Company engages a variety of professional firms to supply appraisals, market studies and feasibility reports, environmental assessments and project site inspections to complement its internal resources to underwrite and monitor these credit exposures. Generally, the credit policy requires a new appraisal every three years. However, in periods of economic uncertainty where real estate market conditions may change rapidly, more current appraisals are obtained when warranted by conditions such as a borrower’s deteriorating financial condition, their possible inability to perform on the loan or other indicators of increasing risk of reliance on collateral value as the sole source of repayment of the loan. Annual appraisals are generally obtained for loans graded substandard or worse where real estate is a material portion of the collateral value and/or the income from the real estate or sale of the real estate is the primary source of debt service.
Appraisals are, in substantially all cases, reviewed by a third party to determine the reasonableness of the appraised value. The third-party reviewer will challenge whether or not the data used is appropriate and relevant, form an opinion as to the appropriateness of the appraisal methods and techniques used, and determine if overall the analysis and conclusions of the appraiser can be relied upon. Additionally, the third-party reviewer provides a detailed report of that analysis. Further review may be conducted by credit officers, including the Bank’s managed asset committee as conditions warrant. These additional steps of review are undertaken to confirm that the underlying appraisal and the third-party analysis can be relied upon. If differences arise, management addresses those with the reviewer and determines an appropriate resolution. Both the appraisal process and the appraisal review process can be less reliable in establishing accurate collateral values during and following periods of economic weakness due to the lack of comparable sales and the limited availability of financing to support an active market of potential purchasers.
Interest Reserve Loans
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had $797.3 million and $788.9 million, respectively, in loans held for investment that included interest reserve arrangements, representing approximately 6% and 14%, respectively, of outstanding commercial real estate loans. The use of interest reserves is common in construction loans and is carefully controlled by underwriting standards, which consider the feasibility of the project, the creditworthiness of the borrower and guarantors and the loan-to-value coverage of the collateral. The interest reserve allows the borrower to draw loan funds to pay interest charges on the outstanding balance of the loan when financial condition precedents are met. When drawn, the interest is capitalized and added to the loan balance, subject to conditions specified during the initial underwriting and at the time the credit is approved. The Company has ongoing controls for monitoring compliance with loan covenants, advancing funds and determining default conditions.
When the Company finances land on which improvements will be constructed, construction funds are generally not advanced until the borrower has received lease or purchase commitments which will meet cash flow coverage requirements and/or an analysis of market conditions and project feasibility indicates to management’s satisfaction that such lease or purchase commitments are forthcoming or other sources of repayment have been identified to repay the loan. It is the general policy to require a substantial equity investment by the borrower to complement the Bank's credit commitment. Any such required borrower investment is first contributed and invested in the project before any draws are allowed under the Bank's credit commitment. The Company requires current financial statements of the borrowing entity and guarantors, as well as conduct periodic inspections of the project and analysis of whether the project is on schedule or delayed. Updated appraisals are ordered when necessary to validate the collateral values to support advances, including reserve interest. Advances of interest reserves are discontinued if collateral values do not support the advances or if the borrower does not comply with other terms and conditions in the loan agreements. If at any time management believes that the collateral position is jeopardized, the Company 
40
retains the right to stop the use of interest reserves. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, none of the loans with interest reserves were on non-accrual.
Large Credit Relationships
The Company originates and maintains large credit relationships with numerous customers in the ordinary course of business. The legal lending limit of the Bank is approximately $595.2 million. The Company, however, generally employs lower house limits which vary by assigned risk grade, product and collateral type. Such house limits, which generally range from $20 million to $60 million, may be exceeded with appropriate authorization for exceptionally strong borrowers and otherwise where business opportunity and assessed credit risk warrant a somewhat larger investment. The Company considers large credit relationships to be those with commitments equal to or in excess of $20.0 million.

Deposits
The Company competes for deposits by offering a full suite of deposit products and services to its customers. While this includes offering competitive interest rates and fees, the primary means of competing for deposits is convenience and service to customers, tailored to the strategy of maintaining a branch-lite network. The Company offers banking centers, courier services and online and mobile banking. Bask Bank, the Bank’s digital-only online banking division, serves customers on a 24 hours-a-day, 7 days-a-week basis solely through online banking.
Average total deposits for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $1.4 billion compared to 2023. Average non-interest bearing deposits for the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased $801.5 million compared to 2023 and average interest bearing deposits increased $2.2 billion compared to 2023. The average cost of total deposits increased to 2.93% in 2024 from 2.47% in 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Liquidity
In general terms, liquidity is a measurement of the Company’s ability to meet its cash needs. The Company’s objectives in managing its liquidity are to maintain the ability to meet loan commitments, repurchase investment securities and repay deposits and other liabilities in accordance with their terms, without an adverse impact on current or future earnings. The Company’s liquidity strategy is guided by policies, formulated and monitored by senior management and the Asset and Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”), which take into account the demonstrated marketability of the Company’s assets, the sources and stability of its funding and the level of unfunded commitments. The Company regularly evaluates all of its various funding sources with an emphasis on accessibility, stability, reliability and cost-effectiveness. The Company’s principal source of funding is customer deposits, supplemented by short-term borrowings, primarily from federal funds purchased and Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) borrowings, which are generally used to fund mortgage finance loans, and long-term debt. The Company also relies on the availability of the mortgage secondary market provided by Ginnie Mae and government sponsored entities to support the liquidity of mortgage finance loans.
