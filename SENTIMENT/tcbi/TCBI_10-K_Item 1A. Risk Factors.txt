Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Periodically, based on market conditions and other factors, and subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations and the terms of its existing indebtedness, the Company may repay, repurchase, exchange or redeem outstanding indebtedness, or otherwise enter into transactions regarding debt or capital structure. For example, the Company periodically evaluates and may engage in liability management transactions, including repurchases or redemptions of outstanding subordinated notes, which may be funded by the issuance of, or exchanges of, newly issued unsecured borrowings to actively manage the debt maturity profile and interest cost.
Capital Resources
The Company’s equity capital averaged $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 
$3.1 billion 
for the same period in 2023. The Company has not paid any cash dividends on common stock since operations commenced and has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future.
On January 17, 2024, the Company’s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under which the Company could repurchase up to $150.0 million in shares of its outstanding common stock, excluding the effect of excise tax expense incurred on net stock repurchases. Remaining repurchase authorization under the January 18, 2023 share repurchase program was terminated upon authorization of this new program. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 1,381,436 shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price, including excise tax expense, of $81.5 million, at a weighted average price of $58.57 per share.
45
On January 22, 2025, the Company’s board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $200.0 million in shares of its outstanding common stock, excluding the effect of excise tax expense incurred on net stock repurchases. The share repurchase program expires on January 31, 2026, but may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Remaining repurchase authorization under the January 17, 2024 share repurchase program was terminated upon authorization of this new program.
Any repurchases under the Company’s repurchase program will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws from time to time in open market or private transactions. The extent to which the Company repurchases shares, and the timing of such repurchases, will be at management’s discretion and will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, the Company’s capital position and amount of retained earnings, regulatory requirements and other considerations.
For additional information on the Company’s capital and stockholders’ equity, see Note 10 - Regulatory Ratios and Capital, in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Critical Accounting Estimates
SEC guidance requires disclosure of “critical accounting estimates.” The SEC defines “critical accounting estimates” as those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant.
The Company follows financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The more significant of these policies are summarized in Note 1 - Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Not all significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. However, the policy noted below could be deemed to meet the SEC’s definition of a critical accounting estimate.
Allowance for Credit Losses
Management considers the policies related to the allowance for credit losses as the most critical to the financial statement presentation. The total allowance for credit losses includes activity related to allowances calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 326, 
Credit Losses
. The allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for credit losses charged to current earnings. The amount maintained in the allowance reflects management’s continuing evaluation of the credit losses expected to be recognized over the life of the loans in the Company’s portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on loans is a valuation account that is deducted from the loans' amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet financial instruments is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses, the loan portfolio is segregated into pools first by portfolio segment and then by past due status or credit grade. Each pool is assigned a loss estimate, reflecting historical loss rates that incorporate probability of default and severity of losses over the estimated remaining life of the loans. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis and are not included in the collective (pool) evaluation. Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Modifications to loss estimates are made to incorporate a reasonable and supportable forecast of future losses at the pool level, as well as any necessary qualitative adjustments using a Portfolio Level Qualitative Factor (“PLQF”) and/or a Portfolio Segment Level Qualitative Factor (“SLQF”). A similar process is employed to calculate a reserve assigned to off-balance sheet financial instruments, specifically unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit.  Modified loss estimates are assigned based on the balance of the commitments estimated to be outstanding at the time of default. The PLQF and SLQF are utilized to address factors that are not present in historical loss rates and are otherwise unaccounted for in the quantitative process. A reserve is recorded upon origination or purchase of a loan. See 
“Summary of Credit Loss Experience”
 above and Note 4 - Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of the risk factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses.
Management considers a range of macroeconomic scenarios in connection with the allowance estimation process. Within the various economic scenarios considered as of December 31, 2024, the quantitative estimate of the allowance for credit loss would increase by approximately $139.6 million under sole consideration of the most severe downside scenario. The quoted sensitivity calculation reflects the sensitivity of the modeled allowance estimate to macroeconomic forecast data, but is absent of qualitative overlays and other qualitative adjustments that are part of the quarterly reserving process and does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance for reasons including increases or decreases in qualitative adjustments, changes in the risk profile and size of the portfolio, changes in the severity of the macroeconomic scenario and the range of scenarios under management consideration.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK
Market risk represents the potential economic loss on trading and non-trading portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse price movements in markets including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, commodity prices and equity and related implied volatility levels. The Company is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on its portfolio of assets held for purposes other than trading and interest rate derivative instruments that are used for managing interest rate risk. In addition, the Company has exposure to market risk through its trading desks that engage in securities, derivatives and foreign exchange transactions to support the capital raising, investing and hedging activities of customers. The Company may manage or reduce market risk through the use of hedging, short sale or other similar transactions intended to reduce market risk to be within tolerance levels designated by the Company’s market risk management strategy. The Company uses Value-at-Risk (“VaR”) as a means to measure, monitor, and limit aggregate market risk on the trading portfolio. VaR is a statistical risk measure estimating potential loss at the 95th percentile based on a one-year history of market risk factors associated with the trading portfolio. VaR provides a consistent cross-asset measure for risk profiles and allows for diversification benefit based on historical correlations across market moves. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s exposure through its trading desk does not pose a significant market risk to the Company. All statistical models involve a degree of uncertainty and VaR is calculated at a statistical confidence interval of the 95th percentile based on one-year daily historic market moves. Larger economic losses are possible, particularly during stressed macroeconomic and market conditions.
The responsibility for managing market risk rests with the ALCO, which operates under policy guidelines established by the Company’s board of directors. Oversight of the Company’s compliance with the guidelines is the ongoing responsibility of the ALCO, with exceptions reported to the Executive Risk Committee and the board of directors, if necessary, on a quarterly basis.
Interest Rate Risk Management
The Company’s interest rate sensitivity as of December 31, 2024 is illustrated in the following table. The table reflects rate-sensitive positions as of December 31, 2024 and is not necessarily indicative of positions on other dates. The table does not take into account the effect of the Company’s derivatives designated as cash flow hedges. The balances of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are presented in the periods in which they next reprice to market rates or mature and are aggregated to show the interest rate sensitivity gap. The mismatch between repricings or maturities within a time period is commonly referred to as the “gap” for that period. A positive gap (asset sensitive), where interest rate sensitive assets exceed interest rate sensitive liabilities, generally will result in the net interest margin increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a falling rate environment. A negative gap (liability sensitive) will generally have the opposite results on the net interest margin. Certain variable rate loans have embedded floors which limit the decline in yield on those loans at times when market interest rates are extraordinarily low. The degree of asset sensitivity, spreads on loans and net interest margin may be reduced until rates increase by an amount sufficient to eliminate the effects of floors. The adverse effect of floors as market rates increase may also be offset by the positive gap, the extent to which rates on deposits and other funding sources lag increasing market rates for loans and changes in composition of funding.

While a gap interest table is useful in analyzing interest rate sensitivity, an interest rate sensitivity simulation provides a better illustration of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates. Earnings are also affected by the effects of changing interest rates on the value of funding derived from non-interest bearing deposits and stockholders’ equity. Management performs a sensitivity analysis to identify interest rate risk exposure on net interest income. Management also quantifies and measures interest rate risk exposure using a model to dynamically simulate the effect of changes in net interest income relative to changes in interest rates over the next twelve months based on different interest rate scenarios. These are a static rate scenario and “shock test” scenarios, as described below.
These scenarios are based on interest rates as of the last day of a reporting period published by independent sources and incorporate relevant spreads of instruments that are actively traded in the open market. The Federal Reserve’s federal funds target affects short-term borrowing; the prime lending rate, SOFR, Bloomberg Short Term Yield Index and other alternative indexes are the basis for most of the variable-rate loan pricing. The 10-year treasury rate is also monitored because of its effect on prepayment speeds for mortgage-backed securities. These are the Company’s primary interest rate exposures. Interest rate derivative contracts may be used to manage exposure to adverse fluctuations in these primary interest rate exposures as is discussed in more detail under the heading 
Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks 
below.
For modeling purposes, the “shock test” scenarios as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 assume immediate parallel, sustained 100 and 200 basis point increases in interest rates as well as 100 and 200 basis point decreases in interest rates. The Company will continue to evaluate these scenarios as interest rates change.
The Company’s interest rate risk exposure model incorporates assumptions regarding the level of interest rate, including indeterminable maturity deposits (non-interest bearing deposits, interest bearing transaction accounts and savings accounts) and loan and security prepayment behaviors for a given level of market rate change. In the current environment of changing short-term rates, deposit pricing can vary by product and customer. These assumptions have been developed through a combination of historical analysis and projection of future expected pricing behavior. Changes in prepayment behavior of mortgage-backed securities and residential and commercial mortgage loans in each rate environment are captured using industry estimates of prepayment speeds for various coupon segments of the portfolio.
 The impact of these changes is factored into the simulation model results and indicated interest rate sensitivity as follows:
Annualized Hypothetical Change in Net Interest Income
December 31, 2024
December 31, 2023
     + 200 basis points
6.8

     - 200 basis points
(13.7)

(9.1)
%
The simulations used to manage interest risk are based on numerous assumptions regarding the effect of changes in interest rates on the timing and extent of repricing characteristics, future cash flows and customer behavior. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions, customer behavior and management strategies, among other factors.
Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks
In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into derivative transactions to manage various risks and to accommodate the business requirements of its customers. 
On the date the Company enters into a derivative contract, the derivative is designated as either a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, net investment hedge, or a designation is not made as it is a customer-related transaction, an economic hedge for asset/liability risk management purposes or another stand-alone derivative created through the Company’s operations.
To manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate, prepayment, credit, price and foreign currency fluctuations (asset and liability management positions), the Company may enter into derivative transactions. In addition, the Company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its customers (customer-related positions).

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income
,
 stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 11, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.

Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans
Description of the Matter
The Company’s loans held for investment portfolio totaled $22.5 billion as of December 31, 2024, and the associated allowance for credit losses (ACL) was $325.0 million. The ACL represents management’s best estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual life of loans and for off-balance sheet commitments. The ACL is estimated using relevant available information relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, as well as qualitative adjustments using a Portfolio Level Qualitative Factor and/or Portfolio Segment Level Qualitative Factor (collectively the “qualitative factors”). The qualitative factors are used to bring the ACL to the level management believes is appropriate based on factors that are otherwise unaccounted for in the quantitative process. The ACL also includes reserves for loans evaluated on an individual basis, such as certain loans graded substandard or worse. Management applies judgment in the determination and usage of the qualitative factors, and in the use of a single or a blend of forecast scenarios used to calculate the reasonable and supportable forecast. 
Auditing management’s estimate of the ACL is complex due to the models utilized and involves a high degree of subjectivity due to the judgment required in evaluating management’s determination and usage of the qualitative factors, and in the use of a single or blend of forecast scenarios used to calculate the reasonable and supportable forecast.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
Our considerations and procedures performed included evaluation of the process utilized by management to challenge the model results and determine the best estimate of the ACL as of the balance sheet date. We obtained an understanding of the Company’s process for establishing the ACL, including determination and usage of the qualitative factors and determination of a single or blend of multiple forecast scenarios used to calculate the reasonable and supportable forecast. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls associated with the ACL process, including controls around 1) the reliability and accuracy of data used in the model; 2) management’s review and approval of the selected qualitative factors; 3) the single or blend of multiple forecast scenarios used to calculate the reasonable and supportable forecast; 4) the governance of the credit loss methodology including model validation; and 5) management’s review and approval of the ACL.
We performed specific substantive tests of the models utilized, qualitative factors and the single or blend of forecast scenarios used to calculate the reasonable and supportable forecast. We involved EY specialists to assist in testing management models including evaluating model methodology and key modeling assumptions, as well as the appropriateness of management’s qualitative and reasonable and supportable forecast framework. We evaluated if the qualitative factors were applied based on a comprehensive framework and compared the adjustments utilized by management to both internal portfolio metrics and external macroeconomic data (as applicable) to support the adjustments and evaluate trends in such adjustments. We searched for and evaluated information that corroborates or contradicts management’s reasonable and supportable forecast as well as identification and measurement of qualitative factors. In addition, we evaluated the Company’s estimate of the overall ACL, giving consideration to the Company’s borrowers, loan portfolio, and macroeconomic trends, independently obtained and compared such information to comparable financial institutions and considered whether new or contrary information existed.

Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Organization and Nature of Business
Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc. (“TCBI” or the “Company”) is a registered bank holding company and a full-service financial services firm that delivers customized solutions to businesses, entrepreneurs and individual customers. TCBI is headquartered in Dallas, with primary banking offices in Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio, and has built a network of clients across the country. 
The Company’s business activities are conducted primarily through its wholly-owned bank subsidiary Texas Capital Bank (the “Bank”) and its wholly-owned non-bank subsidiary, TCBI Securities Inc. (“TCBI Securities”). The Bank is a Texas state-chartered bank. TCBI Securities is a registered broker-dealer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”).
The Company was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1996 and commenced banking operations in 1998.
Basis of Presentation
The Company’s accounting and reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and to generally accepted practices within the banking industry. Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The allowance for credit losses, the fair value of financial instruments and the status of contingencies are particularly susceptible to significant change.
See the Allowance for Credit Losses accounting policy below for additional details of these changes.
Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Common Share
Basic earnings per common share is based on net income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period excluding non-vested stock-settled awards. Diluted earnings per common share include the dilutive effect of non-vested stock-settled awards granted using the treasury stock method.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents include amounts due from banks, interest bearing deposits in other banks and federal funds sold.
Investment Securities
Investment securities include debt securities and equity securities.
Debt Securities
Debt securities are classified as trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity or trading are classified as available-for-sale. Management classifies securities at the time of purchase and re-assesses such designation at each balance sheet date.
The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the estimated life of the security. Such amortization and accretion are included in interest income from investment securities. Gains or losses realized upon the sale of debt securities are recorded in other non-interest income on the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
The Company has made a policy election to exclude accrued interest from the amortized cost basis of debt securities and report accrued interest separately in accrued interest and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities are placed on non-accrual status when management no longer expects to receive all contractual amounts due, which is generally at 90 days past due. Accrued interest receivable is reversed against interest income when a security is placed on non-accrual status. Accordingly, the Company does not recognize an allowance for credit loss against accrued interest receivable.
Trading Account
Debt securities acquired for resale in anticipation of short-term market movements are classified as trading and recorded at fair value, with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in income.
56
Held-to-Maturity
Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity securities are stated at amortized cost, net of any allowance for credit losses.
Management may transfer debt securities classified as available-for-sale to held-to-maturity when upon reassessment it is determined that the Company has both the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. The debt securities are transferred at fair value resulting in a premium or discount recorded on transfer date. Unrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer continue to be reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income/loss, net (“AOCI”).  The premium or discount and the unrealized gain or loss, net of tax, in AOCI will be amortized to interest income over the remaining life of the securities using the interest method. 
Available-for-Sale
Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of AOCI. For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more-likely-than-not that it will be required to sell, the securities before recovery of the amortized cost basis. If either of these criteria is met, the securities’ amortized cost basis is written down to fair value as a current period expense recorded on the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income. If either of the above criteria is not met, management evaluates whether the decline in fair value is the result of credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management may consider various factors including the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, performance of any underlying collateral and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security and any excess is recorded as an allowance for credit losses, limited to the amount by which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment not recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in AOCI, net of tax, as a non-credit related impairment.
Included in debt securities available-for-sale are credit risk transfer (“CRT”) securities, which represent unsecured obligations issued by government sponsored entities (“GSEs”) such as Freddie Mac and are designed to transfer mortgage credit risk from the GSE to private investors. CRT securities are structured to be subject to the performance of a reference pool of mortgage loans in which the Company shares in 50% of the first losses with the GSE. If the reference pool incurs losses, the amount the Company will recover on the notes is reduced by its share of the amount of such losses, which could potentially be up to 100% of the amount outstanding. Unrealized losses recognized in AOCI for the CRT securities are primarily related to the difference between the current market rate for similar securities and the stated interest rate and are not considered to be related to credit loss events. The CRT securities are generally interest-only for an initial period of time and may be restricted from being transferred until a future date.
Equity Securities
Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are stated at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses reported in income. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost less any impairment.
Loans
Loans Held for Sale
Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, unless, pursuant to the election of the fair value option in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 825, 
Financial Instruments
, the Company elects to carry loans held for sale at fair value. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has no loans held for sale accounted for under the fair value option.
Loans Held for Investment
Loans held for investment (including financing leases) are stated at the amount of unpaid principal reduced by unearned income, net of direct loan origination costs. Interest on loans is recognized using the simple interest method on the daily balances of the principal amounts outstanding. Loan origination fees, net of direct loan origination costs, and commitment fees are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to yield over the life of the loan, or over the commitment period, as applicable.
A loan is considered past due when a contractually due payment has not been received by the contractual due date. The Company places a loan on non-accrual when there is a clear indication that the borrower’s cash flow may not be sufficient to meet payments as they become due, which is generally when a loan is 90 days past due. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, all previously accrued and unpaid interest is reversed as a reduction of current period interest income. Interest income is subsequently recognized on a cash basis as long as the remaining book balance of the asset is deemed to be collectible. If collectability is questionable, then cash payments are applied to principal. A loan is placed back on accrual status when both principal and interest are current and it is probable that all amounts due will be collected (both principal and interest) according to the terms of the loan agreement.
57
Loans held for investment includes legal ownership interests in mortgage loans that the Company purchases from unaffiliated mortgage originators, either directly or through a special purpose entity (“SPE”) structure, who are seeking additional liquidity to facilitate their ability to originate loans.  In the case of an SPE structure, the unaffiliated mortgage originator is responsible for formation of the SPE and ongoing servicing of the underlying mortgage loans, and thus is the primary beneficiary of the SPE. The mortgage originator has no obligation to offer and the Company has no obligation to purchase these interests. The originator closes mortgage loans consistent with underwriting standards established by approved investors, and, at the time of the sale to the investor, the Company’s ownership interest and that of the originator are delivered to the investor selected by the originator. The Company typically purchases up to a 99% ownership interest in each mortgage with the originator owning the remaining percentage. These mortgage ownership interests are generally held for a period of less than 30 days and more typically 10-20 days. Because of conditions in agreements with originators (or SPEs) designed to reduce transaction risks, under ASC 860, 
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
 (“ASC 860”), the ownership interests do not qualify as participating interests. Under ASC 860, the ownership interests are deemed to be loans to the originators (or SPEs) and payments received from investors are deemed to be payments made by or on behalf of the originators (or SPEs) to repay the loan. Because the Company has an actual, legal ownership interest in the underlying residential mortgage loan, these interests are reported as extensions of credit to the originators (or SPEs) that are secured by the mortgage loans as collateral. Due to market conditions or events of default by the investor or the originators (or SPEs), the Company could be required to purchase the remaining interests in the mortgage loans and hold them beyond the expected 10-20 days. Mortgage loans acquired under these conditions would require mark-to-market adjustments to income and could require further allocations of the allowance for credit losses or be subject to charge-off in the event the loans become impaired.
Purchased loans are evaluated upon acquisition in order to determine if the loan, or pool of loans, has experienced more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination or issuance (“PCD loans”). PCD loans are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date along with an allowance for credit losses determined using the same methodology as originated loans. The sum of the loan’s purchase price and allowance for credit losses becomes its initial amortized cost basis. The difference between the initial amortized cost basis and the par value of the loan is a non-credit discount or premium, which is amortized into interest income over the life of the loan. Subsequent changes to the allowance for credit losses are recorded through provision for credit losses.
Allowance for Credit Losses
The Company’s allowance for credit losses is determined using a current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model. The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and held-to-maturity debt securities. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor in accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 
"Leases (Topic 842)"
.
The following is a discussion of the allowance for credit losses on loans held for investment and off-balance sheet credit exposures.  See “
Investment Securities - Debt Securities
” above for discussion of the allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale and held-to maturity debt securities.
The CECL methodology recognizes lifetime expected credit losses immediately when a financial asset is originated or purchased. The allowance for credit losses on loans is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loans, or portions thereof, are charged off against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off. The allowance for credit losses on off-balance sheet financial instruments is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, credit quality, or term, as well as for changes in macroeconomic conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, gross domestic product, property values, or other relevant factors. 
The allowance for credit losses is comprised of reserves measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are assigned a reserve based on an individual evaluation and are not included in the collective (pool) evaluation. For purposes of determining the collective (pool) allowance for credit losses, the loan portfolio is segregated into pools first by portfolio segment and then by past due status or credit grade. Each pool is assigned a loss estimate, reflecting historical loss rates that incorporate probability of default and severity of losses over the estimated remaining life of the loans. These loss estimates are then modified to incorporate a reasonable and supportable forecast of future losses at the pool level, as well as any necessary qualitative adjustments using a Portfolio Level Qualitative Factor (“PLQF”) 
58
and/or a Portfolio Segment Level Qualitative Factor (“SLQF”). A similar process is employed to calculate a reserve assigned to off-balance financial instruments, specifically unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. Modified loss estimates are assigned based on the balance of the commitments estimated to be outstanding at the time of default. The PLQF and SLQF are utilized to address factors that are not present in historical loss rates and are otherwise unaccounted for in the quantitative process. The PLQF is used to apply a qualitative adjustment across the entire portfolio of loans, while the SLQF is designed to apply a qualitative adjustment across a single portfolio segment. Even though portions of the allowance may be allocated to specific loans, the entire allowance is available for any credit that, in management’s judgment, should be charged off. 
The Company generally uses a two-year forecast period, based on a single forecast scenario or a blend of multiple forecast scenarios, using variables management believes are most relevant to each portfolio segment. For periods beyond which management is able to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts, the Company reverts to the average historical loss rate, reflecting historical default probabilities and loss severities, using a reversion speed that approximates 1 to 2 years. The forecast period and scenario(s) used are reviewed on a quarterly basis and may be adjusted based on management's view of the current economic conditions and level of predictability the forecast can provide.
Portfolio segments are used to pool loans with similar risk characteristics and align with the Company’s methodology for measuring expected credit losses. A summary of the primary portfolio segments is as follows:
Commercial. 
The commercial loan portfolio is comprised of lines of credit for working capital, term loans, reserve-based loans to energy exploration and production companies, and leases to finance equipment and other business assets across a variety of industries. These loans are used for general corporate purposes including financing working capital, internal growth, and acquisitions and are generally secured by accounts receivable, inventory, oil and gas reserves, equipment and other assets of clients’ businesses.
Mortgage Finance. 
Mortgage finance loans include legal ownership interests in mortgage loans that the Company purchases from unaffiliated mortgage originators, either directly or through a SPE structure, that are generally held for a period of less than 30 days and more typically 10-20 days before they are sold to an approved investor. Volumes fluctuate based on the level of market demand for the product and the number of days between purchase and sale of the loans, which can be affected by changes in overall market interest rates and housing demand and tend to peak at the end of each month. Mortgage finance loans are consistently underwritten based on standards established by the approved investors.  Market conditions or events of default by an investor or originator could require that the Company repurchases the remaining interests in the mortgage loans and hold them beyond the expected 10-20 days.
Commercial Real Estate (“CRE”). 
The CRE portfolio is comprised of construction/development financing and limited term financing provided to professional real estate developers, owners/managers of commercial real estate projects and properties, and residential builders/developers. Collateral properties include office buildings, warehouse/distribution buildings, shopping centers, hotels/motels, senior living, apartment buildings, residential and commercial tract developments, and raw land or lots to be developed into single-family homes. The primary source of repayment on these loans is expected to come from the sale, permanent financing or lease of the real property collateral. The performance of these loans is impacted by fluctuations in collateral values, the ability of the borrower to obtain permanent financing, and, in the case of loans to residential builder/developers, volatility in consumer demand.
Consumer.
 This category of loans is comprised of loans made to consumers for personal expenditures, first and second lien mortgages made for the purpose of purchasing or constructing 1-4 family residential dwellings and home equity revolving lines of credit.
The Company has several pass credit grades that are assigned to loans based on varying levels of risk, ranging from credits that are secured by cash or marketable securities, to watch credits which have all the characteristics of an acceptable credit risk but warrant more than the normal level of monitoring. Within the criticized/classified credit grades are special mention, substandard and doubtful. Special mention loans are those that are currently protected by the sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower, but that are potentially weak and constitute an additional credit risk. These loans have the potential to deteriorate to a substandard grade due to the existence of financial or administrative deficiencies. Substandard loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardizes the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Some substandard loans are inadequately protected by the sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower and of the collateral pledged and may be considered impaired. Substandard loans can be accruing or can be on non-accrual depending on the circumstances of the individual loans. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in substandard loans with the added characteristics that the weaknesses make collection in full highly questionable and improbable. The possibility of loss is extremely high. All doubtful loans are on non-accrual.
The methodology used in the estimation of the allowance, which is performed at least quarterly, is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in portfolio credit quality and forecasted economic conditions. Changes are reflected in the pool-basis allowance and in reserves assigned on an individual basis as the collectability of classified loans is evaluated with new 
59
information. As the Company’s portfolio has matured, historical loss ratios have been closely monitored. The review of the appropriateness of the allowance is performed by executive management and presented to the Audit Committee and Risk Committee of the board of directors for their review. The committees report to the board of directors as part of the board of directors’ quarterly review of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
When management determines that foreclosure is probable, and for certain collateral-dependent loans where foreclosure is not considered probable, expected credit losses are based on the estimated fair value of the collateral adjusted for selling costs, when appropriate. A loan is considered collateral-dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral.
Expected credit losses are estimated over the contractual term of the loans, adjusted for expected prepayments when appropriate. The contractual term excludes expected extensions, renewals and modifications unless either of the following applies: management has a reasonable expectation that a loan will be restructured or the extension or renewal options are included in the borrower contract and are not unconditionally cancellable.
The Company does not measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable balances because these balances are written off in a timely manner as a reduction to interest income when loans are placed on non-accrual status as discussed above.
Other Real Estate Owned
Other real estate owned (“OREO”), which is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, consists of real estate that has been foreclosed. When foreclosure occurs, the acquired asset is recorded at fair value less selling costs, generally based on appraised value, which may result in partial charge-off of the loan through a charge to the allowance for credit losses, if necessary. Subsequent write-downs required for declines in value are recorded through a valuation allowance, or taken directly to the asset, and are recorded in other non-interest expense on the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income. Gains or losses on sale of OREO are recorded in other non-interest income on the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net
Intangible assets are acquired assets that lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. The Company had $
1.5
 million of goodwill at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated life. 
No
 amortization expense related to intangible assets was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023, as compared to $
338,000
 during the years ended December 31, 2022. Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are recorded at fair value. In 2024 and 2023, the annual test of goodwill impairment was performed, and in both periods, no impairment was indicated.
Premises and Equipment, Net
Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Furniture and equipment are generally depreciated over 
three
 to 
five years
, while leasehold improvements are generally depreciated over the term of their respective lease. Gains or losses on disposals of premises and equipment are included in other non-interest income on the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income.
Software
Costs incurred in connection with development or purchase of internal use software and cloud computing arrangements, including in-substance software licenses, are capitalized. Amortization is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, which generally ranges from 
one
 to 
five years
. Capitalized software is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
The Company has undertaken certain guarantee obligations in the ordinary course of business which include liabilities with off-balance sheet risk.
The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit that involve varying degrees of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to these financial instruments is 
60
represented by the contractual amount of the instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the borrower.
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer’s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. Commitments to extend credit generally do not include mortgage finance loan arrangements with mortgage loan originators (or SPEs), which are established as uncommitted “guidance” purchase and sale facilities under which the mortgage originator has no obligation to offer and the Company has no obligation to purchase interests in the mortgage loans subject to the arrangements.
Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers.
Leases
Right of use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease agreements may contain extension options which typically provide for an extension of a lease term at the then fair market rental rates. As these extension options are not generally considered reasonably certain of exercise, they are not included in the lease term. Operating leases relate primarily to real estate used for corporate offices and bank branches and finance leases relate primarily to equipment. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components for real estate leases.
For those leases with a term greater than one year, ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at lease commencement based on the present value of the remaining lease payments using a discount rate that represents the incremental borrowing rate on the effective date of the lease, which is based on the Company’s collateralized borrowing capabilities over a similar term as the related lease payments. ROU assets are further adjusted for lease incentives.
Operating leases in which the Company is the lessee are recorded as operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities, and are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease expense, which is comprised of amortization of the ROU asset and the implicit interest accreted on the operating lease liability, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in net occupancy expense on the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income.
Finance leases in which the Company is the lessee are recorded as finance lease ROU assets and finance lease liabilities and are included in premises and equipment, net, and other liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease expense is comprised of amortization of the ROU asset, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in net occupancy expense on the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income, and the implicit interest accreted on the operating lease liability, which is recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term and recorded in interest expense on the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income.
Variable costs, such as maintenance expenses, parking and property and sales taxes, are expensed as they are incurred, and are recorded in net occupancy expense on the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income.
Revenue Recognition
ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (“ASC 606”), establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from the entity's contracts to provide goods or services to customers. The core principle requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that it expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services recognized as performance obligations are satisfied.
The majority of the Company’s revenue-generating transactions are not subject to ASC 606, including revenue generated from financial instruments, such as loans, letters of credit, derivatives and investment securities, as these activities are subject to other GAAP discussed elsewhere within the Company’s disclosures. Descriptions of revenue-generating activities that are within the scope of ASC 606, which are presented in the income statements as components of non-interest income are as follows:
•
Service charges on deposit accounts - these represent general service fees for monthly account maintenance and activity- or transaction-based fees and consist of transaction-based revenue, time-based revenue (service period), item-based revenue or some other individual attribute-based revenue. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is completed, which is generally monthly for account maintenance services or when a transaction has been 
61
completed (such as a stop payment). Payments for these activities are generally received at the time the performance obligations are satisfied.
•
Wealth management and trust fee income - this represents monthly fees due from wealth management customers as consideration for managing the customers’ assets. Wealth management and trust services include custody of assets, investment management, escrow services, fees for trust services and similar fiduciary activities. These fees are typically paid on a quarterly basis and recognized ratably throughout the quarter as the performance obligation is satisfied each month.
•
Brokered loan fees - these represent fees for the administration and funding of purchased mortgage loan interests as well as facility renewal and application fees received from mortgage originators (or SPEs) related to mortgage finance loans. Revenue is recognized when the related mortgage loan interest is disposed (i.e., through sale or payoff) or upon receipt of the facility renewal or application. 
•
Investment banking and advisory fees - this includes fees for merger, acquisition, divestiture and restructuring advisory services, fees for securities underwriting activities and loan and security syndication fees. Advisory fees are generally earned as performance obligations of the advisory service are satisfied. Underwriting fees are generally recognized upon execution of the client’s issuance of debt or equity instruments. Loan syndication fees are generally recognized upon closing of a loan syndication transaction.
•
Trading income - this includes fees for derivative transactions which are generally recognized when the derivative transaction occurs. Also included in trading income are realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized on the Company’s trading assets and liabilities. Realized gains and losses are generally recognized when a sale occurs and unrealized gains and losses are generally recognized monthly as the trading assets and liabilities are marked to fair value.
•
Other non-interest income includes items such as letter of credit fees, bank owned life insurance income, dividends on FHLB and FRB stock and other general operating income, none of which are subject to the requirements of ASC 606. Also included in other-non-interest income are interchange fees earned when commercial credit card clients process transactions through card networks. The Company’s performance obligations are generally complete when the transactions generating the fees are processed.
Stock-based Compensation
The Company accounts for all stock-based compensation transactions in accordance with ASC 718, 
Compensation — Stock Compensation
 (“ASC 718”), which requires that stock compensation transactions be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period, with forfeitures recognized as they occur, on the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income based on their fair values on the measurement date, which is generally the date of the grant. As compensation expense is recognized, a deferred tax asset is recorded that represents an estimate of the future tax deduction from exercise or release of restrictions. At the time awards are exercised, cancelled, expire or restrictions are released, the Company recognizes an adjustment to income tax expense for the difference between the previously estimated tax deduction and the actual tax deduction realized.
Income Taxes
The Company and its subsidiary file a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company utilizes the liability method in accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the values of the assets and liabilities as reflected in the financial statements and their related tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. As changes in tax law or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. A valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax assets, net, are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
The tax effect of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities and derivative instruments designated as hedges is recorded to other comprehensive income and is not a component of income tax expense/(benefit).
Unrecognized tax benefits for the uncertain portion of recorded tax benefits and related interest may result from the application of complex tax laws, rules, regulations and interpretations. Unrecognized tax benefits, as well as estimated penalties and interest, are assessed quarterly and may be adjusted through current income tax expense in future periods based on changing facts and circumstances, completion of examinations by taxing authorities or expiration of a statute of limitations.
62
Fair Values of Financial Instruments
ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures
 (“ASC 820”), defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value as provided below.
Level 1    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3    Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair values requires significant management judgment or estimation.
Also required are disclosures of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practical to estimate that value. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. The disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments does not and is not intended to represent the fair value of the Company.
The following are descriptions of the methods and significant assumptions used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:
Cash and Cash Equivalents, Variable Rate Loans, Variable Rate Short-term Borrowings and Variable Rate Long-term Debt 
The fair value of these financial instruments approximates carrying value. 
Investment Securities
The fair value of the Company’s U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agency, residential mortgage-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities are based on prices obtained from independent pricing services.  The Company’s U.S. Treasury securities are valued based on quoted market prices for identical securities in an active market and are classified as Level 1 assets in the fair value hierarchy, while the Company’s U.S. government agency, residential mortgage-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities are valued based on quoted market prices for the same or similar securities and are characterized as Level 2 assets in the fair value hierarchy. Management obtains documentation from the primary independent pricing service regarding the processes and controls applicable to pricing investment securities, and on a quarterly basis independently verify the prices that were received from the service provider using two additional independent pricing sources. CRT securities are valued using a discounted cash flow model, which utilizes Level 3 inputs, and are classified as Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
Within the investment securities portfolio, the Company holds equity securities that consist of investments that qualify for consideration under the regulations implementing the Community Reinvestment Act and investments in exchange traded funds. Some of these equity securities are valued using quoted market prices for identical equity securities in an active market and are classified as Level 1 assets in the fair value hierarchy and others are traded in less active markets and are classified as Level 2 assets in the fair value hierarchy. 
Loans Held for Sale
The fair value for loans held for sale is derived from quoted market prices for similar loans, in which case they are characterized as Level 2 assets in the fair value hierarchy, or is derived from third party pricing models, in which case they are characterized as Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy.
Securities Sold Not Yet Purchased
The fair value for securities sold but not yet purchased is derived from quoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1 liabilities in the fair value hierarchy.
Derivative Assets and Liabilities
The estimated fair value of derivative assets and liabilities is obtained from independent pricing services based on quoted market prices for similar derivative contracts and these financial instruments are characterized as Level 2 assets and liabilities in the fair value hierarchy. On a quarterly basis, management independently verifies the fair value using an additional independent pricing source.
63
Derivative Financial Instruments
All contracts that satisfy the definition of a derivative are recorded at fair value in other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, and the related cash flows are recorded in the operating activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows. The Company records the derivatives on a net basis when a right of offset exists with a single counterparty that is subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement.
Non-Hedging Derivatives
The Company enters into interest rate derivative instruments with customers while at the same time entering into offsetting interest rate derivative instruments with another financial institution. These transactions allow the customer to effectively manage their exposure to a variable rate loan. Because the Company acts as an intermediary for its customers, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative instruments substantially offset each other and do not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations.
The Company offers forward contract derivative instruments, such as to-be-announced U.S. agency residential mortgage-back securities, to its mortgage banking customers to allow the customers to mitigate exposure to market risks associated with the purchase or origination of mortgage loans. To mitigate the Company’s exposure to these forward contracts, the Company will enter into offsetting forward contracts, most typically with a financial institution. Any changes in fair value to the forward contract derivative instruments are recorded in trading income on the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income.
The Company also offers foreign currency derivative instruments in which the Company enters into a contract with a customer to buy or sell a foreign currency at a future date for a specified price while at the same time entering into an offsetting contract with a financial institution to buy or sell the same currency at the same future date for a specified price. The transaction allows the customer to manage their exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Because the Company acts as an intermediary for its customers, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative instruments substantially offset each other and do not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations.
Derivatives Designated as Hedges
The Company enters into interest rate derivative contracts that are designated as qualifying cash flow hedges to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows attributable to changes in a contractually specified interest rate. To qualify for hedge accounting, a formal assessment is prepared to determine whether the hedging relationship, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge if a cash flow hedge. At inception a statistical regression analysis is prepared to determine hedge effectiveness. At each reporting period thereafter, a statistical regression or qualitative analysis is performed. If it is determined that hedge effectiveness has not been or will not continue to be highly effective, then hedge accounting ceases and any gain or loss in AOCI is recognized in earnings immediately. The cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value in other assets and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded in AOCI, net of tax. All related cash flows are reported in the operating activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows. Amounts recorded to AOCI are reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged asset or liability affects earnings and are presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged asset or liability.

Segment Reporting
The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2023-07 “
Segment Reporting (Topic 280) - Improvement to Reportable Segment Disclosures”
 on January 1, 2024. The Company has determined that all of its banking divisions and subsidiaries meet the aggregation criteria of ASC 280, 
Segment Reporting
, as its current operating model is structured whereby banking divisions and subsidiaries serve a similar base of primarily commercial clients utilizing a company-wide offering of similar products and services managed through similar processes and platforms that are collectively reviewed by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, who has been identified as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”).
The CODM regularly assesses performance of the aggregated single operating and reporting segment and decides how to allocate resources based on net income calculated on the same basis as is net income reported in the Company’s consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income. The CODM is also regularly provided with expense information at a level consistent with that disclosed in the Company’s consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income.

At December 31, 2024, the Company had 
60
 available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, comprised of 
6
 U.S. Treasury securities, 
46
 residential mortgage-backed securities, 6 commercial mortgage-backed securities and 
two
 CRT securities. The unrealized losses on the available-for-sale debt securities were the result of changes in market interest rates compared to the date the securities were acquired rather than the credit quality of the issuers or underlying loans. The Company does not currently intend to sell and based on current conditions it does not believe it is likely that the Company will be required to sell these available-for-sale debt securities before recovery of the amortized cost of such securities in an unrealized loss position and has therefore recorded the unrealized losses related to this portfolio in AOCI. Held-to-maturity securities consist of government guaranteed securities for which 
no
 loss is expected. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 
no
 allowance for credit losses was established for available-for-sale or held-to-maturity debt securities.
66
At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, debt securities with carrying values of approximately $
940,000
 and $
1.6
 million, respectively, were pledged to secure certain customer deposits.

Regulatory Ratios and Capital
The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory (and possibly additional discretionary) actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on the Company’s and the Bank’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company’s and the Bank’s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company’s and the Bank’s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
The Basel III Capital Rules adopted by U.S. federal banking agencies, among other things, (i) establish the capital measure called “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”), (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 Capital” instruments meeting stated requirements, (iii) require that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to other components of capital and (iv) define the scope of the deductions/adjustments to the capital measures.
Additionally, the Basel III Capital Rules require that the Company maintain a 
2.5
% capital conservation buffer comprised of CET1, with respect to each of CET1, Tier 1 and total capital to risk-weighted asset ratios. A financial institution with a conservation buffer of less than the required amount is subject to limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. No dividends were declared or paid on the Company’s common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024 or during 2023. On January 17, 2024, the Company’s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under which the Company could repurchase up to $
150.0
 million in shares of its outstanding common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 
1,381,436
 shares of its common stock for an aggregate price, including excise tax expense, of $
81.5
 million, at a weighted average price of $
58.57
 per share. On January 22, 2025, the Company’s board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to $200.0 million in shares of its outstanding common stock, excluding the effect of excise tax expense incurred on net stock repurchases. The share repurchase program expires on January 31, 2026, but may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Remaining repurchase authorization under the January 17, 2024 share repurchase program was terminated upon authorization of this new program.
In February 2019, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule (the “2019 CECL Rule”) that revised certain capital regulations to account for changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP. The 2019 CECL Rule included a transition option that allows banking organizations to phase in, over a three-year period, the day-one adverse effects of adopting the new accounting standard related to the measurement of current expected credit losses on their regulatory capital ratios (three-year transition option). In March 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that maintains the three-year transition option of the 2019 CECL Rule and also provides banking organizations that were required under GAAP to implement CECL before the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years an estimate of the effect of CECL on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). The Company adopted CECL on January 1, 2020 and has elected to utilize the five-year transition option. The ratios presented below include the effects of the election to utilize the five-year CECL transition described above.
74
Because the Bank had less than $
15.0
 billion in total consolidated assets as of December 31, 2009, it is allowed to continue to classify the trust preferred securities, all of which were issued prior to May 19, 2010, as Tier 1 capital.
At the beginning of each of the last five years of the life of the Bank-issued fixed rate subordinated notes due 2026, the amount that is eligible to be included in Tier 2 capital is reduced by 20% of the original amount of the notes (net of redemptions). In 2024, the amount of the notes that qualify as Tier 2 capital has been reduced by 80%.
The table below summarizes the Company’s and the Bank’s actual and required capital ratios under the Basel III Capital Rules and other standards. As shown in the table below, the Company’s and Bank’s capital ratios exceeded the regulatory definition of well capitalized as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has a qualified retirement plan with a salary deferral feature designed to qualify under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code (“the 401(k) Plan”). The 401(k) Plan permits employees to defer a portion of their compensation. Matching contributions may be made in amounts and at times determined by the Company. These contributions were approximately $
13.8
 million, $
15.2
 million and $
13.3
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Employees are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan when they meet certain requirements concerning minimum age and period of credited service. All contributions to the 401(k) Plan are invested in accordance with participant elections among certain investment options.
The Company also offers a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for executives and key members of management in order to assist in attracting and retaining these individuals. Participants in the plan may elect to defer up to 
75
% of their annual salary and/or short-term incentive payout into deferral accounts that mirror the gains or losses of investments selected by the participants. The plan allows the Company to make discretionary contributions on behalf of a participant as well as matching contributions. The Company did 
not
 make any matching contributions in 2024, 2023, or 2022. All participant contributions to the plan and any related earnings are immediately vested and may be withdrawn upon the participant's separation from service, death or disability or upon a date specified by the participant. Salary deferrals are recorded as salaries and employee benefits expense on the consolidated statements of income with an offsetting payable to participants in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
The Company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). Employees are eligible for the ESPP when they meet certain requirements concerning period of credited service and minimum hours worked. Eligible employees may contribute between 
1
% and 
10
% of eligible compensation up to the Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code limit of $25,000. In 2006, stockholders approved the ESPP, which allocated 
400,000
 shares for purchase. As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, 
231,505
, 
210,558
 and 
184,263
 shares, respectively, had been purchased on behalf of employees under the ESPP.
The Company has stock-based compensation plans under which equity-based compensation grants are made by the board of directors, or its designated committee. Grants are subject to vesting requirements and may be settled in shares of common stock or paid in cash. Under the plans, the Company may grant, among other things, non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), performance awards or any combination thereof to employees and non-employee directors. The Company has historically issued new shares to satisfy share unit conversions. A total of 
1,400,000
 shares are authorized for grant under the current plan. Total shares remaining available for grant under the current plan at December 31, 2024 were 
249,423
.

A summary of the Company’s SAR activity and related information is as follows. Grants of SARs include time-based vesting conditions that generally vest ratably over a period of

CRT securities
The fair value of CRT securities is based on a discounted cash flow model, which utilizes Level 3 inputs, the most significant of which were a discount rate and weighted-average life. At December 31, 2024, the discount rates utilized ranged from 
5.02
% to 
6.58
% and the weighted-average life ranged from 
4.51
 years to 
6.66
 years. On a combined amortized cost weighted-average basis a discount rate of 
5.63
% and a weighted-average life of 
5.35
 years were utilized to determine the fair value of these securities at December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2023, the combined weighted-average discount rate and weighted-average life utilized were 
6.57
% and 
6.06
 years, respectively.
Loans held for investment
Certain collateral-dependent loans held for investment are reported at fair value when, based upon an individual evaluation, the specific allocation of the allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the loan's amortized cost is based upon the fair value of the loan's underlying collateral. The $
35.3
 million fair value of loans held for investment at December 31, 2024 reported above includes impaired loans with a carrying value of $
63.6
 million that were reduced by specific allowance allocations totaling $
28.3
 million based on collateral valuations utilizing Level 3 inputs. The $
38.3
 million fair value of loans held for investment at December 31, 2023 reported above includes impaired loans with a carrying value of $
58.3
 million that were reduced by specific allowance allocations totaling $
20.0

The Company’s credit exposure on derivative instruments is limited to the net favorable value and interest payments by each counterparty. In some cases, collateral may be required from the counterparties involved if the net value of the derivative instruments exceeds a nominal amount. The Company’s credit exposure associated with these instruments, net of any collateral pledged, was approximately $
23.2
 million at December 31, 2024 and approximately $
32.9
 million at December 31, 2023. Collateral levels are monitored and adjusted on a regular basis for changes in the value of derivative instruments. At December 31, 2024, the Company had $
71.3
 million in cash collateral pledged to counterparties included in interest bearing cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheet and $
31.0
 million in cash collateral received from counterparties included in interest bearing deposits on the consolidated balance sheet. The comparative amounts at December 31, 2023, were $
119.0
 million in cash collateral pledged to counterparties and $
42.3
 million cash collateral received from counterparties.
The Company also enters into credit risk participation agreements with financial institution counterparties for interest rate swaps related to loans in which the Company is either a participant or a lead bank. The risk participation agreements entered into by the Company as a participant bank provide credit protection to the financial institution counterparty should the borrower fail to perform on its interest rate derivative contract with that financial institution. The Company is party to 
17
 risk participation agreements where it acts as a participant bank with a notional amount of $
228.6
 million at December 31, 2024, compared to 
14
 risk participation agreements with a notional amount of $
230.7
 million at December 31, 2023. The maximum estimated exposure to these agreements, assuming 100% default by all obligors, was approximately $
4.1
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
4.5
 million at December 31, 2023. The fair value of these exposures was insignificant to the consolidated financial statements at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Risk participation agreements entered into by the Company as the lead bank provide credit protection should the borrower fail to perform on its interest rate derivative contract. The Company is party to 
25
 risk participation agreements where the Company acts as the lead bank having a notional amount of $
349.5
 million at December 31, 2024, compared to 
15
 agreements having a notional amount of $
204.8
 million at December 31, 2023.
Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges
The Company enters into interest rate derivative contracts that are designated as qualifying cash flow hedges to hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows attributable to changes in a contractually specified interest rate. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded $
28.7
 million in unrealized losses to adjust its cash flow hedges to fair value, which was recorded net of tax to AOCI, and reclassified $
66.9
 million from AOCI as a decrease to interest income on loans. Based on current market conditions, the Company estimates that during the next 12 months, an additional $
22.5
 million related to active and terminated hedges will be reclassified from AOCI as a decrease to interest income. As of December 31, 2024, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is 
1.17
 years.

New Accounting Standards

Accounting Standards Update 2023-09 “Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”
 (“ASU 2023-09”) enhances the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023-09 will require disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. Entities will also be required to disclose income/(loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense/(benefit) disaggregated between domestic and foreign, as well as income tax expense/(benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal, state and foreign. ASU 2023-09 is effective January 1, 2025 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statement disclosures.

83
Accounting Standards Update 2024-01 “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) - Scope Application of Profits Interest and Similar Awards” 
(“ASU 2024-01”) clarifies how an entity determines whether a profits interest or similar award is within the scope of Topic 718 or is not a share-based payment arrangement and therefore within the scope of other guidance. ASU 2024-01 provides an illustrative example with multiple fact patterns and also amends certain language in the “Scope” and “Scope Exceptions” sections of Topic 718 to improve its clarity and operability without changing the guidance. Entities can apply the amendments either retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements or prospectively to profits interest and similar awards granted or modified on or after the date of adoption. If prospective application is elected, an entity must disclose the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle. ASU 2024-01 is effective January 1, 2025, including interim periods, and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.
Accounting Standards Update 2024-02 “Codification Improvements”
 (“ASU 2024-02”) amends the Codification to remove references to various concepts statements and impacts a variety of topics in the Codification. The amendments apply to all reporting entities within the scope of the affected accounting guidance, but in most instances the references removed are extraneous and not required to understand or apply the guidance. Generally, the amendments in ASU 2024-02 are not intended to result in significant accounting changes for most entities. ASU 2024-02 is effective January 1, 2025 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.
Accounting Standards Update 2024-03 “Income Statement Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses”
 (“ASU 2024-03”) improves financial reporting by requiring that public business entities disclose additional information about specific expense categories (certain costs and expenses) in the notes to the financial statements. ASU 2024-03 is effective January 1, 2026 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.
Accounting Standards Update 2024-04 “Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20)”
 (“ASU 2024-04”) clarifies wither the settlement of convertible debt, including debt containing cash conversion features at terms that are different from the terms included in the existing debt instrument, should be accounted for as an induced conversion or a debt extinguishment. ASU 2024-04 is effective for public business entities January 1, 2025 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements.

ITEM 9A.    
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Management, with the supervision and participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, disclosure controls and procedures were effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act and were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
As of December 31, 2024, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in “Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013),” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. Based on 
84
the assessment, management determined that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.
Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, is included in this Item under the heading “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.”
85
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc. 
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Texas Capital Bancshares, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 11, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
