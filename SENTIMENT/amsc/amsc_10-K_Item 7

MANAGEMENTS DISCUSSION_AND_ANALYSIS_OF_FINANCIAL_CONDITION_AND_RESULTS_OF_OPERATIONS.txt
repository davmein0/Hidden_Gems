MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Executive Overview

We are a leading system provider of megawatt-scale power resiliency solutions that orchestrate the rhythm and harmony of power on the grid™, and protect and expand the capability of our Navy's fleet. Our solutions enhance the performance of the power grid, protect our Navy’s fleet, and lower the cost of wind power.  In the power grid market, we enable electric utilities, industrial facilities, and renewable energy project developers to connect, transmit and distribute smarter, cleaner and better power through our transmission planning services and power electronics and superconductor-based systems. In the wind power market, we enable manufacturers to field highly competitive wind turbines through our advanced power electronics and control system products, engineering, and support services. Our power grid and wind products and services provide exceptional reliability, security, efficiency and affordability to our customers.

Our power system solutions help to improve energy efficiency, alleviate power grid capacity constraints, improve system resiliency, and increase the adoption of renewable energy generation. Demand for our solutions is driven by the growing needs for modernized smart grids that improve power reliability, security and quality, the U.S. Navy's effort to upgrade onboard power systems to support fleet electrification, and the needs for increased renewable sources of electricity, such as wind and solar energy. Concerns about these factors have led to increased spending by corporations and the military, as well as supportive government regulations and initiatives on local, state, and national levels, including renewable portfolio standards, tax incentives and international treaties.  

We manufacture products using two proprietary core technologies: PowerModule™ programmable power electronic converters and our Amperium® high temperature superconductor ("HTS") wires. These technologies and our system-level solutions are protected by a robust intellectual property portfolio consisting of patents and patent applications worldwide and rights through exclusive and non-exclusive licenses.

We operate our business under two market-facing business segments: Grid and Wind. We believe this market-centric structure enables us to more effectively anticipate and meet the needs of power generation project developers, the Navy's ship protection systems, electric utilities and wind turbine manufacturers.

•

Grid. 
Through our Gridtec™ Solutions, our Grid business segment enables electric utilities, industrial facilities, and renewable energy project developers to connect, transmit and distribute power with exceptional efficiency, reliability, security and affordability. We provide transmission planning services that allow us to identify power grid congestion, poor power quality, and other risks, which help us determine how our solutions can improve network performance. These services often lead to sales of our grid interconnection solutions for wind farms and solar power plants, power quality systems and transmission and distribution cable systems.  We also sell ship protection products to the U.S. Navy through our Grid business segment.

•

Wind. 
Through our Windtec™ Solutions, our Wind business segment enables manufacturers to field wind turbines with exceptional power output, reliability and affordability. We supply advanced power electronics and control systems, license our highly engineered wind turbine designs, and provide extensive customer support services to wind turbine manufacturers. Our design portfolio includes a broad range of drivetrains and power ratings of 2 megawatts ("MWs") and higher. We provide a broad range of power electronics and software-based control systems that are highly integrated and designed for optimized performance, efficiency, and grid compatibility.

Our fiscal year begins on April 1 and ends on March 31. When we refer to a particular fiscal year, we are referring to the fiscal year that began on April 1 of that same year. For example, fiscal 2024 refers to the fiscal year that began on April 1, 2024. Other fiscal years follow similarly.

Changes in macroeconomic conditions arising from various reasons, such as the ongoing wars between Russia and Ukraine, and Israel and Hamas, tariffs, trade restrictions and resulting trade conflicts, labor force availability, sourcing, material delays and global supply chain disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.

      38

On August 1, 2024, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with the selling stockholders named therein. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement and concurrently with entering into such agreement, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Megatran, Industries, Inc. ("Megatran"), for aggregate consideration in an amount equal to $61.4 million, as may be adjusted pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Price”), including a cash payment after closing of $5.0 million, as adjusted pursuant to Sections 5.6(c), (d), and (f) of the Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Additional Cash Purchase Price”). At closing, we paid to Megatran's selling stockholders $25.0 million in cash on hand, and 1,297,600 restricted shares of our common stock. On September 23, 2024, we paid the Additional Cash Purchase Price to the selling stockholders, which was calculated based on the agreed upon formula set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement, in the amount of $8.3 million which includes the Additional Cash Purchase Price and the make whole payment. Megatran's wholly-owned subsidiary, NWL, Inc. ("NWL"), is a U.S.-based global provider of engineered power conversion solutions for demanding industrial and military applications.  As a result of this transaction, Megatran became a wholly-owned subsidiary and is operated by our Grid business segment. We refer to this transaction as the "acquisition of NWL". 

Results of Operations

Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024

Revenues

Total revenues increased by 53% to $222.8 million in fiscal 2024 from $145.6 million in fiscal 2023. Our revenues are summarized as follows (in thousands):

Revenues in our Grid business segment are derived from our D-VAR product sales, Northeast Power Systems, Inc. ("NEPSI") product sales, Neeltran, Inc. ("Neeltran") product sales, NWL product sales, HTS wire sales, ship protection systems ("SPS"), government-sponsored electric utility projects and other prototype development contracts. We also engineer, install and commission our products on a turnkey-basis for some customers. The Grid business segment accounted for 84% of total revenues in both fiscal 2024 and 2023. Grid revenues increased 53% to $187.2 million in fiscal 2024 from $122.1 million in fiscal 2023. The increase in revenues was driven by higher D-VAR and NEPSI revenues than in the prior year period along with the NWL revenues earned after the acquisition of NWL.

Revenues in our Wind business segment are derived from wind turbine electrical control systems and core components, wind turbine license and development contracts, service contracts and consulting arrangements. Our Wind business segment accounted for 16% of total revenues in both fiscal 2024 and 2023. Revenues in the Wind business segment increased 51% to $35.6 million in fiscal 2024 from $23.6 million in fiscal 2023. The increase over the prior year period was driven by additional shipments of electrical control systems ("ECS") at increased prices. 

      39

Cost of Revenues and Gross Margin

Cost of revenues increased by
 46% to $161.0 million in fiscal 
2024
, compared to $110.4 million in fiscal 2023. Gross margin increased to 28% in fis
cal 2024 from 24% in fiscal 2023. The increase in gross margin in fiscal 2024 was due to additional revenues, a favorable product mix, and a sharp improvement in Neeltran project margins.

Operating Expenses

Research and development

Research and development (“R&D”) expenses increased by
 43% to $11.4 million, or 5% of revenue in fiscal 
2024
, compared to $8.0 million, or 5% of revenue, in fiscal 2023. 
The increase
 in R&D expenses is primarily a result of additional total compensation and stock compensation expense due in part to additional employees as a result of the acquisition of NWL.

Selling, general, and administrative

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased by 36% to $43.1 million, or 19%
 of rev
enue in fiscal 2024 from $31.6 million, or 22% of revenue, in fiscal 2023. The increase in SG&A expenses is primarily a result of higher total compensation expense, additional stock compensation expense and acquisition costs related to the acquisition of NWL.

Amortization of acquisition related intangibles

We recorded $1.7 million in fiscal 2024 and $2.2 million in fiscal 2023 in amortization expense related to our core technology and know-how, customer relationships, and other intangible assets. The decrease in amortization expense is primarily a result of using the economic consumption method as the basis to amortize the acquired customer relationship intangible assets related to NEPSI and Neeltran, partially offset by the increase related to amortization of NWL related intangibles.

Change in fair value of contingent consideration

The change in fair value of our contingent consideration for the earnout payment on the acquisition of NEPSI resulted in a loss of $3.4 million resulting from an increase in fair value in fiscal 2024, and $4.9 million during fiscal 2023. During fiscal 2024, we issued 300,000 shares of our common stock to the selling stockholders following certification of the achievement of specified earnout revenue objectives. We also recorded a $3.3 million payment relating to the acquisition of NWL, as a payment to settle the remaining obligations after the acquisition. The value of this contingent consideration was de minimis at the Acquisition Date and the resulting change in fair value was recorded in September 2024 when the payment was calculated and paid.

Our Grid business segment generated operating income o
f $1.8 million in fiscal 
2024
 and operating loss of $6.9 million in fiscal 2023. The improvement in the Grid business segment was due to higher revenues and gross margins in fiscal 2024, compared to fiscal 2023.

The Wind segment generated operating income of $3.8 m
illion in fiscal 2024 and $0.4 million in fiscal 2023. 
The increase in the Wind business segment operating income was due to higher revenue and gross margins in fiscal 2024, compared to fiscal 2023.

Unallocated corporate expenses consisted of a loss on contingent consideration of $6.7 million in fiscal 2024, and a loss on contingent consideration of $4.9 million in 
fiscal 2023
.

Interest income, net

Interest income, net was $3.7 million in fiscal 2024 compared to $1.3 million for fiscal 2023. The increase in interest income, net, was primarily due to higher cash balances in fiscal 2024.

Other expense, net

Oth
er expense, ne
t was $0.3 million in fiscal 2024, compared to $0.7 million in fiscal 2023. The decrease in other expense was driven by the impacts of more favorable fluctuations in foreign currencies in fiscal 2024, compared to fiscal 2023.

Income Taxes

We recorded an income tax benefit of $3.7 million in fiscal 2024, compared to income tax expense of $0.3 million in fiscal 2023. The net improvement in income tax is a result of the release of the valuation allowance due to the recording of the deferred tax liability from the acquisition of NWL.

Net income (loss)

Net income was $6.0 million in fiscal 2024, compared to net loss of $11.1 million in fiscal 2023. The improvement in net income was driven primarily by higher revenues and gross margins in fiscal 2024 and other factors described above.

Please refer to the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A, for a discussion of certain factors that may affect our future results of operations and financial condition.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure - Non-GAAP Net Income

Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance, financial position or cash flow that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The non-GAAP measures included in this Form 10-K, however, should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to the comparable measure prepared in accordance with GAAP.

      41

We define non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) before stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, change in fair value of contingent consideration, acquisition costs, and other non-cash or unusual charges. We believe non-GAAP net income assists management and investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding these non-cash charges and other items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. In addition, we use non-GAAP net income as a factor to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies. A 
reconciliation of
 GAAP net income (loss) to non-GAAP net income is set forth in the table below (in thousands, except per share data):

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash provided by operating activities, our cash and cash equivalents on hand, along with access to capital markets. The Company believes that these sources of liquidity provide adequate liquidity to meet both its short-term and reasonably foreseeable long-term requirements and obligations. At March 31, 2025, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $85.4 million, compared to $92.3 million at March 31, 2024, a decrease of $6.9 million. As of March 31, 2025, we had approximately $4.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in foreign bank accounts. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are summarized as follows (in thousands):

Net cash provided by operating activities was
 $28.3 m
illion compared to net cash used in operating activities of $2.1 million in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
The increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 
2024
 compared to fiscal 2023 was driven primarily by higher gross margins, favorable changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses, relief of deferred revenue, increased non-cash expenses like stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, and change in fair value of contingent consideration, offset by decreased cash collections, increased prepaid balances, and change in deferred income taxes. 

Net cash used in investing activities was $35.2 million and $1.0 million in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively.
 The increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 
2024
 compared to fiscal 2023 was due primarily to
 cash paid for the acquisition of NWL.

Net cash provided by financing activities was less than $0.1 million compared to $65.4 million in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively.
 The decrease in cash provided by financing activities 
was primarily related to net proceeds received from an equity offering in fiscal 2023, while the Company had no equity offerings in fiscal 2024.

At March 31, 2025, we had $4.3 million of restricted cash included in long-term assets and $1.6 million of restricted cash in current assets. At March 31, 2024, we had $1.3 million of restricted cash included in long-term assets and $0.5 million of restricted cash in current assets. These amounts included in restricted cash primarily represent collateral deposits to secure surety bonds and letters of credit for various customer contracts. These deposits are held in interest bearing accounts.

In January 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that will expire three years from the date on which it was declared effective, March 15, 2027 (the “Form S-3”). The Form S-3 allows us to offer and sell from time-to-time up to $250 million of common stock, debt securities, warrants or units comprised of any combination of these securities. The Form S-3 is intended to provide us flexibility to conduct registered sales of our securities, subject to market conditions, in order to fund our future capital needs. The terms of any future offering under the Form S-3 will be established at the time of such offering and will be described in a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC prior to the completion of any such offering.

On August 1, 2024, we entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement with the selling stockholders named therein. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement and concurrently with entering into such agreement, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Megatran, for the Purchase Price of $61.4 million, which consideration amount was subject to various adjustments set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement (including those described below) and consisted of: (a) (i) $25.0 million, minus (ii) the Indebtedness (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) outstanding as of immediately prior to the closing, minus (iii) Company Expenses (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement); (b) a number of restricted shares (rounded up or down to the nearest whole share, as applicable) of our common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) $31.4 million by (y) the closing price per share of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the last trading day immediately preceding the Acquisition Date; and (c) an additional cash payment equal to $5.0 million, as adjusted pursuant to Sections 5.6(c), (d), and (f) of the Stock Purchase Agreement. Megatran is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates, is operated and reported as a component of its Grid business segment. On September 23, 2024, the Company paid $3.3 million to the selling stockholders, which was calculated based on the agreed upon formula set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, there are no remaining obligations to the selling stockholders of Megatran.

In August 2024, the Company filed an automatically-effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that will expire no later than August 12, 2027 (the “Second Form S-3”). The Second Form S-3 allows the Company to offer and sell from time-to-time unspecified amounts of common stock, debt securities, warrants or units comprised of any combination of these securities and allows certain selling stockholders to offer and sell from time-to-time common stock. The Second Form S-3 assisted the Megatran selling stockholders in the resale of their common stock and is intended to provide the Company flexibility to conduct registered sales of its securities, subject to market conditions, in order to fund its future capital needs. The terms of any future offering under the Second Form S-3 will be established at the time of such offering and will be described in a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC prior to the completion of any such offering.

We are a party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain contractual obligations are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2025, while others are considered future commitments. We have various contractual arrangements, under which we have committed to purchase certain minimum quantities of goods or services on an annual basis. For information regarding our other contractual obligations, refer to Note 13, "Contingent Consideration," Note 16, "Leases", and Note 18, "Commitments and Contingencies" to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

      43

We believe we have sufficient available liquidity to fund our operations and capital expenditures for the next twelve months. We may seek to raise additional capital, which could be in the form of loans, convertible debt or equity, to fund our operating requirements and capital expenditures. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms or at all or execute on any other means of improving our liquidity as described above. Additionally. the impact of global sources of instability, including tariffs, trade restrictions and resulting trade conflicts, the ongoing wars between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, instability of financial institutions and political instability in the United States, on the global financial markets may reduce our ability to raise additional capital, if necessary, which could negatively impact our liquidity.

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we are involved in legal and administrative proceedings and claims of various types. We record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We review these estimates each accounting period as additional information is known and adjust the loss provision when appropriate. If a matter is both probable to result in liability and the amounts of loss can be reasonably estimated, we estimate and disclose the possible loss or range of loss to the extent necessary to make the consolidated financial statements not misleading. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements.

    44

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

       The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ under different assumptions or conditions. Our accounting policies that involve the most significant judgments and estimates are as follows:

Revenue recognition 

For certain arrangements, such as contracts to perform research and development, prototype development contracts and certain customized product sales, we record revenues using the over-time method, measured by the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs. Over-time revenue recognition accounting is predominantly used on certain turnkey power systems installations for electric utilities and long-term prototype development contracts with the U.S. government.

Significant judgement is required to estimate the total expected costs for projects that typically have a timeline of 12-24 months. Any increase or decrease in estimated costs to complete a performance obligation without a corresponding change to the contract price could impact the calculation of cumulative revenue to date and gross profit on the project. Factors that may result in a change to our estimate include delays in manufacturing, unforeseen engineering problems, the performance of subcontractors and material suppliers, among others.

We have a long history of working with multiple types of projects and preparing cost estimates, and we rely on the expertise of key personnel to prepare what we believe are reasonable best estimates given available facts and circumstances. Due to the nature of the work involved, however, judgment is involved to estimate the total costs to complete, and the amounts estimated could have a material impact on the revenue we recognize in each accounting period. We cannot estimate unforeseen events and circumstances which may result in actual results being materially different from previous estimates.

See Note 4, “Revenue Recognition,” for additional information.

Business Acquisitions

We account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805, 
Business Combinations
. The purchase price for each acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets, if identified, are also recorded.

Determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions as well as the use of specialists as needed. The Company utilizes management estimates and an independent third-party valuation firm to assist in determining the fair values of assets acquired, including intangible assets and liabilities assumed. The primary intangible assets acquired include customer relationship and trade names. Intangible assets are initially valued using a methodology commensurate with the intended use of the asset. The fair value of customer relationships is measured using the multi-period excess earnings method (“MPEEM”). The fair value of the trade names is measured using a relief-from-royalty (“RFR”) approach. The basis for future sales projections for both the MPEEM and RFR are based on internal revenue forecasts which the Company believes represents reasonable market participant assumptions. The future cash flows are discounted using an applicable discount rate. The key uncertainties in the calculations, as applicable, are the selection of an appropriate royalty rate, assumptions used in developing estimates of future cash flows, including revenue growth and expense forecasts, assumed customer attrition rates, as well as perceived risks associated with those forecasts in determining the discount rate. There is inherent uncertainty in forecasted cash flows and therefore, actual results may differ and could result in a subsequent impairment charge of acquired intangibles and/or goodwill.

The consideration for our acquisitions may include future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a particular event. We record a contingent consideration obligation for such contingent consideration payments at fair value on the acquisition date. We estimate the fair value of contingent consideration obligations through valuation models that incorporate probability adjusted assumptions related to the achievement of the milestones and the likelihood of making related payments. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the fair value of contingent consideration recorded at each reporting period.

    45

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets of acquired businesses that are consolidated. We perform our annual assessment of goodwill on February 28th of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances or a triggering event indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An entity is permitted to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform a goodwill impairment test. Significant judgment is required to determine if an indication of impairment has taken place. Factors to be considered include the following: adverse change in operating results, decline in strategic business plans, significantly lower future cash flows, and sustainable declines in market data such as market capitalization. The quantitative impairment test is required only if the entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit, using a methodology which combines an income approach, using a discounted cash flow method, with a market approach. The income approach includes estimates and assumptions about revenue growth rates, operating margins and terminal growth rates, discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital derived from other publicly-traded companies that are similar but not identical from an operational and economic standpoint. These estimates are based on historical experiences, our projects of future operating activity and our weighted-average cost of capital. A significant change in events, circumstances or any of these assumptions could adversely affect these estimates, which could result in an impairment. 

We performed our annual assessment of goodwill on February 28, 2025 including a quantitative assessment of our goodwill balance acquired from our acquisition of Neeltran, and a qualitative assessment of all other reporting units goodwill, 
and determined that there was no impairment to goodwill. 
See Note 5, “Goodwill,” for further information regarding our goodwill valuation assumptions.

Income taxes

Our provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current fiscal year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse. All deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented as non-current in the consolidated balance sheets.

We regularly assess our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. Assessments of the realization of deferred tax assets require that management consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, and make significant judgments about many factors, including the amount and likelihood of future taxable income. Based on all the available evidence, we have recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realizable due to the taxable losses that have been incurred since our inception and uncertainty around our future profitability.

Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. See Note 14, “Income Taxes,” of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our income tax assumptions and expenses.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of American Superconductor Corporation

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Superconductor Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended March 31, 2025, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended March 31, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control
—
Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated May 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit

Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

      47

Over-Time Revenue Recognition

As described in Notes 3 and 4 of the consolidated financial statements, for certain arrangements, such as contracts to perform research and development, prototype development contracts and certain customized product sales, the Company records revenues using the over-time method, measured by the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs. The ability to reliably estimate total estimated contract costs is challenging, especially on long-term prototype development contracts, and may require significant analysis and judgments by management, including evaluating customer change orders, to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize.

We identified revenue recognition pertaining to customer contracts satisfied over-time as a critical audit matter as there are significant judgments exercised by management in determining total estimated contract costs used in determining revenue recognition. Given the high degree of management judgment involved in various cost estimates that are used in the revenue calculations, the audit effort required to evaluate management’s judgments in determining revenue recognition for the Company’s contracts was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment.

Our audit procedures related to revenue recognition included the following, among others:

●

We obtained an understanding of the relevant internal controls related to revenue recognition and tested the design and operating effectiveness of those internal controls including management’s review control over the assumptions and key inputs used to recognize over-time revenue.

●

We selected a sample of contracts with customers and related revenue transactions and performed the following audit procedures:

o

Obtained customer contract, customer change orders (as applicable), related invoices, purchase orders, and management revenue recognition analysis for each testing selection, to evaluate if relevant contractual terms and transaction price were appropriately considered by management and conclusions on revenue recognition method were in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance.

o

Assessed the validity of data used in the model for completeness and accuracy by comparing selected items from the underlying budget to the source information used to develop the contract budget and agreeing, on a sample basis, costs incurred to source documents.

o

Evaluated management’s estimations of total contract cost by assessing actual costs to date against projections made throughout the course of the contract term.

Valuation of Certain Tangible and Intangible Assets in Business Combination

As described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of Megatran Industries, Inc. on August 1, 2024, for total consideration of $61.4 million. The Company accounted for this transaction under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the total consideration paid was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including identified intangible assets and land. The Company estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets using the multi-period excess earnings method, which required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth and expense forecasts, customer attrition rates, and the selection of discount rates. The Company also made significant judgments regarding the estimates used to determine the fair value of the acquired land.

We identified the valuation of the identified intangible assets and land as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management used in the fair value determination. Auditing management’s forecasted revenue growth and expenses, customer attrition rates, selection of the discount rates, and the fair value of acquired land required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures, including the use of our valuation specialists.

Our audit procedures related to the determination of the fair value of identified intangible assets and land, included the following, among others:

●

We obtained an understanding of the relevant internal controls related to the valuation of the identified intangible assets and land and tested the design and operating effectiveness of those internal controls including management’s review control over the assumptions and key inputs used in the purchase price allocation.

●

We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s revenue growth and expenses forecasts and customer attrition rates by comparing the projections to historical results as well as industry benchmarks.

●

With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we:

o

Evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s valuation methodologies

o

Tested the source information underlying the determination of the discount rates and verified the accuracy of the calculations.

o

Tested the relevance and reliability of source information underlying the determination of fair value of the acquired land and compared to available market data.

o

Developed an independent estimate of the fair value of the acquired land and compared to management’s estimate.

Neeltran Goodwill Valuation Impairment Assessment

As described in Notes 3 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, management tests goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, as of February 28 of each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the goodwill asset might be impaired. The Company first assesses qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative impairment test is required only if the entity concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment was performed as of February 28, 2025, for the Company’s goodwill balance resulting from its acquisition of Neeltran, Inc. To test goodwill quantitatively for impairment, management compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with the carrying amount of each reporting unit, including the recorded goodwill. In estimating the fair value of each reporting unit, management uses a methodology which combines an income approach, using a discounted cash flows method, with a market approach.

We identified the goodwill impairment assessment for the Company’s Neeltran reporting unit as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions used by management when estimating the fair value of this reporting unit, including management’s forecasts of revenue growth rates, operating margins and terminal growth rates as well as management’s selection of the discount rates. Auditing the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions involved a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort, including the use of our valuation specialists.

Our audit procedures related to the assessment of Neeltran goodwill impairment included the following, among others:

●

We obtained an understanding of the relevant internal controls related to management’s goodwill impairment assessment and tested the design and operating effectiveness of those internal controls including management’s review control over the significant assumptions in the goodwill impairment assessment.

●

We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts of revenue growth rates and operating margins by comparing the projections to historical results.

●

We tested the underlying data used by management in their development of forecasts of revenue growth rates and operating margins for accuracy and completeness.

●

We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s selection of comparable entities with similar operations and economic characteristics.

●

With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we:

o

Evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rate and multiple of earnings used in management’s assessment by comparing the underlying source information to publicly available market data and verifying the accuracy of the calculations

o

Evaluated the appropriateness of the valuation methods used by management and tested their mathematical accuracy.

 Nature of the Business and Operations and Liquidity

Nature of the Business and Operations

American Superconductor Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “AMSC®” or the “Company”) was founded on 
 April 
9,

1987.
 The Company is a leading system provider of megawatt-scale power resiliency solutions that orchestrate the rhythm and harmony of power on the grid™ and protect and expand the capability of the Navy's fleet. The Company’s system level products leverage its proprietary “smart materials” and “smart software and controls” to provide enhanced resiliency and improved performance of megawatt-scale power flow.

These consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC”) instructions to Form 
10
-K. Certain prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the presentation in the current period. The going concern basis of presentation assumes that the Company will continue operations and will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in entities in which we do 
not
 have a controlling interest are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 

Liquidity

The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash provided by operating activities, our cash and cash equivalents on hand, along with access to capital markets. The Company believes that these sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet both its short-term and reasonably foreseeable long-term requirements and obligations. At 
 March 31, 2025
, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $
79.5
 million. Cash provided by operations for the year ended 
 March 31, 2025
 was $
28.3
 million.

On 
 August 
1,

2024
 (the "Acquisition Date"), the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with the selling stockholders named therein. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement and concurrently with entering into such agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Megatran Industries, Inc. ("Megatran") (the "Acquisition"), for aggregate consideration in an amount equal to $
61.4
 million (the “Purchase Price”), which consideration amount was subject to various adjustments set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement (including those described below) and consisted of: (a) (i) $
25.0
 million, minus (ii) the Indebtedness (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) outstanding as of immediately prior to the closing, minus (iii) Company Expenses (as defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement) (collectively, the “Cash Purchase Price”); (b) a number of restricted shares (rounded up or down to the nearest whole share, as applicable) (the “Company Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, $.
01
 par value per share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (
x
) $
31.4
 million (the “Share Purchase Price”) by (y) the closing price per share of common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the last trading day immediately preceding the Acquisition Date; and (c) an additional cash payment equal to $
5.0
 million, as adjusted pursuant to Sections 
5.6
(c), (d), and (f) of the Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Additional Cash Purchase Price”). Megatran is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and, together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliates, is operated and reported as a component of its Grid business segment. On the Acquisition Date, the Company paid to Megatran's selling stockholders $
25.0
 million in cash on hand, and 
1,297,600
 restricted shares of common stock. On 
 September 23, 2024, 
the Company paid $
3.3
 million to the selling stockholders, which was calculated based on the agreed upon formula set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. As of 
 March 31, 2025, 
there are 
no
 remaining obligations to the selling stockholders of Megatran. Throughout the financial statements and related footnotes, this is referred to as the "acquisition of NWL".

In 
 January 2024, 
we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-
3
 that will expire 
three
 years from the date on which it was declared effective, 
 March 15, 2027 (
the “Form S-
3”
). The Form S-
3
 allows us to offer and sell from time-to-time up to $
250
 million of common stock, debt securities, warrants or units comprised of any combination of these securities. The Form S-
3
 is intended to provide us flexibility to conduct registered sales of our securities, subject to market conditions, in order to fund our future capital needs. The terms of any future offering under the Form S-
3
 will be established at the time of such offering and will be described in a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC prior to the completion of any such offering.

 August 2024, 
the Company filed an automatically-effective shelf registration statement on Form S-
3
 that will expire 
no
 later than 
 August 12, 2027 (
the “Second Form S-
3”
). The Second Form S-
3
 allows the Company to offer and sell from time-to-time unspecified amounts of common stock, debt securities, warrants or units comprised of any combination of these securities and allows certain selling stockholders to offer and sell from time-to-time common stock. The Second Form S-
3
 assisted the Megatran selling stockholders in the resale of their common stock and is intended to provide the Company flexibility to conduct registered sales of its securities, subject to market conditions, in order to fund its future capital needs. The terms of any future offering under the Second Form S-
3
 will be established at the time of such offering and will be described in a prospectus supplement filed with the SEC prior to the completion of any such offering.

     The Company believes that based on the information presented above and its annual management assessment, it has sufficient liquidity to fund its operations and capital expenditures for the next

twelve
 months following the issuance of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended

 March 31, 2025
. The impact of global sources of instability on the global financing markets

 may 
reduce the Company's ability to raise additional capital, if necessary, which could negatively impact the Company's liquidity.  There can be

no
 assurance that the Company will be able to continue to raise additional capital, on favorable terms or at all, from other sources or execute on any other means of improving liquidity described above.

 Acquisition

Acquisition of NWL

As described in Note 
1,
 Nature of the Business and Operations and Liquidity, on the Acquisition Date, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Megatran. Megatran's wholly-owned subsidiary, NWL, Inc. ("NWL"), is a U.S.-based global provider of engineered power conversion solutions for demanding industrial and military applications.

The Acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with ASC 
805,

Business Combinations
. The Company allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the Acquisition Date. The excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill.

The total purchase price of approximately $
61.4
 million includes the fair value of shares of the Company’s common stock issued at closing, and cash paid, as follows (in millions):

Cash payments
$
30.0

Issuance of 
1,297,600
 shares of Company’s common stock
$
31.4

At the Acquisition Date, in addition to the $
30.0
 million cash, the Company valued the Company’s common stock, using $
24.16
 per share, which was the closing price on the day prior to the day that the Company acquired Megatran. Acquisition costs of $
1.1
 million were included in selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") for the 
fiscal year ended 
 March 31, 2025
.

The fair value of the financial assets acquired includes receivables with a fair value of $
16.1
 million. The gross amount due is $
16.9
 million, of which $
0.8
 million is expected to be uncollectible.

Inventory includes a $
0.7
 million adjustment to step up the inventory balance to fair value consistent with the purchase price allocation. The fair value was determined based on the estimated selling price of the inventory, less the remaining manufacturing and selling cost and a normal profit margin on those manufacturing and selling efforts. The inventory step up adjustment increased cost of revenue $
0.7
 million for the 
fiscal year ended 
 March 31, 2025
 as the inventory was sold.

Backlog of $
0.7
 million was evaluated using the multi period excess earnings method under the income approach. The contracts with customers do 
not
 provide for any guarantees to source all future requirements from the Company. The amortization method being utilized is economic consumption estimated over an 
eight
-month period with the expense being allocated to cost of revenues.

Customer relationships of $
1.3
 million relates to customers currently under contract and was determined based on a multi period excess earnings method under the income approach. The method of amortization being utilized is straight line over 
10
 years, as the results were 
not
 materially different from the economic consumption method, with the expense being allocated to SG&A.

56

Goodwill represents the value associated with the acquired workforce and expected synergies related to the business combination of the 
two
 companies. Goodwill resulting from the Acquisition was assigned to the Company’s Grid business segment. Goodwill recognized in the Acquisition is 
not
 deductible for tax purposes. This purchase price allocation is preliminary and has 
not
 been finalized as the analysis on the assets and liabilities acquired, primarily the tax related liability, 
 may 
require further adjustments to our purchase accounting that could result in a measurement period adjustment that would impact the Company's reported net assets and goodwill as of 
 August 1, 2024. 
Material changes, if any, to the preliminary allocation summarized above will be reported once the related uncertainties are resolved, but 
no
 later than 
 August 1, 2025. 
The deferred tax liability initially valued at $
6.4
 million is primarily related to basis difference of property, plant, and equipment. As of 
 March 31, 2025 
based on basis differences identified through the finalization of NWL’s pre-acquisition tax returns as well as a true up of state tax rates, a reduction in the deferred tax liability of $
0.8
 million was recorded in the 
three
 months ended 
 March 31, 2025. 
This decreased the balance to $
5.6
 million, and the offsetting reduction was recorded to Goodwill, decreasing the balance to $
4.7
 million.

 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. 

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are 
not
 readily apparent from other sources. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, business combinations, tax reserves, and deferred tax assets. Provisions for depreciation are based on their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Some of these estimates can be subjective and complex and, consequently, actual results 
 may 
differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While for any given estimate or assumption made by the Company’s management there 
 may 
be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable, the Company believes that, given the current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable estimate or assumption would materially impact the financial statements.

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments with maturities of 
three
 months or less that are regarded as high quality, low risk investments and are measured using such inputs as quoted prices, and are classified within Level 
1
 of the valuation hierarchy. Cash equivalents consist principally of certificates of deposits and money market accounts.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable consist of amounts owed by commercial companies and government agencies. Accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for credit losses. The Company’s accounts receivable relate principally to a limited number of customers. As of 
 March 31, 2025
, Innomotics, LLC.
, accounted for approximately 
22
% of the Company's accounts receivable balance, with 
no
 other customers accounting for greater than 
10%
 of the balance. As of 
 March 31, 
2024
, 
Capital Power
 and INOX Wind Limited accounted for approximately 
14
% and 
12
% of the Company's accounts receivable balance, respectively, with 
no
 other customers accounting for greater than 
10%
 of the balance. 
Changes in the financial condition or operations of the Company’s customers 
 may 
result in delayed payments or non-payments which would adversely impact its cash flows from operating activities and/or its results of operations. As such, the Company 
 may 
require collateral, advanced payment or other security based upon the customer history and/or creditworthiness. In determining the allowance for credit losses, the Company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based primarily on the probability of recoverability based on historical collection and write-off experience, the age of past due receivables, specific customer circumstances, and current economic trends. The Company has 
not
 recorded an allowance for credit losses as of each of the years ended 
 March 31, 2025
 and 
2024
. If the financial condition of the Company’s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment, additional allowances 
 may 
be required. Failure to accurately estimate the losses for credit losses and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

Inventory

Inventories include material, direct labor and related manufacturing overhead, and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a 
first
-in, 
first
-out basis, or net realizable value determined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The Company records inventory when it takes delivery and title to the product according to the terms of each supply contract.

58

Program costs 
 may 
be deferred and recorded as inventory on contracts on which costs are incurred in excess of approved contractual amounts and/or funding, if future recovery of the costs is deemed probable.

At each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates its ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence. Inventories that management considers excess or obsolete are reserved. Management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining excess and obsolescence and net realizable value adjustments. Once inventory is written down and a new cost basis is established, it is 
not
 written back up if demand increases.

For the fiscal years ended 
 March 31, 2025
 and 
2024
, the Company recorded inventory reserves of approximately $
1.5
 million and $
2.0
 million, respectively, based on evaluating its ending inventory on hand for excess quantities and obsolescence.

Leases

The Company determines whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception of a contract. The Company defines a lease as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of identified property or equipment (an identified asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control over the use of the identified asset means that the Company has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right to direct the use of the asset. 

Leases include all agreements in which the Company obtains control of a physical asset.  Leases are captured on the balance sheet as both a right of use asset and associated lease liability and are valued based on the commencement of the Company's control of the asset, after being discounted by its incremental borrowing rate. The Company's lease portfolio is made up primarily of real estate leases for its various offices, but also include items such as vehicles, IT equipment and other miscellaneous tools and equipment needed for manufacturing. The Company's incremental borrowing rate was determined through an analysis to identify what rates it could obtain if the Company were to secure external financing for similar transactions, and includes considerations of both the market and its current credit ratings. An analysis is performed annually, or upon execution of any individually material agreement, to ensure that the rates being applied to newly acquired leases are still accurate. 

The majority of the Company's leases are classified as operating leases, and therefore the expense is captured in operating loss from operations each period.

The Company has elected to exclude all leases of less than 
twelve
 months from the balance sheet presentation. The Company has also elected a policy in which the Company will 
not
 segregate lease components from non-lease components, so in the event the Company executes an agreement which includes a non-lease component its asset and liability recorded to the balance sheet will include the value of that non-lease component as well.  This policy will be applied to all classifications of leases.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Company accounts for depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method to allocate the cost of property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives as follows:

Asset Classification

Estimated Useful Life in Years

Building

40

Equipment and software

3
-
10

Furniture and fixtures

3
-
5

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining lease term

59

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or other disposition of assets, the costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operating expenses.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets or asset group that is held and used, including intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets 
 may 
not
 be recoverable. Under the held and used approach, the asset or asset group to be tested for impairment should represent the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. The Company evaluates its long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets 
 may 
not
 be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted future cash flows.

There was 
no
 impairment indicators during the fiscal years ended 
 March 31, 2025
 and 
2024
.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets of acquired businesses that are consolidated. The Company performs its annual assessment of goodwill on 
 February 
28th
 of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances or a triggering event indicate that the carrying amount 
 may 
not
 be recoverable. Determining whether a triggering event has occurred often involves significant judgment from management. An entity is permitted to 
first
 assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform a goodwill impairment test. The quantitative impairment test is required only if the entity concludes that it is more likely than 
not
 that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. The Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit, using a methodology which combines an income approach, using a discounted cash flow method, with a market approach. In evaluating whether it is more likely than 
not
 that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, an entity should consider the totality of all relevant events or circumstances that affect the fair value or carrying amount of a reporting unit.  If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, then an impairment charge is recognized reducing the goodwill by the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value, 
not
 to exceed the total amount of the goodwill allocated to the that reporting unit. See Note 
5,
 "Goodwill" for further information and discussion.

The Company performed its annual assessment of goodwill on 
 February 28, 
2025
, and determined that there was 
no
 impairment to goodwill.

Revenue Recognition 

Revenue contracts are defined as an arrangement that creates enforceable rights and obligations of both parties where collection of the contract price is deemed probable. 
The Company records revenue based on a 
five
-step model which includes confirmation of contract existence, identifying the performance obligations, determining the transaction price, allocating the contract transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizing the revenue when (or as) control of goods or services is transferred to the customer. The transfer of control 
 can occur at the time of delivery, installation or post-installation where applicable.  

The Company's equipment and system product line includes certain contracts which do 
not
 meet the requirements of an exchange transaction and therefore do 
not
 fall within the scope of Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 
606.

60

For certain arrangements, such as contracts to perform research and development, prototype development contracts and certain customized product sales, the Company records revenues using the over-time method, measured by the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs. Over-time revenue recognition accounting is predominantly used on certain turnkey power systems installations for electric utilities and long-term prototype development contracts with the U.S. government. The Company follows this method when any of the 
three
 following criteria are met: when the customer receives the benefits as they are performed, control transfers to the customer as the work is performed, or there is 
no
 alternative use to the Company and there is an enforceable right to payment through the life of the contract. However, the ability to reliably estimate total costs at completion is challenging, especially on long-term prototype development contracts, and could result in future changes in contract estimates. For contracts where reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs cannot be made, the Company follows the point in time method. In addition, 
some contracts contain an element of variable consideration, including liquidated damages and/or penalties, which requires payment to the customer in the event that delivery timelines or milestones are 
not
 met. The Company estimates the total consideration payable by the customer when the contracts contain variable consideration provisions, based on the most likely amount anticipated to be recognized for transferring the promised goods or services. As a result, the Company 
 may 
constrain revenue to the extent that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will 
not
 occur until the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.

The Company enters into sales arrangements that 
 may 
provide for multiple performance obligations to a customer. Sales of certain products 
 may 
include extended warranty and support or service packages, and at times include performance bonds. As these contracts progress, the Company continually assesses the probability of a payout from the performance bond. Should the Company determine that such a payout is likely, the Company would record a liability. The Company would reduce revenue to the extent a liability is recorded. In addition, the Company enters into licensing arrangements that include training services.

Performance obligations are separated into more than 
one
 unit of accounting when (
1
) the delivered element(s) have value to the customer on a stand-alone basis, and (
2
) the Company's promise to transfer the goods or services to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.  In general, revenues are separated between the different product shipments which have stand-alone value, and the various services to be provided. Revenue for product shipments is generally recognized at a point in time where control of the product is transferred to the customer, while revenues for the services are generally recognized over the period of performance. The Company identifies all goods and/or services that are to be delivered separately under a sales arrangement and 
allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation using the respective standalone selling price ("SSP") which is determined primarily using the cost plus expected margin approach for products and a relief from royalty method for licenses.  Revenue allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. 
The Company reviews SSP and the related margins at least annually. 
The Company has elected to recognize revenue based on the as invoiced practical expedient if there is a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the Company's performance.

The Company’s license agreements provide either for the payment of contractually determined paid-up front license fees or milestone based payments in consideration for the grant of rights to manufacture and/or sell products using its patented technologies or know-how. Some of these agreements provide for the release of the licensee from past and future intellectual property infringement claims. When the Company can determine that it has 
no
 further obligations other than the grant of the license and that the Company has fully transferred the technology know-how, the Company recognizes the revenue under a point in time model. In other license arrangements, the Company 
 may 
also agree to provide training services to transfer the technology know-how. In these arrangements, the Company has determined that the licenses have 
no
 standalone value to the customer and are 
not
 separable from training services as the Company can only fully transfer the technology know-how through the training component. Accordingly, the Company accounts for these arrangements as a single unit of accounting, and recognizes revenue over the period of its performance using the over-time method. Costs for these arrangements are expensed as incurred.

Existing customers are subject to ongoing credit evaluations based on payment history and other factors. If it is determined that collectability of any portion of the contract value is 
not
 probable, an analysis of variable consideration will be performed using either the most likely amount or expected value method to determine the amount of revenue that must be constrained until the scenario causing the variability has been resolved. For contractual arrangements that involve variable consideration, the Company recognizes revenue for these amounts upon reaching the constraining event successfully. The Company does 
not
 generally provide for extended payment terms or provide its customers with a right of return.

61

Infrequently, the Company receives requests from customers to hold product being purchased from us for a valid business purpose. The Company recognizes revenues for such arrangements provided the transaction meets, at a minimum, the following criteria: a valid business purpose for the arrangement exists; risk of ownership of the purchased product has been transferred to the buyer; there is a fixed delivery date that is reasonable and consistent with the buyer’s business purpose; the product is ready for shipment; there are 
no
 continuing performance obligation in regards to the purchased product and these products have been segregated from the Company's inventories and cannot be used to fill other orders received. During the fiscal years ended 
 March 31, 2025
 and 
2024
 there were 
no
 such held transactions. 

The Company has elected to record taxes collected from customers on a net basis and does 
not
 include tax amounts in revenue or costs of revenue.

The Company’s contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to the timing differences between cash received from a customer in connection with contractual rights to invoicing and the timing of revenue recognition following completion of performance obligations. The Company's accounts receivable balance is made up entirely of customer contract related balances. 

Business Acquisitions

The Company accounts for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with ASC 
805,

Business Combinations
. The purchase price for each acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets, if identified, are also recorded at fair value.  The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.

Determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities assumed is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions as well as the use of specialists as needed.

The consideration for its acquisitions 
 may 
include future payments that are contingent upon the occurrence of a particular event. The Company records a contingent consideration obligation for such contingent consideration payments at fair value on the acquisition date. The Company estimates the fair value of contingent consideration obligations through valuation models that incorporate probability adjusted assumptions related to the achievement of the milestones and the likelihood of making related payments, refer to Note 
13
 for further information regarding valuation methodology and assumptions. Each period the Company revalues the contingent consideration obligations associated with the acquisition to fair value and records changes in the fair value within the operating expenses in its consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes in assumed revenue risk premium and volatility, as well as changes in the stock price and assumed probability with respect to the attainment of certain financial and operational metrics, among others. Significant judgment is employed in determining these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period. Accordingly, future business and economic conditions, as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above, can materially impact the fair value of contingent consideration recorded at each reporting period.

Product Warranty

Warranty obligations are incurred in connection with the sale of the Company’s products. The Company provides assurance-type warranties on all product sales for a term of typically 
one
 to 
three
 years, and extended service-type warranties at the customers’ option for an additional term ranging up to 
four
 additional years. The Company accrues for the estimated warranty costs for assurance warranties at the time of sale based on historical warranty experience plus any known or expected changes in warranty exposure. For all extended service-type warranties, the Company recognizes the revenue ratably over time during the effective period of the service.  The costs incurred to provide for these warranty obligations are estimated and recorded as an accrued liability at the time of sale. Future warranty costs are estimated based on historical performance rates and related costs to repair given products. The accounting estimate related to product warranty involves judgment in determining future estimated warranty costs. Should actual performance rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revision to the estimated warranty liability would be required.

62

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Income Taxes

The Company’s provision for income taxes is comprised of a current and a deferred portion. The current income tax provision is calculated as the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current fiscal year. The deferred income tax provision is calculated for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry-forwards using expected tax rates in effect in the years during which the differences are expected to reverse.

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future fiscal years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each fiscal year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Company has provided a valuation allowance against its U.S., Poland, and Romania deferred income tax assets since the Company believes that it is more likely than 
not
 that these deferred tax assets are 
not
 currently realizable due to uncertainty around profitability in the future.

Accounting for income taxes requires a 
two
-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The 
first
 step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than 
not
 that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The 
second
 step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 
50%
 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but 
not
 limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. The Company includes interest and penalties related to gross unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes. See Note 
14,
 “Income Taxes,” for further information regarding its income tax assumptions and expenses.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based payment transactions using a fair value-based method and recognizes the related expense in the results of operations.

Stock-based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award. The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined by reference to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of option awards with service and performance conditions. For awards with service conditions only, the Company recognizes compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service/vesting period. For awards with performance conditions, estimates of compensation cost are made based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions. The cumulative effect of changes in the probability outcomes are recorded in the period in which the changes occur.

Determining the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatilities of the Company’s common stock and expected terms. The expected volatility rates are estimated based on historical and implied volatilities of the Company’s common stock. The expected term represents the average time that the options that vest are expected to be outstanding based on the vesting provisions and the Company’s historical exercise, cancellation and expiration patterns.

The Company estimates pre-vesting forfeitures when recognizing compensation expense based on historical and forward-looking factors. Changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience 
 may 
result in significant, unanticipated increases or decreases in stock-based compensation expense from period to period. The termination of employment of certain employees who hold large numbers of stock-based awards 
 may 
also have a significant, unanticipated impact on forfeiture experience and, therefore, on stock-based compensation expense. The Company will update these assumptions on at least an annual basis and on an interim basis if significant changes to the assumptions are warranted.

The Company accounts 
for share-based payments made to non-employees 
in the same manner as other share-based payments for employees, with the measurement being based on the fair value at the grant date. The non-employee share based payments will be included within the Company's stock compensation currently reported.

63

Equity Method Investments

The Company treats the equity investment in the consolidated financial statements under the equity method. Equity method investments are equity securities in entities we do 
not
 control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting in accordance with ASC 
323,

Investments 
—
 Equity Method and Joint Ventures
. Equity method investments are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus the Company’s share of an investee’s income or loss, less distributions received.

Computation of Net Income (Loss) per Common Share

Basic net loss per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed in periods of net income, by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period, calculated using the treasury stock method. Common equivalent shares include the effect of restricted stock, exercise of stock options and warrants and contingently issuable shares. For the fiscal years ended 
 March 31, 2025
, common equivalent shares of

468,815
 were 
not
 included in the calculation of diluted EPS as they were considered antidilutive. Of these, 
468,652
 were shares of performance-based restricted stock where the contingency was 
not
 met, and 
163
 were awards that were considered anti-dilutive. For the fiscal years ended 
 March 31, 
2024
, common equivalent shares of

809,949
 were 
not
 included in the calculation of diluted EPS as they were considered antidilutive. Of these, 
509,949
 were shares of performance-based restricted stock where the contingency was 
not
 met, and 
300,000
 relate to shares associated with the derivative liability for which the contingency had 
not
 yet been met. The following table 
reconciles

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currency of all the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, except for AMSC Austria, for which the local currency (Euro) is the functional currency. The assets and liabilities of AMSC Austria are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the period. Cumulative translation adjustments are excluded from net loss and shown as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Net foreign currency gains and losses are included in other expense, net on the consolidated statements of operations and were net losses of $
0.7
 million, for both of the fiscal years ended 
 March 31, 2025
 and 
2024
. The Company has 
no
 restrictions on the foreign exchange activities of its foreign subsidiaries, including the payment of dividends and other distributions.

Risks and Uncertainties

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and would impact future results of operations and cash flows.

The Company invests its available cash in high credit, quality financial instruments and invests primarily in investment-grade marketable securities, including, but 
not
 limited to, government obligations and money market funds.

Several of the Company’s government contracts are being funded incrementally, and as such, are subject to the future authorization, appropriation, and availability of government funding. The Company has a history of successfully obtaining financing under incrementally-funded contracts with the U.S. government and it expects to continue to obtain additional contract modifications in the year ending 
 March 
31,

2026
 and beyond as incremental funding is authorized and appropriated by the government.

Contingencies

From time to time, the Company 
 may 
be involved in legal and administrative proceedings and claims of various types. The Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management reviews these estimates in each accounting period as additional information is known and adjusts the loss provision when appropriate. If the loss is 
not
 probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is 
not
 recorded in the consolidated financial statements. If, with respect to a matter, it is 
not
 both probable to result in liability and the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated, an estimate of possible loss or range of loss is disclosed unless such an estimate cannot be made. The Company does 
not
 recognize gain contingencies until they are realized. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. See Note 
18,
 “Commitments and Contingencies,” for further information.

Disclosure of Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company’s financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and contingent consideration. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, short-term debt, accounts payable, and accrued expenses due to their short nature approximate fair value at 
 March 31, 2025
 and 
2024
. The estimated fair values have been determined through information obtained from market sources and management estimates. Changes in fair value are recorded to other income (expense), net. The fair value for the contingent consideration is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation and subject to revaluation at each balance sheet date. The Company classifies the estimates used to fair value these instruments as Level 
3
 inputs. See Note 
6,
 “Fair Value Measurements” for a full discussion on fair value measurements.

4.
 Revenue Recognition

The Company’s revenues in its Grid segment are derived primarily through enabling the transmission and distribution of power, providing planning services that allow it to identify power grid needs and risks, and developing ship protection systems for the U.S. Navy. The Company’s revenues in its Wind segment are derived primarily through supplying advanced power electronics and control systems, licensing its highly engineered wind turbine designs, and providing extensive customer support services to wind turbine manufacturers. The Company records revenue based on a 
five
-step model in accordance with ASC 
606.
 For its customer contracts, the Company identifies the performance obligations, determines the transaction price, allocates the contract transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizes the revenue when (or as) control of goods or services is transferred to the customer. For the fiscal year ended 
 March 31, 2025
, 
88
% of revenue was recognized at the point in time when control transferred to the customer, with the remainder being recognized over time. For the fiscal year ended 
 March 31, 2024
, 
80
% of revenue was recognized at the point in time when control transferred to the customer, with the remainder being recognized over time. 

In the Company's equipment and system product line, each contract with a customer summarizes each product sold to a customer, which typically represents distinct performance obligations. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation using the respective standalone selling price which is determined primarily using the cost plus expected margin approach and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The majority of the Company’s product sales transfer control to the customer in line with the contracted delivery terms and revenue is recorded at the point in time when title and risk transfer to the customer, which is primarily upon delivery, as the Company has determined that this is the point in time that control transfers to the customer.

In the Company's service and technology development product line, there are several different types of transactions and each begins with a contract with a customer that summarizes each product sold to a customer, which typically represents distinct performance obligations. The technology development transactions are primarily for activities that have 
no
 alternative use and for which a profit can be expected throughout the life of the contract. In these cases, the revenue is recognized over time, but in the instances where the profit cannot be assured throughout the entire contract then the revenue is recognized at a point in time. Each contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation using the respective standalone selling price which is determined primarily using the cost plus expected margin approach. The ongoing service transactions are for service contracts that provide benefit to the customer simultaneously as the Company performs its obligations, and therefore this revenue is recognized ratably over time throughout the effective period of these contracts. The transaction prices on these contracts are allocated based on an adjusted market approach which is re-assessed annually for reasonableness. The field service transactions include contracts for delivery of goods and completion of services made at the customer's requests, which are 
not
 deemed satisfied until the work has been completed and/or the requested goods have been delivered, so all of this revenue is recognized at the point in time when the control changes, and at allocated prices based on the adjusted market approach driven by standard price lists. The royalty transactions are related to certain contract terms on transactions in the Company's equipment and systems product line based on activity as specified in the contracts. The transaction prices of these agreements are calculated based on an adjusted market approach as specified in the contract. The Company reports royalty revenue for usage-based royalties when the sales have occurred. In circumstances when collectability is 
not
 assured and a contract does 
not
 exist under ASC 
606,
 revenue is deferred until a non-refundable payment has been received for substantially all the amount that is due and there are 
no
 further remaining performance obligations.

The Company's service contracts can include a purchase order from a customer for specific goods in which each item is a distinct performance obligation satisfied at a point in time at which control of the goods is transferred to the customer. This transfer occurs based on the contracted delivery terms or when the requested service work has been completed. The transaction price for these goods is allocated based on the adjusted market approach considering similar transactions under similar circumstances. Service contracts are also derived from ongoing maintenance contracts and extended service-type warranty contracts. In these transactions, the Company is contracted to provide an ongoing service over a specified period of time. As the customer is consuming the benefits as the service is being provided the revenue is recognized over time ratably.

The Company’s policy is 
not
 to accept volume discounts, product returns, or rebates and allowances within its contracts. In the event a contract was approved with any of these terms, it would be evaluated for variable consideration, estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related product revenue was recorded.

The Company provides assurance-type warranties on all product sales for a term of typically 
one
 to 
three
 years, and extended service-type warranties are available for purchase at the customer's option for an additional term ranging up to 
four
 additional years. The Company accrues for the estimated warranty costs for assurance warranties at the time of sale based on historical warranty experience plus any known or expected changes in warranty exposure. For all extended service-type warranties, the Company recognizes the revenue ratably over time during the effective period of the services.

66

The Company records revenue net of sales tax, value added tax, excise tax and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities. The Company has elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over the products sold passes to customers and revenue is recognized. The Company has elected to recognize incremental costs of obtaining a contract as expense when incurred except in contracts where the amortization period would exceed 
twelve
 months. As of 
 March 31, 2025
 and 
2024
, the Company's capitalized incremental contract costs were 
not
 material. The Company has elected 
not
 to adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the period of financing is 
twelve
 months or less. The Company has elected to recognize revenue based on the as invoiced practical expedient if there is a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the Company's performance.

The Company’s contracts with customers do 
not
 typically include extended payment terms and 
 may 
include milestone billing over the life of the contract. Payment terms vary by contract type and type of customer and generally range from 
30
 to 
60
 days from delivery.

As of

 and 
 March 31, 2024
, the Company’s contract assets and liabilities primarily relate to the timing differences between cash received from a customer in connection with contractual rights to invoicing and the timing of revenue recognition following completion of performance obligations. The Company's accounts receivable balance is made up entirely of customer contract related balances. Changes in the Company’s contract assets, which are included in “Unbilled accounts receivable” and “De

The Company’s remaining performance obligations represent the unrecognized revenue value of the Company’s contractual commitments. The Company’s performance obligations 
 may 
vary significantly each reporting period based on the timing of major new contractual commitments. As of 
 March 31, 2025
, the Company had outstanding performance obligations on existing contracts under ASC 
606
 to be recognized in the next 
twelve
 months of approximately $
200.9
 million. There are also approximately $
109.4
 million of outstanding performance obligations to be recognized over a period of 
thirteen
 to 
sixty
 months. The remaining performance obligations are subject to customer actions and therefore the timing of revenue recognition cannot be reasona
bly estimated.

 Goodwill

The guidance under ASC 
805
-
30,

Business Combinations
, provides for the recognition of goodwill on the acquisition date measured as the excess of the aggregate consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date amounts of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company's goodwill balance relates to the NWL acquisition in fiscal 
2024,
 the Neeltran acquisition in fiscal 
2021,
 the NEPSI acquisition in fiscal 
2020,
 and Infinia Technology Corporation acquisition in fiscal 
2017
 and is reported in the Grid business segment.  

Goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible net assets when accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Goodwill is 
not
 amortized but reviewed for impairment. Goodwill is reviewed annually on 
 February 
28th
 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill might 
not
 be recoverable. Goodwill increased by $
4.7
 million during the fiscal year ended 
 March 31, 2025
, related to the NWL acquisition. This includes a $
0.8
 million adjustment related to the true up of the deferred tax asset consisting primarily of tax basis differences identified through NWL's final pre-acquisition tax returns. There were 
no
 changes to Goodwill during the fiscal year ended 
 March 31, 
2024
.

The Company performed its annual assessment of goodwill on 
 February 28, 
2025
 and 
determined that there was 
no
 impairment to goodwill.

 Fair Value Measurements

A valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value has been established. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into 
three
 broad levels as follows:

Level 
1

-

Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.

Level 
2

-

Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are 
not
 active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).

Level 
3

-

Unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company develops these inputs based on the best information available, including its own data.

The Company provides a gross presentation of activity within Level 
3
 measurement roll-forward and details of transfers in and out of Level 
1
 and 
2
 measurements.  A change in the hierarchy of an investment from its current level is reflected in the period during which the pricing methodology of such investment changes.  Disclosure of the transfer of securities from Level 
1
 to Level 
2
 or Level 
3
 is made in the event that the related security is significant to total cash and investments.  The Company did 
not
 have any transfers of assets and liabilities from Level 
1,
 Level 
2
 or Level 
3
 of the fair value measurement hierarchy during the year ended 
 March 31, 2025
.

A financial asset’s or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Valuation Techniques

Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments with maturities of 
three
 months or less that are regarded as high quality, low risk investments and are measured using such inputs as quoted prices, and are classified within Level 
1
 of the valuation hierarchy. Cash equivalents consist principally of money market accounts.

Short-term Cash Instruments

Short-term cash instruments consist of highly liquid instruments with maturities of 
three
 months or less that are regarded as high quality, low risk investments and are measured using such inputs as quoted prices in markets that are 
not
 active, and are classified within Level 
2
 of the valuation hierarchy. Short-term cash instruments consist principally of certificates of deposits.

Contingent Consideration

Contingent consideration relates to the earnout payment set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement governing the acquisition of Northeast Power Systems, Inc ("NEPSI") that provided that NEPSI could receive up to an additional 
1,000,000
 shares of common stock of the Company upon the achievement of certain specified revenue objectives over varying periods of up to 
four
 years following the NEPSI Acquisition Date which concluded in 
 September 
of 
2024.
 The Megatran Stock Purchase Agreement provided that the selling stockholders would be made whole as set forth in the agreement. We classified contingent consideration related to certain acquisitions within level 
3
 of the fair value hierarchy because the fair value is derived using significant unobservable inputs, which include revenue risk premium and revenue volatility. See Note 
13,
 "Contingent Consideration" for further discussion. As of 
 September 30, 2024, 
the Company had settled all outstanding contingent consideration.

 Contingent Consideration

NEPSI Contingent Consideration

On 
 October 1, 2020 (
the "NEPSI Acquisition Date"), the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "NEPSI Stock Purchase Agreement") with the selling stockholders named therein. Pursuant to the terms of the NEPSI Stock Purchase Agreement and concurrently with entering into such agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding (i) shares of capital stock of NEPSI, and (ii) membership interests of Northeast Power Realty, LLC, a New York limited liability company, which holds the real property that serves as NEPSI's headquarters (the "NEPSI Acquisition"). NEPSI is a U.S.-based global provider of medium-voltage metal-enclosed power capacitor banks and harmonic filter banks for use on electric power systems. NEPSI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and is operated by its Grid business segment. The purchase price was $
26.0
 million in cash and 
873,657
 restricted shares of common stock of the Company. As part of the transaction, the selling stockholders were entitled to receive up to an additional 
1,000,000
 shares of common stock of the Company upon the achievement of certain specified revenue objectives during varying periods of up to 
four
 years following closing of the NEPSI Acquisition. During the year ended 
 March 31, 2024, 
the Company issued 
399,999
 shares of common stock and cash in lieu of a fractional share of common stock, related to the achievement of specified revenue objectives in connection with the NEPSI Acquisition. One specified revenue objective, which would have earned the selling stockholders 
300,000
 shares of Company common stock, was 
not
 achieved. NEPSI recognized revenues in excess of $
120.0
 million during the 
four
 years after the NEPSI Acquisition Date. As a result, during the quarter ended 
 September 30, 2024, 
the Company issued 
300,000
 shares of common stock of the Company to the selling stockholders, following certification of the achievement of the specified earnout revenue objective. As of 
 September 30, 2024, 
the Company had settled all outstanding contingent consideration under the NEPSI Stock Purchase Agreement.

The Company evaluated the NEPSI Acquisition earnout payment set forth in the NEPSI Stock Purchase Agreement, which was expected to require settlement in the Company's common stock, and determined the contingent consideration qualified for liability classification and derivative treatment under ASC 
815,

Derivatives and Hedging
. As a result, for the periods in which the Company had outstanding contingent consideration, the fair value of the contingent consideration was remeasured and the resulting gain or loss was recognized in operating expenses until the share amount was fixed.

The following is a summary of the key assumptions used in a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the NEPSI Acquisition:

3.4
 million for the increase in the fair value of the contingent consideration in the year ended 
 March 31,

NWL Contingent Consideration

On 
 August 
1,

2024
,
 the Company entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement with the selling stockholders of NWL named therein. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement and concurrently with entering into such agreement, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Megatran for aggregate consideration in an amount equal to $
61.4
 million which consideration amount was subject to various adjustments set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. The value of the contingent consideration to make the sellers whole was determined to be de minimis at the time of the Acquisition. On 
 September 23, 2024, 
the Company paid $
3.3
 million to the selling stockholders, which was calculated based on the agreed upon formula set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. This amount is reflected as the change in fair value of this contingent consideration in the fiscal year ended 
 March 31, 2025. 
As of 
 September 30, 2024, 
there were 
no
 remaining obligations to the selling stockholders of NWL.

Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 
2017,
 taxpayers are required to capitalize and amortize expenses related for research and experimental as classified under Section 
174
 beginning in 
2022.
 Amortization recovery for such costs are 
five
 years for domestic expenditures and 
fifteen
 for foreign expenditures. As of 
 March 31, 2025
, the Company had approximately $
31.9
 million of research and experimental expenses that had been capitalized under Section 
174
 with a remaining basis of $
24.4
 million.

The Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred income tax assets in the U.S., Romania and Poland since it is more likely than 
not
 that its deferred tax assets will 
not
 be realizable. After consideration of all the available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company has determined tha
t a $
171.7

million valuation allowance at 
 March 31, 2025
 is necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than 
not
 be realized which is a
 $
5.4

million decrease from the $
177.1
 million valuation allowance as of 
 March 31, 
2024
.

At 
 March 31, 2025
, the Company had aggregate net operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately $
655.7
 million 
and $
185.6
 m
illion, respectively, which expire in the years ending 
 March 31, 
2026
 through 
2040.
 For U.S. federal tax purpose, approximately 
$
103.1

million of federal net operating losses have an indefinite carryforward period. Included in the U.S. net operating loss are 
$
3.5
 million of acquired losses from Power Quality Systems, Inc. and $
0.3
 million of acquired losses from Infinia Technology Corporation. Research and development and other tax credit carryforwards amounting to approximately $
10.6
 million and $
2.5
 million are availab
le to offset federal and state income taxes, respectively, and will expire in the years ending 
2026
 through 
2041.

As of 
 March 31, 2025
, AMSC Romania has aggregate net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
0.4
 million, which will begin to expire at 
 March 31, 2028 
and NWL Poland has aggregate net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
0.4
 million, which will begin to expire at 
 March 31, 2030.  

     Section

382
 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of

1986,
 as amended (the “IRC”), provides limits on the extent to which a corporation that has undergone an ownership change (as defined) can utilize any net operating loss ("NOL") and general business tax credit carryforwards it

 may 
have. The Company updated its study in fiscal

2024
 to determine whether Section

382
 could limit the use of its carryforwards in this manner. After completing this study, the Company has concluded that the limitation will

not
 have a material impact on its ability to utilize its NOL carryforwards.  If there were material ownership changes subsequent to the study, such changes could limit the Company's ability to utilize its NOL carryforwards.

The total amount of undistributed foreign earnings available to be repatriated at 
 March 31, 2025
 was
 $
3.1

million resulting in the recording of a 
$
0.4

million deferred tax liability for foreign withholding taxes.

The Company has 
not
 recorded a deferred tax asset for the temporary difference associated with the excess of the tax greater than the book basis in its Romanian and Poland subsidiaries as the future tax benefit is 
not
 expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.

Accounting for income taxes requires a 
two
-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The 
first
 step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if, based on the technical merits, it is more likely than 
not
 that the position will be sustained upon audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The 
second
 step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 
50%
 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but 
not
 limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. The Company did 
not
 identify any uncertain tax positions at 
 March 31, 2025
. The Company did 
not
 have any gross unrecognized tax benefits at 
 March 31, 2025
 or 
2024
.

There were 
no
 reversals of uncertain tax positions in the fiscal years ended 
 March 31, 2025
 and 
2024
.

The Company accounts for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of its provision for federal and state income taxes. Any unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would favorably affect its effective tax rate in any future period. The Company does 
not
 expect that the amounts of unrecognized benefits will change significantly within the next 
twelve
 months.

The Company conducts business globally and, as a result, its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Major tax jurisdictions include the U.S. and Austria. All U.S. income tax filings for fiscal years ended 
 March 
31,

1997
 through 
2024
 remain open and subject to examination.

All fiscal years from the fiscal year ended

 Leases 

Operating Leases

All significant lease arrangements are recognized at lease commencement. Operating lease right–of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement. The operating lease right-of-use asset includes any lease payments related to initial direct cost and prepayments and excludes any lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company enters into a variety of operating lease agreements through the normal course of its business, but primarily real estate leases to support its operations. The real estate lease agreements generally provide for fixed minimum rental payments and the payment of real estate taxes and insurance. Many of these real estate leases have 
one
 or more renewal options that allow the Company, at its discretion, to renew the lease for varying periods up to 
five
 years or to terminate the lease. Only renewal options or termination rights that the Company believed were likely to be exercised were included in the lease calculations.

The Company also enters into leases for vehicles, IT equipment and service agreements, and other leases related to its manufacturing operations that are also included in the right-of-use assets and lease liability accounts if they are for a term of longer than 
twelve
 months. However, many of these leases are either short-term in nature or immaterial. The Company has made the policy election to exclude short-term leases from the consolidated balance sheets.

 Stockholders’ Equity

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

As of 
 March 31, 2025
, the Company had 
two
 active stock plans: the Amended and Restated 
2007
 Director Stock Plan, as amended (the 
“2007
 Director Plan”) and the 
2022
 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (the 
"2022
 Plan"). On 
 August 2, 2024, 
the Company's stockholders approved the amendments to the 
2022
 Plan and amendments to the Company's 
2007
 Director Plan. The amendment to the 
2022
 Plan increased the total number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 
2022
 Plan from 
1,150,000
 shares to 
4,400,000
 shares of common stock. The amendment to the 
2007
 Director Plan increased the total number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 
2007
 Director Plan from 
430,000
 shares to 
580,000
 shares. 

The 
2022
 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options intended to qualify under Section 
422
 of the IRC of 
1986,
 as amended, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards. In the case of options, the exercise price is 
no
 less than the fair market value of the common stock, as determined by (or in a manner approved by) the Board of Directors, on the date of grant. The contractual life of options is generally 
10
 years. Options generally vest over a 
3
-
5
 year period while restricted stock generally vests over a 
3
 year period. The 
2022
 Plan replaced the Company’s 
2007
 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the 
“2007
 Plan”). 
No
 further awards are granted under the 
2007
 Plan following effectiveness of the 
2022
 Plan; however, the terms and conditions of the 
2007
 Plan continue to govern any outstanding awards granted thereunder.

The 
2007
 Director Plan provides for the grant of nonstatutory stock options and stock awards to members of the Board of Directors who are 
not
 also employees of the Company ("outside directors"). Under the terms of the 
2007
 Director Plan, each outside director is granted an option to purchase shares of common stock with an aggregate grant date value equal to $
40,000
 upon his or her initial election to the Board with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. These options vest in equal annual installments over a 
two
-year period. In addition, each outside director is granted an award of shares of common stock on the 
third
 business day following the last day of each fiscal year with an aggregate value equal to $
50,000
 using the closing price of the Company's common stock 
two
 business days following the last day of each fiscal year, subject to proration for any partial fiscal year of service.

As of 
 March 31, 2025
, the 
2022
 Plan had 
2,450,662
 shares available for future issuance, and the 
2007
 Director Plan had 
253,596
 shares available for future issuance. Additionally, any shares which are subject to awards previously granted under the 
2007
 Plan that are forfeited or lapse unexercised and which following the effectiveness of the 
2022
 Plan are 
not
 issued under the 
2007
 Plan will become available for issuance under the 
2022
 Plan.

 Commitments and Contingencies

Purchase Commitments

The Company periodically enters into non-cancelable purchase contracts in order to ensure the availability of materials to support production of its products. Purchase commitments represent enforceable and legally binding agreements with suppliers to purchase goods or services. The Company periodically assesses the need to provide for impairment on these purchase contracts and records a loss on purchase commitments when required.

82

Lease Commitments

During the years ended 
 March 31, 2025
 and 
2024
, all lease costs were recorded in selling, general and administrative expense.  See Note 
16,
 "Leases" for further details.  

Legal Contingencies

From time to time, the Company is involved in legal and administrative proceedings and claims of various types. The Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company reviews these estimates each accounting period as additional information is known and adjusts the loss provision when appropriate. If a matter is both probable to result in a liability and the amounts of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company estimates and discloses the possible loss or range of loss to the extent necessary to make the consolidated financial statements 
not
 misleading. If the loss is 
not
 probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is 
not
 recorded in its consolidated financial statements.

Other

The Company enters into long-term construction contracts with customers that require the Company to obtain performance bonds. The Company is required to deposit an amount equivalent to some or all the face amount of the performance bonds into an escrow account until the termination of the bond. When the performance conditions are met, amounts deposited as collateral for the performance bonds are returned to the Company. In addition, the Company has various contractual arrangements in which minimum quantities of goods or services have been committed to be purchased on an annual basis.

As of 
 March 31, 2025
, the Company had $
4.3
 million of restricted cash included in long-term assets and $
1.6
 million of restricted cash included in current assets. As of 
 March 31, 
2024
, the Company had $
1.3
 million of restricted cash included in long term assets and $
0.5
 million of restricted cash included in current assets. These amounts included in restricted cash primarily represent deposits to secure letters of credit for various supply contracts and long-term projects or collateral deposits. These deposits are held in interest bearing accounts.

19.
 Employee Benefit Plans

The Company has implemented a defined contribution plan (the “Plan”) under Section 
401
(k) of the IRC. Any contributions made by the Company to the Plan are discretionary. The Company has a stock match program under which the Company matched, in the form of Company common stock, 
100
% up to 
5
% of eligible contributions. The Company recorded expenses 
of $
1.2

million and $
0.6
 million in the fiscal years ended 
 March 31, 2025
 and 
2024
, respectively, and recorded corresponding charges to additional paid-in capital related to this program.

20.
 Business Segments 

The Company reports its financial results in 
two
 reportable business segments: Grid and Wind. In accordance with ASC 
280,

Segment Reporting
, the Company has identified 
two
 operating segments. The Company's operating segments reflect the way in which internally-reported financial information is used to make decisions and allocate resources.

Through the Company’s power grid offerings, the Grid business segment enables electric utilities, industrial facilities, and renewable energy project developers to connect, transmit and distribute smarter, cleaner and better power through its transmission planning services, power electronics, and superconductor-based systems. The sales process is enabled by transmission planning services that allow it to identify power grid congestion, poor power quality and other risks, which helps the Company determine how its solutions can improve network performance. These services often lead to sales of grid interconnection solutions for wind farms and solar power plants, power quality systems, and transmission and distribution cable systems. The Company also sells ship protection products to the U.S. Navy through its Grid business segment.

83

Through the Company’s wind power offerings, the Wind business segment enables manufacturers to field highly competitive wind turbines through its advanced power electronics and control system products, engineered designs, and support services. The Company supplies advanced power electronics and control systems, licenses its highly engineered wind turbine designs, and provides extensive customer support services to wind turbine manufacturers. The Company’s design portfolio includes a broad range of drive trains and power ratings of 
2
 megawatts ("MWs") and higher. The Company provides a broad range of power electronics and software-based control systems that are highly integrated and designed for optimized performance, efficiency, and grid compatibility.

AMSC’s Chief Executive Officer Daniel McGahn is the chief operating decision maker. The chief operating decision maker uses segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources (including employees, property, and financial or capital resources) for each segment predominantly in the annual budget and forecasting process. The chief operating decision maker considers budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis for segment operating income (loss) when making decisions about allocating capital and personnel to the segments. The chief operating decision maker also uses segment operating income or loss to assess the performance for each segment by comparing the results and return on assets of each segment with 
one
 another and in the compensation of certain employees.

The following tables (i) summarize total sales by segment and (ii) reconcile each segment's sales to their respective segment operating income, including segment operating expenses, for each of the years ended 
 March 31, 2025
 and

The accounting policies of the business segments are the same as those for the consolidated Company. The Company’s business segments have been determined in accordance with the Company’s internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. The Company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measures are segment revenues and segment operating loss. The disaggregated financial results of the segments reflect allocation of certain functional expense categories consistent with the basis and manner in which Company management internally disaggregates financial information for the purpose of assisting in making internal operating decisions.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2025. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2025, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:

(1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets;

(2) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and

(3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, an evaluation was conducted of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025, based on the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework
 (2013 Edition). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 31, 2025. Our evaluation excluded the acquisition of Megatran Industries, Inc. (referred to as the “NWL acquisition”), which was acquired on August 1, 2024. Our Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended March 31, 2025 included revenue of approximately $50.5 million and our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2025 included total assets of approximately $85.4 million attributable to the NWL acquisition. In accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year subsequent to the acquisition while integrating the acquired operations.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025 has been audited by RSM US LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of American Superconductor Corporation

Opinion on the Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited American Superconductor Corporation's (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control
—
Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control
—
Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated May 21, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion.

As described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Megatran Industries, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (Megatran) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025, because it was acquired by the Company in the second quarter of 2024 and has not yet been fully incorporated into the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting. We have also excluded Megatran from our audit of internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2025. Megatran is a wholly owned subsidiary whose total assets and revenues represent approximately 28% and 23%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended March 31, 2025.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
