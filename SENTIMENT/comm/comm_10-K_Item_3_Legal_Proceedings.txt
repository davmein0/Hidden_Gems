ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company is party to certain intellectual property claims and also periodically receives notices asserting that its products infringe on another party’s patents and other intellectual property rights. These claims and assertions, whether against the Company directly or against its customers, could require the Company to pay damages or royalties, stop offering the relevant products and/or cease other activities. The Company may also be called upon to indemnify certain customers for costs related to products sold to such customers. The outcome of these claims and notices is uncertain and a reasonable estimate of the loss from unfavorable outcomes in certain of these matters either cannot be determined or is estimated at the minimum amount of a range of estimates. The actual loss, through settlement or trial, could be material and may vary significantly from our estimates. From time to time, the Company may also be involved as a plaintiff involving intellectual property claims. Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized.

The Company is also either a plaintiff or a defendant in certain other pending legal matters in the normal course of business. Management believes none of these pending legal matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or financial condition upon final disposition.

In addition, the Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the use, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous materials. Compliance with current laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a materially adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared with the year ended December 31, 2023. This comparison should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” included in Part I, Item 1A or in other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022, see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2024.

OVERVIEW

We are a global provider of infrastructure solutions for communication, data center and entertainment networks. Our solutions for wired and wireless networks enable service providers, including cable, telephone and digital broadcast satellite operators and media programmers, to deliver media, voice, Internet Protocol (IP) data services and Wi-Fi to their subscribers and allow enterprises to experience constant wireless and wired connectivity across complex and varied networking environments. Our solutions are complemented by services including technical support, systems design and integration. We are a leader in digital video and IP television distribution systems, broadband access infrastructure platforms and equipment that delivers data and voice networks to homes. Our global leadership position is built upon innovative technology, broad solution offerings, high-quality and cost-effective customer solutions, and global manufacturing and distribution scale.

We completed the acquisition of certain assets of Casa Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Casa) on June 7, 2024 (the Casa Transaction). 
As part of the Casa Transaction, we acquired certain assets (the Casa Assets) and assumed certain specified liabilities (the Casa Liabilities) of Casa. The sale was conducted pursuant to the bid procedures (the Bid Procedures) established in the chapter 11 cases of Casa Systems, Inc. and certain affiliates in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the Bankruptcy Court). Pursuant to the Bid Procedures, we were designated as the successful bidder following an auction held on May 29, 2024. On June 5, 2024, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the sale of the Casa Assets to us pursuant to section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (subject to the terms thereof). The sale closed on June 7, 2024 and, at such time, we funded the purchase price of $45.1 million and settled certain assumed Casa Liabilities, with cash on hand. We are integrating this strategic acquisition into our Access Network Solutions (ANS) segment and expect the acquisition to strengthen our ANS segment’s position by enhancing its 
virtual cable modem termination systems and passive optical network 
product offerings, which will enable customers to migrate to distributed access architecture solutions at their own speed, and further grow our customer base.
 We recorded $1.4 million of transaction and integration costs for the year ended December 31, 2024 related to the Casa Transaction, and these costs were recognized in selling, general and administrative expense in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 3 in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Casa Transaction.

CommScope NEXT

Since 2021, we have been engaged in a transformation initiative referred to as CommScope NEXT, which is designed to drive shareholder value through three pillars: profitable growth, operational efficiency and portfolio optimization. We believe these efforts are critical to making us more competitive and allowing us to invest in growth, de-leverage our indebtedness and maximize stockholder and other stakeholder value in the future. In 2022, CommScope NEXT generated positive impacts on net sales, profitability and cash flow from our execution on pricing initiatives, capacity expansion and operational efficiencies. In 2023, we experienced headwinds related to a slow-down in spending by our customers as discussed further below, but we continued to execute under CommScope NEXT to improve our profitability and cash flows by continuing to drive operational efficiencies and focusing on portfolio optimization, all of which is enabling us to take advantage of the recovery in demand that we began to see in late 2024. To that end, we incurred $36.7 million, $25.1 million and $41.8 million of net restructuring costs and $63.4 million, $27.1 million and $35.1 million of transaction, transformation and integration costs during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily related to CommScope NEXT initiatives. We expect to continue to incur such costs in 2025 as we continue executing on CommScope NEXT initiatives, and the resulting charges and cash requirements could be material.

43

On January 31, 2025, we completed the previously announced sale of our Outdoor Wireless Networks (OWN) segment and the Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) business unit of our Networking, Intelligent Cellular & Security Solutions (NICS) segment to Amphenol Corporation (Amphenol), pursuant to the Purchase Agreement dated July 18, 2024, in exchange for approximately $2.1 billion in cash. In the third quarter of 2024, we determined the sale of our OWN segment and DAS business unit met the “held for sale” criteria and the “discontinued operations” criteria in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 360-10, 
Impairment and Disposal of Long–Lived Assets
, and ASC No. 205-20, 
Presentation of Financial Statements:

Discontinued Operations, 
due to its relative size and strategic rationale. For all periods presented, amounts in these consolidated financial statements have been recast to reflect the discontinuation of our OWN segment and DAS business unit in accordance with guidance. All discussions and results related to our NICS segment exclude the DAS business unit, since the DAS business unit was moved to held for sale in the third quarter of 2024.

On January 9, 2024, we completed the sale of our Home Networks (Home) segment and substantially all of the associated segment assets and liabilities (Home business) to Vantiva SA (Vantiva) pursuant to the Call Option Agreement entered into on October 2, 2023 and the Purchase Agreement dated as of December 7, 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we determined the sale of our Home business met the “held for sale” criteria and the “discontinued operations” criteria in accordance with accounting guidance. All prior period amounts have been recast to reflect the discontinuation of our Home business.

Our continuing operations results include general corporate costs that were previously allocated to the OWN segment, DAS business unit and Home segment. These indirect costs, reflected on the corporate and other line item within our segment information below, are classified as continuing operations, since they were not directly attributable to these discontinued operations. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, the corporate and other costs related to the Home segment have been reallocated to our remaining segments and partially offset by income from our transition services agreement with Vantiva. The corporate and other costs related to the OWN segment and DAS business will be reallocated to our remaining segments beginning in the first quarter of 2025.

Additionally, below we refer to certain supplementary Core financial measures, which reflect the results of the CCS, NICS excluding DAS, and ANS segments, in the aggregate, and exclude general corporate costs that were previously allocated to the OWN segment, DAS business unit and Home segment, since these costs were not directly attributable to the discontinued operations. The Core results represent the business results as currently managed and reported by the Company. Future results and the composition of any business divested in the future may vary and differ materially from the presentation of the Core financial measures. See the “Segment Results” section below for the aggregation of our Core financial measures.

Unless otherwise noted, the following discussions relate solely to our continuing operations. As a result, we are reporting financial performance based on the following remaining three operating segments, which excludes the OWN segment, DAS business unit in NICS and Home business: Connectivity and Cable Solutions (CCS), NICS and ANS. For further discussion of the discontinued operations related to our OWN segment, DAS business unit and Home business, see Note 4 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As of January 1, 2024, we shifted certain product lines from our CCS segment to our ANS segment to better align with how the businesses are managed. All prior period amounts have been recast to reflect these operating segment changes.

Impacts of Current Economic Conditions

In 2023, macroeconomic factors such as higher interest rates, inflation and concerns about a global economic slow-down softened demand for our products, with certain customers reducing purchases as they right-sized their inventories and others pausing capital spending. This industry recession has continued to negatively impact our net sales in all markets except data centers, which saw increased investment during 2024. We are beginning to see a recovery in demand in certain businesses and expect to see additional recovery in demand in 2025.

In 2023, we also began implementing additional cost savings initiatives to improve profitability, and we continued to implement further initiatives during 2024. These initiatives should enable us to take advantage of the expected recovery in demand in 2025. If this expected recovery does not occur in 2025, our outlook will be materially impacted.

For more discussion on risks related to our customers, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Net sales in 2024 decreased $359.4 million, or 7.9%, compared to the prior year primarily driven by decreased sales volumes as certain customers reduced purchases as they right-size their inventories and others paused capital spending and lower pricing. The decrease was driven by lower net sales in the ANS segment of $260.5 million and the NICS segment of $220.7 million, partially offset by higher net sales of $121.8 million in the CCS segment. For further details by segment, see the discussion of Segment Results below.

From a regional perspective in 2024, net sales decreased in the U.S. by $248.1 million, the Caribbean and Latin American (CALA) region by $78.0 million and the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region by $43.1 million, and increased in Canada by $7.5 million and the Asia Pacific (APAC) region by $2.3 million. Net sales to customers located outside of the U.S. comprised 34.3% of total net sales for 2024 compared to 34.1% for 2023. Foreign exchange rate changes did not have a material impact on our net sales during 2024.

Gross profit (net sales less cost of sales)

Gross profit decreased in 2024 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower net sales volumes, lower pricing and higher input costs, partially offset by favorable product mix.

Transition service agreement income

Transition service agreement (TSA) income is related to the TSA we entered into with Vantiva in conjunction with the closing of the transaction to divest of the Home business in January 2024. Under the TSA agreement, we provided (and in some instances received) certain post-closing support on a transitional basis. As of the end of 2024, the services for Vantiva have ceased.

Selling, general and administrative expense

For 2024, selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased by $27.7 million compared to 2023, primarily due to cost saving initiatives and lower bad debt expense of $11.6 million, partially offset by higher transaction, transformation, and integration costs of $36.2 million and higher variable incentive compensation expense of $14.3 million. We expect to continue to incur transaction, transformation and integration costs in 2025 and the resulting charges and cash requirements could be material.

Research and development expense

Research and development (R&D) expense for 2024 decreased by $66.9 million compared to the prior year primarily due to lower spending within all segments. R&D activities generally involve ensuring that our products are capable of meeting the evolving technological needs of our customers, bringing new products to market and modifying existing products to better serve our customers.

Amortization of purchased intangible assets

The amortization of purchased intangible assets was lower in 2024 compared to the prior year because certain of our intangible assets became fully amortized.

46

Restructuring costs, net

The net restructuring costs recorded in 2024 were primarily related to CommScope NEXT. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our net restructuring costs were $36.7 million and we paid $28.9 million to settle restructuring liabilities. We expect to make cash payments of $4.0 million in 2025 to settle CommScope NEXT restructuring actions. Additional restructuring actions related to CommScope NEXT are expected to be identified, and the resulting charges and cash requirements could be material.

Asset impairments

We did not record any asset impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2024. We recorded goodwill impairment charges of $472.3 million and $99.1 million in 2023 related to our ANS and Building Data Center Connectivity (BDCC) reporting units, respectively. The ANS reporting unit is the same as our ANS segment and the BDCC reporting unit is in our CCS segment.

Foreign currency gain (loss)

Foreign currency gain (loss) includes the net foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the settlement of receivables and payables, foreign currency contracts and short-term intercompany advances in a currency other than the subsidiary’s functional currency. The change in foreign currency gain (loss) in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by certain unhedged currencies.

Other income, net

The change in other income, net in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by a gain of $74.3 million on the early extinguishment of debt related to our debt repurchases in 2023 and $6.4 million of debt issuance costs related to the debt refinancing transactions in December 2024. See Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the 2024 debt refinancing transactions.

Interest expense and Interest income

Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased $11.1 million compared to the prior year primarily due to the 
write-off of $16.2 million of existing debt issuance costs and original issuance discount associated with the redemption of our 
senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2025 (2025 Notes)
 and the refinancing 
of our existing 
senior secured term loan due 2026 (2026 Term Loan) 
as further discussed in Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The increase was partially offset by favorable impacts from lower long-term balances as a result of the debt repurchases in 2023. Our weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings, including the impact of the interest rate swap contracts and the amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount, was 8.09% at December 31, 2024 and 7.22% at December 31, 2023. Our interest expense and payments on our variable rate debt could increase if the Federal Reserve increases interest rates in 2025.

47

Income tax expense

For 2024, we recognized income tax expense of $51.7

million on a pretax loss of $409.3 million. Our tax expense on a pretax loss was less than the statutory rate of 21.0% in 2024 primarily due to the unfavorable impact related to an additional net $135.2 million of valuation allowance recorded during the year. Our tax expense was also impacted unfavorably by the U.S. anti-deferral provisions and non-creditable withholding taxes, partially offset by tax benefits related to federal tax credits. See Note 14 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more discussion of our income tax expense.

For 2023, we recognized income tax expense of $97.4

million on a pretax loss of $998.4 million. Our tax expense was more than the statutory rate of 21.0% in 2023 primarily due to the unfavorable impact related to a net $165.4 million of valuation allowance recorded during the year and a goodwill impairment charge of $571.4 million, for which minimal tax benefits were recorded. Our tax expense was also impacted by the unfavorable impacts of U.S. anti-deferral provisions and non-creditable withholding taxes, partially offset by tax benefits related to federal tax credits.

Core financial measures reflect the results of the CCS, NICS and ANS segments, in the aggregate, and exclude general corporate costs that were previously allocated to the OWN segment, DAS business unit and Home segment, since these costs were not directly attributable to these discontinued operations.

(2)
The corporate and other line item above reflects general corporate costs that were previously allocated to the OWN segment, DAS business unit and Home segment. These indirect expenses have been classified as continuing operations, since the costs were not directly attributable to these discontinued operations. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, the corporate and other costs related to the Home segment have been reallocated to our remaining segments and partially offset by income from the Vantiva TSA. The corporate and other costs related to the OWN segment and DAS business unit will be reallocated to our remaining segments beginning in the first quarter of 2025.

Connectivity and Cable Solutions Segment

Net sales for the CCS segment increased in 2024 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher sales volumes in the Enterprise business, partially offset by lower outdoor network solutions sales volumes in the first half of the year as certain customers paused spending as they right-sized their inventory levels. From a regional perspective in 2024, net sales increased in the U.S. by $115.5 million, the EMEA region by $36.7 million, the APAC region by $13.5 million and Canada by $6.3 million, but decreased in the CALA region by $50.2 million compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange rate changes did not have a material impact on CCS segment net sales during 2024.

49

For 2024, CCS segment operating income and adjusted EBITDA increased compared to the prior year primarily due to higher sales volumes, favorable product mix and lower input costs, partially offset by higher SG&A costs. The increases in SG&A costs were primarily due to higher variable incentive compensation expense, partially offset by lower bad debt expense and cost savings initiatives. In 2024, compared to the prior year, CCS segment operating income was favorably impacted by a reduction to impairment charges resulting from the prior year goodwill impairment charge of $99.1 million, a reduction of $12.6 million in restructuring costs and a reduction of $3.2 million in amortization expense, partially offset by an increase of $13.9 million in transaction, transformation and integration costs. Goodwill impairment charges, restructuring costs, amortization expense and transaction, transformation and integration costs are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA. See “Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA” within this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.

Networking, Intelligent Cellular and Security Solutions Segment

Net sales for the NICS segment decreased in 2024 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower sales volumes of our Ruckus products driven by lower demand and channel inventory digestion. From a regional perspective in 2024, net sales decreased in the U.S. by $140.2 million, the EMEA region by $47.8 million, the APAC region by $27.0 million and Canada by $8.7 million, but increased in the CALA region by $3.0 million compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange rate changes did not have a material impact on NICS segment net sales during 2024.

For 2024, NICS segment operating income and adjusted EBITDA decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to lower sales volumes and E&O reserves recorded for excess inventory, partially offset by lower R&D costs and favorable product mix. In 2024, compared to the prior year, NICS segment operating income was unfavorably impacted by an increase of $3.2 million in transaction, transformation and integrations costs and a reduction of $3.5 million in gains related to the settlement of an intellectual property litigation claim received in the prior year. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a reduction of $4.6 million in restructuring costs. Transaction, transformation and integration costs, intellectual property litigation costs and restructuring costs are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA. See “Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA” within this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.

Access Network Solutions Segment

Net sales for our ANS segment decreased in 2024 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower sales volume as certain customers have paused spending as they right-size their inventory levels. From a regional perspective in 2024, net sales decreased in the U.S. by $223.4 million, the EMEA region by $32.0 million and the CALA region by $30.8 million, but increased in the APAC region by $15.8 million and Canada by $9.9 million compared to the prior year. Foreign exchange rate changes did not have a material impact on ANS segment net sales during 2024.

Excluding the prior year goodwill impairment charge of $472.3 million from operating loss, for 2024, ANS segment operating loss and adjusted EBITDA were negatively impacted by lower sales volumes and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by benefits from lower SG&A, input and R&D costs, compared to the prior year. The reductions in SG&A costs were primarily due to cost savings initiatives. ANS segment operating loss was favorably impacted by a reduction of $63.1 million in amortization expense, partially offset by an increase of $37.8 million in restructuring costs. Also see “Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA” within this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, below.

Working capital is net of assets and liabilities held for sale and consists of current assets of $2,127.0 million less current liabilities of $984.4 million as of December 31, 2024 and current assets of $2,118.0 million less current liabilities of $925.6 million as of December 31, 2023.

(3)
Total capitalization includes long-term debt, including the current portion, Series A convertible preferred stock (Convertible Preferred Stock) and stockholders’ deficit.

Our principal sources of liquidity on a short-term basis are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows provided by operations and availability under our credit facilities. On a long-term basis, our potential sources of liquidity also include raising capital through the issuance of additional equity and/or debt.

The primary uses of liquidity include debt service requirements, voluntary debt repayments, redemptions or purchases on the open market, working capital requirements, capital expenditures, business separation transaction costs, transformation costs, restructuring costs, dividends related to the Convertible Preferred Stock if we elect to pay such dividends in cash, litigation settlements, income tax payments and other contractual obligations. As of December 31, 2024, we have repaid the $1.27 billion previously outstanding on our 2025 Notes.

We currently believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and cash flows from operations, combined with availability under our Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated future cash needs. However, we may be required to obtain additional financing in the future to address our liquidity needs, and, subject to market conditions, we may from time to time seek to amend, refinance, restructure, exchange or repurchase our outstanding indebtedness and/or raise additional equity or other financing. Any debt we incur in the future may have terms (including cash interest rate, financial covenants and covenants limiting our operating flexibility or ability to obtain additional financings) that are not favorable to us, and any such additional equity financing may dilute the economic and/or voting interests of our existing stockholders, may be preferred in right of payment to our outstanding common stock or confer other privileges to the holders and may contain financial or operational covenants that restrict our operating flexibility or ability to obtain additional financings. Furthermore, our failure to obtain any necessary financing, amendment, refinancing, restructuring, exchange or repurchases could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity.

We may experience volatility in cash flows between periods due to, among other reasons, variability in the timing of vendor payments and customer receipts. We may, from time to time, seek to obtain alternative sources of financing, by borrowing additional amounts under our Revolving Credit Facility, issuing debt or equity securities or incurring other indebtedness, if market conditions are favorable, utilizing trade credit, selling assets (including businesses or business lines) or securitizing receivables to meet future cash needs or to reduce our borrowing costs. Any issuance of equity or debt may be for cash or in exchange for our outstanding securities or indebtedness, or a combination thereof.

2
 In connection with the repayment of all outstanding amounts under our Revolving Credit Facility on January 31, 2025, the committed amount thereunder was reduced to $750.0 million, subject to borrowing base limitations.

51

Certain of our outstanding debt securities and debt under our credit facilities are currently trading at discounts to their respective principal amounts. In order to reduce future cash interest payments, as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption, we may, from time to time, purchase such debt for cash, in exchange for common or preferred stock or debt, or for a combination thereof, in each case in open-market purchases and/or privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or exchange offers and upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine. Any such transactions will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general market conditions and applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not we engage in any such transactions will be determined at our discretion. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material.

Our interest payments on long-term debt are expected to total $2,906.8 million over the duration of the debt, with $613.5 million due in 2025 (assuming interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2024 on our variable rate debt). In 2024, the interest payments on our variable rate debt were higher than the prior year as a result of the Federal Reserve maintaining higher interest rates throughout most of the year. While the Federal Reserve ended 2024 with several rate cuts, our interest payments on our variable debt could increase if the Federal Reserve chooses to raise interest rates in future periods. For additional information regarding our long-term debt obligations, see Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and our discussion of our interest rate risk in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For information on our obligations related to our Convertible Preferred Stock, see Note 15 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In July 2023, we entered into a long-term supply contract with a third-party to secure the supply of certain raw materials. Under the terms of the contract, we will make advance payments through 2026 totaling $120.0 million (undiscounted) and based on meeting certain minimum purchase requirements through 2031, such advance payments will be credited and applied to future orders on a quarterly basis beginning in 2027 through 2031. We have committed to purchases of raw material under this agreement beginning in 2023 and growing to a level of approximately $137 million per year by 2026 and continuing through 2032.

We have $140.7 million in unrecognized tax benefits; however, the timing of the related tax payments is highly uncertain. We anticipate a reduction of up to $22.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months. See Note 14 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

Although there are no financial maintenance covenants under the terms of our senior notes, there is a limitation, among other limitations, on certain future borrowings based on an adjusted leverage ratio or a fixed charge coverage ratio. These ratios are based on financial measures similar to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA as presented in the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” section below, but also give pro forma effect to certain events, including acquisitions, synergies and savings from cost reduction initiatives such as facility closures and headcount reductions. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our non-GAAP pro forma adjusted EBITDA, as measured pursuant to the indentures governing our notes, was $717.6 million, which included annualized savings expected from cost reduction initiatives of $17.4 million so that the impact of cost reduction initiatives is fully reflected in the twelve-month period used in the calculation of the ratios. In addition to limitations under these indentures, our senior secured credit facilities contain customary negative covenants based on similar financial measures. We believe we are in compliance with the covenants under our indentures and senior secured credit facilities at December 31, 2024.

Cash and cash equivalents increased by $119.5 million during 2024 as described under the Cash Flow Overview section below. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 42% of our cash and cash equivalents were held outside the U.S.

Working capital, net of assets and liabilities held for sale and excluding cash and cash equivalents and the current portion of long-term debt, decreased during 2024 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower inventory driven by inventory reduction initiatives, higher accounts payable due to timing of payments and higher accrued expenses including a higher variable incentive compensation expense in 2024. These impacts were partially offset by higher accounts receivable due to timing of collections. During 2024, we sold accounts receivable under customer-sponsored supplier financing agreements. This had an impact of approximately $103 million on working capital, excluding cash and cash equivalents and the current portion of long-term debt, as of December 31, 2024. Under these agreements, we are able to sell accounts receivable to a bank, and we retain no interest in and have no servicing responsibilities for the accounts receivable sold. The net reduction in total capitalization during 2024 reflected the net loss for the year.

Cash Flow Overview

The cash flows related to discontinued operations have not been segregated. Accordingly, the following cash flow overview includes the results of continuing and discontinued operations. Cash and cash equivalents increased during 2024 primarily driven by cash generated by operating activities of $273.1 million, partially offset by net cash paid for the debt refinancing transaction of $57.1 million, amortization payments totaling $24.0 million related to the 2026 Term Loan, cash paid related to the Casa Transaction of $45.1 million and capital expenditures of $26.2 million. For additional discussion related to the debt refinancing transactions, see Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations were $0.7 million in 2024 compared to $5.2 million in the prior year. Cash generated by other investing activities in the current year included proceeds of $13.0 million on the sale of certain nonfinancial assets.

In 2024, we completed certain refinancing transactions including the issuance of
 $1,000 million in aggregate principal amount of 9.500% senior secured notes due 2031 and entry into the new senior secured term loan facility due December 2029 with an initial aggregate principal amount of $3,150.0 million. We used the net proceeds, together with cash on hand and $200.0 million of borrowings under our 
asset-based revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility)
, to refinance in full the Company’s existing 2026 Term Loan and redeem all of the approximately $1,274.6 million in outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Notes. In connection with the refinancing transactions, we paid approximately $59.4 million of original issuance discount and $33.1 million of debt issuance costs.

In 2024, we paid quarterly scheduled amortization payments totaling $24.0 million on the 2026 Term Loan prior to the refinancing.

As of December 31, 2024, we had $200.0 million of outstanding borrowings and the remaining availability was $449.3 million, reflecting a borrowing base subject to maximum capacity of $719.2 million reduced by $69.9 million of letters of credit issued under our Revolving Credit Facility.

In 2023, we repurchased $133.1 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.25% senior notes due 2027, $58.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.125% senior notes due 2028 and $25.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 2025 Notes, for total cash consideration paid of $142.6 million. We also paid four quarterly scheduled amortization payments totaling $32.0 million on our 2026 Term Loan during 2023. We did not borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility during 2023.

In 2024, we paid dividends of $65.2 million in additional shares due under the Convertible Preferred Stock. In 2023, we paid dividends of $61.8 million in additional shares due under the Convertible Preferred Stock. During 2024, employees surrendered shares of our common stock to satisfy their tax withholding requirements on vested restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs), which reduced cash flows by $1.9 million compared to $9.1 million in the prior year.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

We believe that presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures enhances an investor’s understanding of our financial performance. We further believe that these financial measures are useful in assessing our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business. We also use certain of these financial measures for business planning purposes and in measuring our performance relative to that of our competitors.

54

We believe these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that of our competitors. However, our use of the term “non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA” may vary from that of others in our industry. This financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to operating income (loss), net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP as measures of operating performance, operating cash flows or liquidity.

Although there are no financial maintenance covenants under the terms of our senior notes, there is a limitation, among other limitations, on certain future borrowings based on an adjusted leverage ratio or a fixed charge coverage ratio. These ratios are based on financial measures similar to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA as presented in this section, but also give pro forma effect to certain events, including acquisitions and savings from cost reduction initiatives such as facility closures and headcount reductions.

Reconciliation of Segment Adjusted EBITDA

Segment adjusted EBITDA is provided as a performance measure in Note 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Below we reconcile segment adjusted EBITDA for each segment individually to operating income (loss) for that segment to supplement the reconciliation of the total segment adjusted EBITDA to consolidated operating income (loss) in that footnote.

The corporate and other line item as presented in Note 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements represents general corporate costs that were previously allocated to the OWN segment, DAS business unit and Home segment. These indirect costs are classified as continuing operations since they were not directly attributable to these discontinued operations. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, the corporate and other costs related to the Home segment have been reallocated to the Company’s remaining segments and partially offset by income from the Vantiva TSA. The corporate and other costs related to the OWN segment and DAS business unit will be reallocated to our remaining segments beginning in the first quarter of 2025.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States (U.S.). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and their underlying assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other objective sources. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates, as appropriate, when changes in events or circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary.

The following critical accounting policies and estimates reflected in our financial statements are based on management’s knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management’s assumptions about future events. While we have generally not experienced significant deviations from our critical estimates in the past, it is reasonably possible that these estimates may ultimately differ materially from actual results. See Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of all our significant accounting policies.

Asset Impairment Reviews

Impairment Reviews of Goodwill

We test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually as of October 1 and on an interim basis when events occur or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value may no longer be recoverable. We compare the fair value of our reporting units with the carrying amount, including goodwill. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value.

57

We estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow (DCF) method or, as appropriate, a combination of the DCF method and a market approach known as the guideline public company method. Under the DCF method, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The significant assumptions in the DCF model primarily include, but are not limited to, forecasts of annual revenue growth rates, annual EBITDA margin and the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flow projections. When determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates, we consider historical performance trends, terminal growth rates, industry data, insight derived from customers, relevant changes in the reporting unit’s underlying business and other market trends that may affect the reporting unit. The discount rate is based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital as of the test date of market participants in the industry in which the reporting unit operates and is commensurate with the risk and uncertainty inherent in each reporting unit and in internally developed forecasts. Under the guideline public company method, we estimate the fair value based upon market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. The weighting of the fair value derived from the market approach may vary depending on the level of comparability of these publicly-traded companies to the reporting unit. When comparable public companies are not meaningful or not available, we may estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the DCF method.

Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves uncertainties because it requires management to develop numerous assumptions, including assumptions about the future growth and potential volatility in revenues and costs, capital expenditures, industry economic factors and future business strategy. Changes in projected revenue growth rates, projected EBITDA margins or estimated discount rates due to uncertain market conditions, loss of one or more key customers, changes in our strategy, changes in technology or other factors could negatively affect the fair value in one or more of our reporting units and result in a material impairment charge in the future.

To assess the reasonableness of the calculated fair values of our reporting units, we also compare the sum of the reporting units’ fair values to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units’ fair values over the market capitalization). If the implied control premium is not reasonable, we will reevaluate the fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting the discount rates and/or other assumptions.

2024 Interim and Annual Goodwill Analysis

Interim Test

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of the reporting unit may exceed its fair value. As of January 1, 2024, we assessed goodwill for impairment due to changes in the composition of certain reporting units and performed impairment testing immediately before and after the change once goodwill was reallocated and determined that no goodwill impairment existed. During the third quarter of 2024, we completed an impairment analysis for goodwill recorded within the NICS reporting unit, which is impacted by the divestiture of the DAS business. The quantitative assessment was used, and the Company determined that the fair value of the impacted reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and that no impairment existed immediately prior to or subsequent to allocating goodwill to the disposal group that includes our DAS business.

Annual Test

The annual test of goodwill impairment was performed for each of the reporting units with goodwill balances as of October 1, 2024. For the 2024 annual goodwill test, we determined the fair value of each reporting unit using a DCF model and a guideline public company approach, with 75% of the value determined using the DCF model and 25% of the value determined using the market approach. The range of discount rates used in our annual tests was 9.5% to 14.5% for 2024. We determined that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value and that no impairment existed.

Considering the low headroom going forward for the ANS reporting unit, there is a risk for future impairment in the event of further declines in general economic, market or business conditions or any significant unfavorable change in the forecasted cash flows, weighted average cost of capital or growth rates. If current and long-term projections for the ANS reporting unit is not realized or decrease materially, we may be required to recognize additional goodwill impairment charges, and these charges could be material to our results of operations.

58

The following table provides summary information regarding our reporting units with goodwill balances as of December 31, 2024 that have the lowest level of headroom. The table presents key assumptions used in our annual goodwill analysis, along with sensitivity analysis showing the effect of a change in certain key assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant, to the resulting fair value using an income approach.

Definite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets

Management reviews definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable. This analysis differs from our goodwill impairment analysis in that an intangible or other long-lived asset impairment is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows related to the assets being evaluated is less than the carrying value of the assets. If the forecasted net cash flows are less than the carrying value, then the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Other than certain assets impaired as a result of restructuring actions, we did not identify any impairments of definite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets in 2024. Changes in the estimates of forecasted net cash flows or changes in classification from held for use may result in future asset impairments that could be material to our results of operations.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue based on the satisfaction of distinct obligations to transfer goods and services to customers. Our revenue is generated primarily from product or equipment sales. We apply a five-step approach as defined in ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
, in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when a corresponding performance obligation is satisfied. Most contracts with customers are to provide distinct products or services within a single contract. However, if a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling price.

Product sales, to end-customers or distributors, represent over 90% of our revenue and are generally recognized at the point in time when products have been shipped, right to payment has been obtained and risk of loss has been transferred. Certain of our product performance obligations include proprietary operating system software, which typically is not considered separately identifiable. Therefore, sales of these products and the related software are considered one performance obligation.

License contracts include revenue recognized for the licensing of intellectual property, including software, sold separately without products. Functional intellectual property licenses do not meet the criteria for revenue to be recognized over time, and revenue is most commonly recognized upon delivery of the license/software to the customer.

Revenue is measured based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled based on customer contracts. Sales are adjusted for variable consideration amounts, including, but not limited to, estimated discounts, rebates, distributor price protection programs and returns. These estimates are determined based upon historical experience, contract terms, inventory levels in the distributor channel and other related factors. Adjustments to variable consideration estimates are recorded when circumstances indicate revisions may be necessary. Variable consideration is primarily related to sales to our distributors, system integrators and value-added resellers.

59

Contingencies and Litigation

We are a party to lawsuits, claims and proceedings incident to the operation of our business, including intellectual property infringement matters, those pertaining to labor and employment contracts and other matters, some of which allege substantial monetary damages. We assess these matters in order to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded. In making this determination, management may, depending on the nature of the matter, consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts. We expense legal fees associated with consultations and defense of lawsuits as incurred. We accrue for loss contingencies when losses become probable and are reasonably estimable. If the reasonable estimate of the loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate, the minimum amount of the range is recorded as a liability. Gain contingencies are recognized when they are realized.

Litigation outcomes are difficult to predict and are often resolved over long periods of time, making our estimates highly judgmental. Estimating probable losses requires the analysis of multiple possible outcomes that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties, such as future changes in facts and circumstances, differing interpretations of the law, assessments of the amount of damages and other factors beyond our control. There is the potential for a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount materially in excess of what we anticipated. Alternatively, if the judgments and estimates made by management are incorrect and a particular contingent loss does not occur, the contingent loss recorded would be reversed, thereby favorably impacting our results of operations.

Inventory Reserves

We maintain reserves to reduce the value of inventory based on the lower of cost or net realizable value, including allowances for excess and obsolete inventory. These reserves are based on management’s assumptions about and analysis of relevant factors including current levels of orders and backlog, forecasted demand, market conditions and new products or innovations that diminish the value of existing inventories. If actual market conditions deteriorate from those anticipated by management, additional allowances for excess and obsolete inventory could be required and may be material to our results of operations.

Tax Valuation Allowances and Liabilities for Unrecognized Tax Benefits

We establish an income tax valuation allowance when available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider the amounts, character, source and timing of expected future deductions or carryforwards as well as sources of taxable income and tax planning strategies that may enable utilization. We maintain an existing valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal. Changes in the amount or timing of expected future deductions or taxable income may have a material impact on the level of income tax valuation allowances. If we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future, an increase to an income tax valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made.

We also establish allowances related to value-added and similar recoverable taxes when it is considered probable that those assets are not recoverable. Changes in the probability of recovery or in the estimates of the amount recoverable are recognized in the period such determination is made and may be material to our gain (loss) from continuing operations.

We recognize income tax benefits related to particular tax positions only when it is considered more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained if examined on its technical merits by tax authorities. The amount of benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is evaluated to be greater than 50% likely to be realized. Considerable judgment is required to evaluate the technical merits of various positions and to evaluate the likely amount of benefit to be realized. Lapses in statutes of limitations, developments in tax laws, regulations and interpretations, and changes in assessments of the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions could have a material impact on the overall tax provision.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We may utilize derivative financial instruments, among other methods, to hedge some of these exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

Interest Rate Risk

The table below summarizes the expected interest and principal payments associated with our variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2024, primarily the 2029 Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility. The principal payments presented below are based on scheduled maturities and assume no borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. The interest payments presented below assume the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2024 (see Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The impact of a 1% increase in the interest rate index on projected future interest payments on the variable rate debt is also included in the table below.

We have utilized a hedging strategy to mitigate a portion of the exposure to changes in cash flows resulting from variable interest rates on the 2026 Term Loan. The hedging strategy extends to future borrowings or debt issued, to fix a portion of the future interest cash flows by designating qualifying receive-variable and pay-fixed interest rate swaps as a cash flow hedge for accounting and financial reporting purposes. In June 2023, and in conjunction with the amendment to its 2026 Term Loan due to reference rate reform, we settled and derecognized our cash flow hedges. A gain of $6.1 million remaining as a component of accumulated comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets continued to be reclassified to earnings through interest expense as the interest payments continued to be made on the 2026 Term Loan through December 17, 2024, at which time as a result of the refinancing transactions, the forecasted hedge transaction was no longer probable of occurring which resulted in a gain of $3.1 million being reclassified to earnings. We reenacted our hedging strategy in the third quarter of 2023, by entering into new interest rate swap derivatives with a total notional amount of $700 million which terminate on July 31, 2026. As a result of the refinancing transaction and changes in the terms of the 2029 Term Loan, we dedesignated our interest rate swaps as of December 17, 2024 and redesignated $700 million of the swaps as hedging instruments on the same day. As a result of the dedesignation and redesignation, there was no charge to gain (loss) related to amounts previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. We believe the likelihood that floating rate debt in the amount of $700 million will exist through the interest rate swaps' maturity in July 2026 and therefore, will continue to apply hedge accounting to the interest rate swaps. The total notional amount of the interest rate swap derivatives as of December 31, 2024 was $700.0 million with outstanding maturities up to nineteen months. As of December 31, 2024, the combined fair value of the interest rate swaps was an $2.4 million loss. The table above excludes the impact of these interest rate swap derivatives. See Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these contracts.

Foreign Currency Risk

Approximately 34% and 34% of net sales for 2024 and 2023, respectively, were to customers located outside the U.S. Significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our international sales levels and the related collection of amounts due. In addition, a significant decline in the value of currencies used in certain regions of the world as compared to the U.S. dollar could adversely affect product sales in those regions because our products may become more expensive for those customers to pay for in their local currency. Conversely, significant increases in the value of foreign currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar could adversely affect profitability as certain product costs increase relative to a U.S. dollar-denominated sales price. The foreign currencies to which we have the greatest exposure include the Chinese yuan, euro, British pound sterling, Mexican peso, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Brazilian real, South African rand, Indian rupee and Czech koruna. Local manufacturing provides a partial natural hedge and we continue to evaluate additional alternatives to help us reasonably manage the market risk related to foreign currency exposures.

We use derivative instruments such as forward exchange contracts to manage the risk of fluctuations in the value of certain foreign currencies. As of December 31, 2024, we had foreign exchange contracts with a net unrealized loss of $3.4 million, with maturities of up to four months and aggregate notional value of $123.6 million (based on exchange rates as of December 31, 2024). These contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and are marked to market each period through earnings and, as such, there were no unrecognized gains or losses as of December 31, 2024 or 2023. Our derivative instruments are not leveraged and are not held for trading or speculation. See Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these contracts. We continuously evaluate the amount and type of derivative instruments utilized to manage the market risk related to foreign currency exposures.

62

Commodity Price Risk

Materials account for a large portion of our cost of sales. These materials, such as aluminum, copper, steel, bimetals, optical fiber, plastics and other polymers, capacitors, memory devices and silicon chips, are subject to changes in market price as they are influenced by commodity markets and supply and demand levels, among other factors. Management attempts to mitigate these risks through effective requirements planning and by working closely with key suppliers to obtain the best possible pricing and delivery terms. We may also enter into agreements with certain suppliers to guarantee our access to certain key components.

As of December 31, 2024, we had no forward purchase commitments outstanding under take-or-pay contracts. We continuously evaluate the amount and type of derivative instruments utilized to manage commodity price risk.

In July 2023, the Company entered into a long-term supply contract with a third-party to secure the supply of certain raw materials. Under the terms of the contract, the Company will make advance payments through 2026 totaling $120.0 million (undiscounted) and based on meeting certain minimum purchase requirements through 2031, such advance payments will be credited and applied to future orders on a quarterly basis beginning in 2027 through 2031. Advance payments of $60.0 million and $30.0 million are recorded as other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company has committed to growing purchases of raw materials under this agreement to a level of approximately $137 million per year by 2026 and continuing through 2032.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of CommScope Holding Company, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CommScope Holding Company, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 25, 2
025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Valuation of Goodwill

Description of the Matter

As more fully described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2024, the Company’s goodwill was $2,867.3 million, of which $266.1 million relates to the Access Network Solutions (ANS) reporting unit. The Company’s goodwill is initially assigned to its reporting units as of the acquisition date.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2024 using both a discounted cash flow model and a guideline public company approach. As a result of the annual goodwill impairment test, no impairment charge was measured, as the estimated fair value of the ANS reporting unit was greater than the carrying value.
Auditing management’s goodwill impairment test was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value of the ANS reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to changes in significant assumptions, such as the estimated discount rate, projected revenue growth rate and projected EBITDA margin percentage, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions.

65

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We evaluated the Company’s assessment of the impairment of goodwill for the ANS reporting unit. We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the annual goodwill impairment test for this reporting unit, including controls over management’s development and review of the significant assumptions discussed above.

To test the estimated fair value of the ANS reporting unit, we performed audit procedures with the assistance of our valuation specialists that included, among others, assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We evaluated the Company’s estimated discount rate methodology and developed independent ranges of reasonable discount rates. We compared the significant assumptions of projected revenue growth rates and projected EBITDA margin percentages used by management to current industry and economic trends, changes to the Company’s business model, customer base or product mix and other relevant factors. We also evaluated the reasonableness of the guideline public companies used to develop the fair value estimate of the ANS reporting unit. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting unit that would result from changes in the assumptions. We also evaluated the related goodwill disclosures included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

Incomes Taxes - Valuation Allowance

Description of the Matter

As more fully described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, at December 31, 2024, the Company recognized deferred tax assets related to deductible temporary differences and carryforwards of $794.5 million, net of valuation allowances of $470.5 million. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of all available evidence, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Auditing management’s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required in determining whether sufficient projected future taxable income supports the realization of the Company’s existing deferred tax assets before expiration.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We evaluated the Company’s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets, with the assistance of our income tax professionals. We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the realizability of deferred tax assets, including controls over management’s development and review of the projected future taxable income.

To test the realizability of deferred tax assets, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating whether the sources of management’s projected future taxable income would be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets under the relevant tax laws. We evaluated the significant assumptions used by the Company to develop the projected future taxable income and tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. We also evaluated the related income tax disclosures included in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of CommScope Holding Company, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited CommScope Holding Company, Inc.’s

internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, CommScope Holding Company, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 25, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

CommScope Holding Company, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(In millions, unless otherwise noted)

1. 
   BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS
CommScope Holding Company, Inc., along with its direct and indirect subsidiaries (CommScope or the Company), is a global provider of infrastructure solutions for communication, data center and entertainment networks. The Company’s solutions for wired and wireless networks enable service providers including cable, telephone and digital broadcast satellite operators and media programmers, to deliver media, voice, Internet Protocol (IP) data services and Wi-Fi to their subscribers and allow enterprises to experience constant wireless and wired connectivity across complex and varied networking environments. The Company’s solutions are complemented by services including technical support, systems design and integration. CommScope is a leader in digital video and IP television (IPTV) distribution systems, broadband access infrastructure platforms and equipment that delivers data and voice networks to homes. CommScope’s global leadership position is built upon innovative technology, broad solution offerings, high-quality and cost-effective customer solutions, and global manufacturing and distribution scale.
On January 31, 2025, the Company completed the previously announced sale of the Outdoor Wireless Networks (OWN) segment and the Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) business unit of the Networking, Intelligent Cellular & Security Solutions (NICS) segment to Amphenol Corporation (Amphenol), pursuant to the Purchase Agreement dated July 18, 2024, in exchange for approximately $
2.1
 billion in cash.
 In the third quarter of 2024, the Company determined the sale of the OWN segment and DAS business unit met the “held for sale” criteria and the “discontinued operations” criteria in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 360-10, 
Impairment and Disposal of Long–Lived Assets
, and ASC No. 205-20, 
Presentation of Financial Statements:

Discontinued Operations, 
due to its relative size and strategic rationale. For all periods presented, amounts in these consolidated financial statements have been recast to reflect the discontinuation of the OWN segment and DAS business unit in accordance with this guidance. All discussions and results related to the NICS segment exclude the DAS business unit, since the DAS business unit was moved to held for sale in the third quarter of 2024.
The Company completed the acquisition of certain assets of Casa Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Casa) on June 7, 2024 (the Casa Transaction). 
As part of the Casa Transaction, the Company acquired certain assets (the Casa Assets) and assumed certain specified liabilities (the Casa Liabilities) of Casa. The sale was conducted pursuant to the bid procedures (the Bid Procedures) established in the chapter 11 cases of Casa Systems, Inc. and certain affiliates in the United States (U.S.) Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the Bankruptcy Court). Pursuant to the Bid Procedures, the Company was designated as the successful bidder following an auction held on May 29, 2024. On June 5, 2024, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the sale of the Casa Assets to the Company pursuant to Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (subject to the terms thereof). The sale closed on June 7, 2024 and, at such time, the Company funded the purchase price of $
45.1
 million and settled certain assumed Casa Liabilities, with cash on hand. The Company is integrating this strategic acquisition into its Access Network Solutions (ANS) segment and expects the acquisition to strengthen its ANS segment’s position by enhancing its 
virtual cable modem termination systems (

CMTS) and passive optical network (
PON) product offerings, which will enable customers to migrate to distributed access architecture (DAA) solutions at their own speed, and further grow its customer base. 
See Note 3 for additional discussion of the Casa Transaction.
On January 9, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its Home Networks (Home) segment and substantially all of the associated segment assets and liabilities (Home business) to Vantiva SA (Vantiva) pursuant to the Call Option Agreement entered into on October 2, 2023 and Purchase Agreement dated as of December 7, 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company determined the sale of the Home business met the “held for sale” criteria and the “discontinued operations” criteria in accordance with accounting guidance. All prior period amounts in these consolidated financial statements have been recast to reflect the discontinuation of the Home business.

The discussions in these consolidated financial statements relate solely to the Company’s continuing operations, unless otherwise noted. As a result, the Company is reporting financial performance based on the following remaining three operating segments, which excludes the OWN segment, DAS business unit of the NICS segment and Home business: Connectivity and Cable Solutions (CCS), NICS and ANS. See Note 4 for further discussion of the discontinued operations related to the OWN segment, DAS business unit and Home business.
As of January 1, 2024, management shifted certain product lines from the Company’s CCS segment to its ANS segment to better align with how the businesses are managed. All prior period amounts in these consolidated financial statements have been recast to reflect these operating segment changes.

2.    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include CommScope Holding Company, Inc., along with its direct and indirect subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Revision of Previously Issued Financial Statements
In 2024, the Company identified errors within the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 (specifically in the quarter ended December 31, 2023). The errors related to the treatment of foreign currency translation associated with the loss on held for sale classification included in loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, and changes in uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances impacting other noncurrent liabilities and income tax expense. The Company assessed the materiality of these errors and subsequent correction on its current and prior period consolidated financial statements on a qualitative and quantitative basis in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 99, Materiality, and SAB No. 108 on Quantifying Financial Statement Errors, codified in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. Based on this assessment, although the Company concluded that the previously issued financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, were not materially misstated, the Company corrected the immaterial errors for the previously reported year ended December 31, 2023 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In connection with these adjustments, the Company also corrected certain other immaterial adjustments affecting both continuing and discontinued operations, as noted below. Amounts adjusted to reflect the correction of these errors are labeled “As Adjusted” within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The impact of the revisions for the year ended December 31, 2023 are disclosed below. The Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Deficit for the year ended December 31, 2023 was only impacted by the change to net income (loss) and is not included in the tables below.
The impact of the first quarter revisions on the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2024, six months ended June 30, 2024 and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were also considered immaterial and are presented below.

There was no impact to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations or Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the three months ended June 30, 2024 or September 30, 2024.

The following tables are in millions, except per share amounts.

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of the Financial Statements

The preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and their underlying assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other objective sources. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates, as appropriate, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary. Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Company’s financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts; reserves for sales returns, discounts, allowances, rebates and distributor price protection programs; inventory excess and obsolescence reserves; contingent liabilities; tax valuation allowances; liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits; impairment reviews for investments, property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets; and pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities. Although these estimates are based on management’s knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management’s assumptions about future events, it is at least reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents represent deposits in banks and cash invested temporarily in various instruments that are highly liquid and have a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Trade accounts receivable and contract assets for unbilled receivables are stated at the amount owed by the customer, net of allowances for estimated doubtful accounts, discounts, returns and rebates. The Company measures the allowance for doubtful accounts using an expected credit loss model, which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade accounts receivable and contract assets. To measure the expected credit losses, trade accounts receivable and contract assets are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due based on the contractual terms of the receivable. Contract assets relate to unbilled work in progress and have substantially the same risk characteristics as trade accounts receivable for the same types of contracts. Therefore, the Company has concluded that the expected loss rates for trade accounts receivable are a reasonable approximation of the loss rates for the contract assets.

In calculating an allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company uses its historical experience, external indicators and forward-looking information to calculate expected credit losses using an aging method. The Company assesses impairment of trade accounts receivable on a collective basis, as they possess shared credit risk characteristics which have been grouped based on the days past due.

The expected loss rates are based on the payment profiles of sales over the preceding thirty-six months and the corresponding historical credit losses experienced within this period. The historical loss rates are adjusted to reflect current and forward-looking information on macroeconomic factors affecting the ability of the customers to settle their trade accounts receivable. Accounts are written off against the allowance account when they are determined to be no longer collectible.

CommScope Holding Company, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
(In millions, unless otherwise noted)

The Company sells certain of its accounts receivable under customer-sponsored supplier financing agreements. Under these agreements, the Company is able to sell certain accounts receivable to a bank at a discount. The Company sold approximately $
330
 million and $
183
 million of trade accounts receivable under these programs during the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively, and the cost of factoring such receivables was not material. The Company derecognizes the accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets once sold to the bank, as it retains no interest in and has no servicing responsibilities for them once they have been sold. The cash received from the bank is classified within the operating activities section in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventory cost is determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Costs such as idle facility expense, excessive scrap and re-handling costs are expensed as incurred. The Company maintains reserves to reduce the value of inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value, including reserves for excess and obsolete inventory.
Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations
The Company reports the results of operations of a business as discontinued operations if a disposal represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results when the business is sold, in accordance with the criteria of ASC Topic 205-20, 
Presentation of Financial Statements—Discontinued Operations
, and classified as held for sale, in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10, 
Impairment and Disposal of Long Lived Assets
. For assets (disposal group) held for sale, the disposal group as a whole is measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell after adjusting the individual assets of the disposal group, if necessary. The results of discontinued operations are reported in loss from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations for the current and prior periods and include any gain or loss recognized on classification as held for sale, or adjustment of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. If the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value less cost to sell, a loss is recognized. Assets and liabilities related to a business classified as held for sale are segregated in the current and prior periods on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If a business is classified as held for sale after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued, the business continues to be classified as held and used in those financial statements when issued or when available to be issued.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
CommScope is exposed to risks resulting from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. CommScope’s risk management strategy includes the use of derivative financial instruments whenever management determines their use to be reasonable and practical. This strategy does not permit the use of derivative financial instruments for trading or speculation.
The Company periodically uses forward contracts to hedge a portion of its balance sheet foreign exchange re-measurement risk and to hedge certain planned foreign currency expenditures. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from these contracts are recognized in other income, net and partially offset corresponding foreign exchange gains and losses on the balances and expenditures being hedged. These instruments are not designated as hedges for hedge accounting purposes and are marked to market each period through earnings.
The Company also utilizes a hedging strategy to mitigate the interest rate risk from its variable rate debt, associated with its borrowings or debt issued, to fix a portion of the future interest cash flows by designating qualifying receive-variable and pay-fixed interest rate swaps as a cash flow hedge for accounting and financial reporting purposes. Hedge effectiveness is assessed each quarter, and for hedges that meet the effectiveness requirements, changes in fair value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and are reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s variable rate debt.
The Company has elected and documented the use of the normal purchases and sales exception for normal purchase and sales contracts that meet the definition of a derivative financial instrument. See Note 10 for further disclosure related to the derivative instruments and hedging activities.

Leases
The Company determines if a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception. Right of use assets related to operating type leases are reported in other noncurrent assets and the present value of remaining lease obligations is reported in accrued and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the periods presented, CommScope does not have any financing type leases.
Operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The majority of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate; therefore, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rates applicable to the economic environment and the duration of the lease, based on the information available at commencement date, in determining the present value of future payments. The right of use asset for operating leases is measured using the lease liability adjusted for the impact of lease payments made prior to commencement, lease incentives received, initial direct costs incurred and any asset impairments. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company remeasures and reallocates the consideration in a lease when there is a modification of the lease that is not accounted for as a separate contract. The lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in the lease term or a change in the assessment of whether the Company will exercise a lease option. The Company assesses right of use assets for impairment in accordance with its long-lived asset impairment policy.
The Company accounts for lease agreements with contractually required lease and non-lease components on a combined basis. Lease payments made for cancellable leases, variable amounts that are not based on an observable index and lease agreements with an original duration of less than twelve months are recorded directly to lease expense.
Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Upon application of acquisition accounting, property, plant and equipment are measured at estimated fair value as of the acquisition date to establish a new historical cost basis. Provisions for depreciation are based on estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Useful lives generally range from 
10
 to 
35 years
 for buildings and improvements and 
3
 to 
10 years
 for machinery and equipment. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Assets that management intends to dispose of and that meet “held for sale” criteria are carried at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill is assigned to reporting units based on the difference between the purchase price as allocated to the reporting units and the estimated fair value of the identified net assets acquired as allocated to the reporting units. Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition less accumulated amortization and any impairment charges. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which approximates the pattern that the economic benefits are realized by the Company.
Asset Impairments

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of the reporting unit may exceed its fair value. Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets with finite lives and right of use assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, based on the undiscounted cash flows expected to be derived from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets. Assets identified as impaired are adjusted to estimated fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are evaluated each reporting period for impairment based on a qualitative assessment and are then measured at fair value if an impairment is determined to exist. See Notes 5 and 11 for discussion of asset impairment charges.

Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue based on the satisfaction of distinct obligations to transfer goods and services to customers. The Company’s revenue is generated primarily from product or equipment sales. The Company also generates revenue from custom design and installation services as well as bundled sales arrangements that include product, software and services. The Company applies a five-step approach as defined in ASC 606,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers,
 in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when a corresponding performance obligation is satisfied. Most contracts with customers are to provide distinct products or services within a single contract. However, if a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, the total transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling price.
Product sales to end-customers or distributors represent over 
90
% of the Company’s revenue and are recognized at a point-in-time, which is generally at the point in time when products have been shipped, right to payment has been obtained and risk of loss has been transferred. 
Certain of the Company’s product performance obligations include proprietary operating system software, which typically is not considered separately identifiable. Therefore, sales of these products and the related software are considered one performance obligation.
License contracts include revenue recognized for the licensing of intellectual property, including software, sold separately without products. Functional intellectual property licenses do not meet the criteria for revenue to be recognized over time, and revenue is most commonly recognized upon delivery of the license/software to the customer.
The Company has service arrangements where net sales are recognized over time. These arrangements include a variety of post-contract support service offerings, which are generally recognized over time as the services are provided, including the following: maintenance and support services provided under annual service-level agreements; “Day 2” professional services to help customers maximize their utilization of deployed systems; and installation services related to the routine installation of equipment ordered by the customer at the customer’s site.
Revenue is measured based on the consideration the Company expects to be entitled based on customer contracts. Sales are adjusted for variable consideration amounts, including, but not limited to, estimated discounts, rebates, distributor price protection programs and returns. These estimates are determined based upon historical experience, contract terms, inventory levels in the distributor channel and other related factors. Adjustments to variable consideration estimates are recorded when circumstances indicate revisions may be necessary. Variable consideration is primarily related to the Company’s sales to distributors, system integrators and value-added resellers.
A contract liability for deferred revenue is recorded when consideration is received or is unconditionally due from a customer prior to transferring control of goods or services to the customer under the terms of a contract. Deferred revenue balances typically result from advance payments received from customers for product contracts or from billings in excess of revenue recognized on services arrangements.

Unbilled receivables are recorded when revenues are recognized in advance of invoice issuance.
 These assets are presented on a combined basis with accounts receivable and are converted to accounts receivable once the Company’s right to the consideration becomes unconditional, which varies by contract but is generally based on achieving certain acceptance milestones. The Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset would be one year or less.
Shipping and Handling Costs
The Company includes shipping and handling costs billed to customers in net sales and includes the costs incurred to transport product to customers as well as certain internal handling costs, which relate to activities to prepare goods for shipment, as cost of sales. Shipping and handling costs incurred after control is transferred to the customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are not accounted for as separate revenue obligations.

Tax Collected from Customers

Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, which are collected by the Company from customers, are excluded from net sales.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred and are reflected in selling, general and administrative expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Advertising expense 
was $
20.9
 million, $
21.4
 million and $
30.6
 mi
llion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, respectively.
Research and Development
Research and development (R&D) costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. R&D costs include materials and equipment that have no alternative future use, depreciation on equipment and facilities currently used for R&D purposes, personnel costs, contract services and reasonable allocations of indirect costs, if clearly related to an R&D activity. Expenditures in the pre-production phase of an R&D project are recorded as R&D expense. However, costs incurred in the pre-production phase that are associated with output actually used in production are recorded in cost of sales. A project is considered finished with pre-production efforts when management determines that it has achieved acceptable levels of scrap and yield, which vary by project. Expenditures related to ongoing production are recorded in cost of sales.
Restructuring
The Company records restructuring charges associated with management-approved restructuring plans, which could include the elimination of job functions, closure or relocation of facilities, reorganization of operations, changes in management structure, workforce reductions or other actions. Restructuring charges may include ongoing and enhanced termination benefits related to employee separations, contract termination costs, impairment of certain assets and other related costs associated with exit or disposal activities. Severance benefits are provided to employees primarily under the Company’s ongoing benefit arrangements. These severance costs are accrued once management commits to a plan of termination and it becomes probable that employees will be separated and entitled to benefits at amounts that can be reasonably estimated. In some instances, the Company enhances its ongoing termination benefits with one-time termination benefits, which are recognized when employees are notified of their enhanced termination benefits.
Foreign Currency Translation
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, approximately 
34
%, 
34
% and 
33
%, respectively, of the Company’s net sales were to customers located outside the U.S. A portion of these sales was denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, particularly sales from the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. The financial position and results of operations of certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Revenues and expenses of these subsidiaries have been translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries have been translated at the exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Translation gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Upon sale or liquidation of an investment in a foreign subsidiary, the amount of net translation gains or losses that have been accumulated in other comprehensive loss attributable to that investment are reported as a gain or loss in earnings in the period in which the sale or liquidation occurs.
Aggregate foreign currency gains and losses, such as those resulting from the settlement of receivables or payables, foreign currency contracts and short-term intercompany advances in a currency other than the subsidiary’s functional currency, are recorded currently in earnings (included in other income, net) and resulted in gains (
losses) of $
9.5
 million, $(
7.6
) million and $(
4.0
) mill
ion during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, respectively. Foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses related to certain long-term intercompany loans that are not expected to be settled in the foreseeable future are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Equity-Based Compensation

The estimated fair value of stock awards is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. Forfeitures of stock awards are recognized as they occur. The Company records deferred tax assets related to compensation expense for awards that are expected to result in future tax deductions for the Company, based on the amount of compensation cost recognized and the Company’s statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which it expects to receive a deduction. Differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and actual tax deductions reported on the Company’s income tax return are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within income tax expense benefit.
Income Taxes
Deferred income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance, when appropriate, to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

Tax benefits that result from uncertain tax positions may be recognized only if they are considered more likely than not to be sustainable, based on their technical merits. The amount of benefit to be recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is at least 
50
% likely to be realized.

In addition, the Company does not provide for U.S. taxes related to the foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on its long-term intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries. These loans are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future, and the foreign currency gains and losses are therefore recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss.

The Company records the income tax effects related to the activity of its defined benefit plans and hedging instruments in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the currently enacted tax rate and reclassifies it to net income (loss) in the same period that the related pre-tax accumulated comprehensive income (loss) reclassifications are recognized.
Earnings (Loss) Per Share
Basic earnings (loss) per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income (loss), less any dividends related to the Series A convertible preferred stock (Convertible Preferred Stock), by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The numerator in diluted EPS is based on the basic EPS numerator, adjusted to add back any dividends related to the Convertible Preferred Stock, subject to antidilution requirements. The denominator used in diluted EPS is based on the basic EPS computation plus the effect of potentially dilutive common shares related to the Convertible Preferred Stock and equity-based compensation plans, subject to antidilution requirements.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
,

Concentrations of Risk

Non-derivative financial instruments used by the Company in the normal course of business include letters of credit and commitments to extend credit, primarily accounts receivable. The Company generally does not require collateral on its accounts receivable. These financial instruments involve risk, including the credit risk of nonperformance by the counterparties to those instruments, and the actual loss may exceed the reserves provided in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 18 for further discussion of customer-related concentrations of risk.

The Company manages its exposures to credit risk associated with accounts receivable using tools such as credit approvals, credit limits and monitoring procedures. CommScope estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the actual payment history and individual circumstances of significant customers as well as the age of receivables. In management’s opinion, as of December 31, 2024, the Company did not have significant unreserved risk of credit loss due to the non-performance of customers or other counterparties related to amounts receivable. However, an adverse change in financial condition of a significant customer or group of customers or in the telecommunications industry could materially affect the Company’s estimates related to doubtful accounts.

The principal raw materials and components purchased by CommScope (aluminum, copper, steel, bimetals, optical fiber, plastics and other polymers, capacitors, memory devices and silicon chips) are subject to changes in market price as these materials are linked to various commodity markets. The Company attempts to mitigate these risks through effective requirements planning and by working closely with its key suppliers to obtain the best possible pricing and delivery terms.

The Company relies on sole suppliers or a limited group of suppliers for certain key components (memory devices, capacitors and silicon chips), subassemblies and modules and a limited group of contract manufacturers to manufacture a significant portion of its products. Any disruption or termination of these arrangements could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Adopted in 2024
On January 1, 2024, the Company adopted Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. 
The new guidance improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures for significant segment expenses. The guidance was effective retrospectively for the Company as of January 1, 2024 for the annual period. The guidance is effective retrospectively for the Company as of January 1, 2025 for the interim periods. As a result, the Company has enhanced its segment disclosures to include the presentation of significant cost and expenses by segment. The adoption of this ASU only affects the Company’s disclosures, with no impacts to the financial condition and results of operations.
On January 1, 2024, the Company adopted the rollforward disclosure requirement of ASU No. 2022-04, 
Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations.
 The new guidance improves the transparency of supplier finance programs by requiring that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose sufficient qualitative and quantitative information about the program to allow a user of its financial statements to understand the program’s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period and potential effect on an entity’s financial statements. The requirement to disclose rollforward information was effective prospectively for the Company as of January 1, 2024. The impact of adopting this new guidance was not material to the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Issued but Not Adopted

In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2024-04, 
Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20): Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments.
 The new guidance improves the relevance and consistency in application of the induced conversion guidance in Subtopic 410-20. The amendments in this update clarify the requirements for determining whether settlements of convertible debt instruments should be accounted for as an induced conversion. The guidance also addresses the settlement of convertible debt instruments that are not currently convertible and provides additional clarifications to assist stakeholders in applying the guidance. The guidance is effective for the Company on a prospective or retrospective basis, beginning January 1, 2026 for the interim and annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, 
Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40). 
The new guidance improves disclosures for expenses of public entities and addresses requests from investors for more detailed information about the types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. Coupled with recent standards that enhanced the disaggregation of revenue and income tax information, the disaggregated expense information required by these amendments will enable investors to better understand the major components of an entity's income statement. The guidance is effective for the Company on a prospective or retrospective basis, as of January 1, 2027 for the annual period. Early adoption is permitted. As this ASU relates to disclosures only, there will be no impact to CommScope’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-01, 
Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718).
 The amendments in this guidance include clarification on how entities should apply the scope guidance in Topic 718 when determining whether profits interest and similar awards should be accounted for in accordance with Topic 718. The guidance is effective for the Company on a prospective or retrospective basis, beginning January 1, 2026 for the interim and annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements.
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued ASU No. 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740):
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
. The new guidance is expected to improve income tax disclosures by requiring additional
information related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid, including 1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of
information in the rate reconciliation and 2) disaggregation of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The guidance is effective for the
Company on a prospective or retroactive basis, beginning January 1, 2025 for the annual period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on the consolidated financial
statements.

3. ACQUISITIONS
On June 7, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets of Casa Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Casa), which provides telecommunication infrastructure equipment and software-centric infrastructure solutions that allow cable service providers to deliver voice, video and data services over a single platform. The acquired assets included, among other things, accounts receivable, specified inventory, intellectual property and intellectual property rights, certain specified contracts, including facility leases, equipment and other personal property (collectively, the Casa Assets). As part of the Casa Transaction, the Company assumed certain specified liabilities, including certain cure costs related to assumed contracts and liabilities under such contracts and relating to the employment of continuing employees, in each case, arising after the consummation of the acquisition (collectively, the Casa Liabilities).
The sale was conducted pursuant to the Bid Procedures established in the chapter 11 cases of Casa Systems, Inc. and certain affiliates in the Bankruptcy Court. Pursuant to the Bid Procedures, the Company was designated as the successful bidder following an auction held on May 29, 2024. On June 5, 2024, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order authorizing the sale of the Casa Assets to the Company pursuant to Section 363 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (subject to the terms thereof). The sale closed on June 7, 2024 and, at such time, the Company funded the purchase price of $
45.1
 million and settled certain assumed Casa Liabilities, with cash on hand.
The Company is integrating this strategic acquisition into its ANS segment and expects the acquisition to strengthen its ANS segment’s position by enhancing its virtual CMTS and PON product offerings, which will enable customers to migrate to DAA solutions at their own speed, and further grow its customer base.
The Company recorded the purchase of the Casa Transaction using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, 
Business Combinations
, and, accordingly, recognized the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. As of December 31, 2024, the acquisition is substantially complete, with the exception of pending information on certain accounts receivable, of which the final determination of the fair value will be completed within the one-year measurement period.
The following amounts represent the preliminary determination of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Casa Transaction as of the acquisition date:

CommScope Holding Company, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
(In millions, unless otherwise noted)

The goodwill arising from the Casa Transaction is believed to result from the company’s reputation in the marketplace and assembled workforce and is expected to be fully deductible for income tax purposes.
Various valuation techniques which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs as defined by the fair value hierarchy, were used to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Using these valuation approaches requires the Company to make certain estimates and assumptions.
The table below summarizes the preliminary valuations of the intangible assets acquired that were determined by management to meet the criteria for recognition apart from goodwill and determined to have finite lives.

The Company recognized $

related to the Casa Transaction for the year ended December 31, 2024, and these costs were recognized in selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements

4.    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
On January 31, 2025, the Company completed the previously announced sale of the OWN segment and the DAS business unit of the NICS segment to Amphenol, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement dated July 18, 2024, in exchange for approximately $
2.1
 billion in cash.
The OWN segment and DAS business unit qualified as “held for sale” per ASC 360-10 in the third quarter of 2024 and were classified as a discontinued operation per ASC 205-20, as the Company determined, qualitatively and quantitatively, that this transaction represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results. As such, activity directly attributable to the OWN segment and DAS business unit has been removed from continuing operations and presented in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. In addition, all assets and liabilities of the OWN segment and DAS business unit were classified as assets and liabilities held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
On January 9, 2024, the Company completed the sale of the Home business to Vantiva pursuant to the Call Option Agreement entered into on October 2, 2023 and
 the Purchase Agreement dated as of December 7, 2023, in exchange for (i) 
134,704,669
 shares of Vantiva common stock representing a 
24.73
% equity stake in Vantiva (determined on a fully diluted basis), (ii) $
250,465
 in cash (in addition to cash paid in exchange for the cash on the Home business companies’ balance sheets) and (iii) an earn-out of up to $
100
 million in the aggregate. The earn-out payments are contingent upon Vantiva achieving adjusted EBITDA equal to or greater than €
400
 million for one or more of Vantiva’s first five fiscal years following the closing of the transaction. The earn-out payment with respect to any fiscal year will be subject to an additional annual cap, the amount of which will depend on certain elections made by the Company following Vantiva reaching the €
400
 million adjusted EBITDA threshold for the first time, and on Vantiva’s maintenance of certain liquidity levels (after giving effect to such payment).

CommScope Holding Company, Inc.

(In millions, unless otherwise noted)

The Home business qualified as “held for sale” per ASC 360-10 in the fourth quarter of 2023 and was classified as a discontinued operation per ASC 205-20, as the Company determined, qualitatively and quantitatively, that this transaction represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results. As such, activity directly attributable to the Home business has been removed from continuing operations and presented in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. In addition, all assets and liabilities of the Home business were classified as assets and liabilities held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2023. In connection with the “held for sale” classification, the Company recognized a loss on classification as held for sale of $
203.4
 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Upon the closing of the transaction on January 9, 2024, the Company recognized an additional loss of $
56.4
 million on the disposal of the Home business for the year ended
 December 31, 2024. The Company also recorded a
 loss on impairment of $
19.2
 million, based on Level 3 valuation inputs which included contractual payment amounts and market comparable information, related to Home business patents. These losses were recorded in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
During the third quarter of 2023, a partial impairment of $
469.2
 million was recorded related to the Home segment’s intangible assets. The Company estimated the fair value of the asset group using Company-specific inputs, including estimates of consideration to be received upon the impending divestiture, as well as other market participant assumptions. The determination of the impairment charge was based on Level 3 valuation inputs. 
The loss was recorded in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
In conjunction with the closing of the Home business transaction, the Company entered into a transition service agreement with Vantiva (Vantiva TSA), whereby the Company provides and receives certain post-closing support on a transitional basis which is included in continuing operations in transition service agreement income. The terms of the Vantiva TSA vary based on the services provided thereunder, with the longest such term having a duration of sixteen months. The Vantiva TSA provides options to extend services for up to two renewal terms of three months each. Following the closing of the transaction, the Company also entered into a Supply Agreement with Vantiva (Vantiva Supply Agreement), whereby the Company sells certain retained inventory at cost, or market price if below cost, for a period of two years. The Company’s investment in Vantiva is accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and the carrying value of the investment is included in other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company recognized a loss on its investment of $
17.0
 million in the second quarter of 2024, as a result of recording its proportionate share of loss on its equity investment, which is recorded on a one-quarter lag basis in discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations beginning in the second quarter of 2024. The investment in the ordinary shares is subject to a lock-up period, until the earlier of eighteen months, or the occurrence of a change of control or the entry into an agreement that would result in a change of control, following closing.

Goodwill at December 31, 2022 reflects the reorganization of the Company’s segment structure, as disclosed in Note 1. As a result of the new segment structure and certain other intrasegment realignments, as of January 1, 2024, the Company assessed goodwill for impairment due to changes in the composition of certain reporting units. The Company performed impairment testing immediately before the change and after the change once goodwill was reallocated and determined that no goodwill impairment existed.
Additional goodwill of $
5.2
 million resulting from the Casa acquisition is included in the other activity above related to the ANS segment as of December 31, 2024.
During the third quarter of 2024, the Company completed an impairment analysis for goodwill recorded within the NICS reporting unit, which is impacted by the divestiture of the DAS business. The quantitative assessment was used, and the Company determined that the fair value of the impacted reporting unit exceeded the carrying value and that 
no
 impairment existed immediately prior to or subsequent to allocating goodwill to the disposal group that includes the DAS business. The Company allocated $
113.5
 million of goodwill to the disposal group based on the relative fair value of the DAS business as compared to the NICS reporting unit, along with $
504.3
 million of goodwill that was entirely attributable to its OWN reporting unit. Total goodwill for the disposal group of $
617.8
 million has been classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2024.
During the annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2024, 
no
 goodwill impairments were identified.
During the annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2023 and in conjunction with the development of the Company’s 2024 and long-range plans, the Company determined the goodwill balances in the ANS and BDCC reporting units were impaired and recorded partial impairment charges of $
46.4
 million and $
99.1
 million, respectively, in asset impairments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The impairment charges resulted from the Company’s assessment of further lower revenue growth and EBITDA margins in the fourth quarter of 2023, due to adverse impacts of market conditions on the current year profitability and estimated future business results and cash flows. The ANS reporting unit is the same as the ANS segment, and the BDCC reporting unit is part of the CCS reportable segment.
During the third quarter of 2023, the Company concluded that a triggering event occurred, primarily due to a sustained decrease in the market value of the Company’s debt and common stock affecting the overall business and changes in expected future cash flows due to reduced earnings forecasts and current macroeconomic conditions, including a rising interest rate environment. As a result, the Company performed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test for its ANS and BDCC reporting units and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $
425.9
 million in asset impairments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to partially write down the carrying amount of the goodwill in the ANS reporting unit. There was 
no
 impairment identified in the BDCC reporting unit within the CCS reportable segment.

CommScope Holding Company, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
(In millions, unless otherwise noted)

During the annual impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of 2022 and in conjunction with the development of its 2023 and long-range plans, the Company identified changes in the ANS reporting unit’s expected future cash flows due to various market trends expected to affect the business, including technology shifts affecting hardware sales, trends affecting bandwidth growth and other operational challenges, as well as an increase in the cost of capital. As a result, the Company determined the goodwill balance in the ANS reporting unit was impaired and recorded a $
1,119.6
 million impairment charge.
Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit involves uncertainties because it requires management to develop numerous assumptions, including assumptions about the future growth and potential volatility in revenues and costs, capital expenditures, industry economic factors and future business strategy. Changes in projected revenue growth rates, projected EBITDA margin percentages or estimated discount rates due to uncertain market conditions, terminal growth rates, lower market multiples, loss of one or more key customers, changes in the Company’s strategy, changes in technology or other factors could negatively affect the fair value in one or more of the Company’s reporting units and result in a material impairment charge in the future. 
See Note 11 for further discussion of the assumptions used in the valuations.

CommScope Holding Company, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
(In millions, unless otherwise noted)

On December 17, 2024, the Company completed certain refinancing transactions (the Transactions), including (i) the issuance and sale of $

 million in aggregate principal amount of 
9.500
% senior secured notes due 2031 (the 2031 Secured Notes)

Senior Secured Credit Facilities
Senior Secured Term Loan due 2029
On December 17, 2024, the Company entered into a term loan agreement providing the new 2029 Term Loan which will mature in December 2029. 
Borrowings under the 2029 Term loan will not amortize and will be due at final maturity. 
T
he 2029 Term Loan bears interest at (1) an adjusted Term SOFR rate, subject to certain adjustments, plus an applicable margin between 
4.50
% and 
5.50
% or (2) at the option of the Company, a base rate plus an applicable margin between 
3.50
% to 
4.50
%. 
The applicable margins were subsequently reduced by 
25
 basis points after repayment of certain indebtedness in connection with the sale of the OWN segment and the DAS business unit of the NICS segment as described in Note 20 in these consolidated financial statements. The 2029 Term Loan is subject to a Term SOFR floor of 
2.00
%.
Subject to certain conditions, the 2029 Term Loan may be increased or a new incremental term loan facility may be added to increase the capacity by an unlimited amount as long as on a pro forma basis the Company
’s first lien net leverage ratio does not exceed 
4.00
:1.00.
CommScope, LLC may voluntarily prepay loans under the 2029 Term Loan, subject to minimum amounts, with prior notice
, subject to a prepayment premium (other than in connection with a change of control or permitted disposition) equal to: (1) a customary make-whole premium for any prepayments within 
18
 months of the closing date of the 2029 Term Loan (or a 
3.0
% premium with respect to any prepayments in the first 
six months
 using the proceeds of a new equity issuance); (2) a 
3.0
% premium on amounts prepaid from and after 
18
 months after the closing date of the 2029 Term Loan and prior to 
30
 months after the closing date of the 2029 Term Loan; or (3) a 
1.0
% premium on amounts prepaid from and after 
30
 months after the closing date of the 2029 Term Loan and prior to 
42
 months after the closing date of the 2029 Term Loan.

CommScope, LLC must prepay the 2029 Term Loan with the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales, the incurrence or issuance of specified refinancing indebtedness and 
50
% of excess cash flow (such percentage subject to reduction based on the achievement of specified Consolidated First Lien Net Leverage Ratios), in each case, subject to certain reinvestment rights and other exceptions.
CommScope, LLC’s obligations under the 2029 Term Loan are guaranteed by the Company and each of CommScope, LLC’s direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (subject to certain permitted exceptions based on immateriality thresholds of aggregate assets and revenues of excluded U.S. subsidiaries). The 2029 Term Loan is secured by a lien on substantially all of CommScope, LLC’s and the guarantors’ current and fixed assets (subject to certain exceptions), and the 2029 Term Loan has a first-priority lien on all fixed assets and a second-priority lien on all current assets (second in priority to the liens securing the Revolving Credit Facility), in each case, subject to other permitted liens. Certain foreign subsidiaries of CommScope, LLC organized in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the Netherlands will become Subsidiary Guarantors. Additional foreign subsidiaries of CommScope, LLC may be added as Subsidiary Guarantors in the future.
The 2029 Term Loan contains customary negative covenants that limit CommScope, LLC's (and its subsidiaries’) ability to, among other things: (i) incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; (ii) pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions; (iii) make other restricted payments or investments; (iv) grant liens or security interests on assets; (v) transfer or sell assets; (vi) create restrictions on payment of dividends or other amounts to CommScope, LLC by CommScope, LLC’s subsidiaries; (vii) engage in mergers or consolidations; or (viii) engage in certain transactions with affiliates.
The 2029 Term Loan provides that, upon the occurrence of certain events of default, the obligations thereunder may be accelerated. Such events of default will include payment defaults to the lenders thereunder, material inaccuracies of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, material money judgments, material pension-plan events, change of control and other customary events of default.
No
 portion of the 2029 Term Loan was reflected as a current portion of long-term debt as of 
December 31, 2024 related to the potentially required excess cash flow payment because no such payment is expected to be required. There was no excess cash flow payment required in 2024 related to 2023.

In connection with entering into the new 2029 Term Loan, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $25.1 million and original issue discount of $
39.4
 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 which were recorded as a reduction of the carrying amount of the debt and are being amortized over the term of the 2029 Term Loan. The Company also incurred debt issuance costs
 of $4.9 million, reflected in other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility
On December 17, 2024, the Company amended its Revolving Credit Facility agreement which permits the 2029 Term Loan and 2031 Secured Notes to be guaranteed by foreign subsidiary guarantors that will also become borrowers or guarantors under the Revolving Credit Facility agreement on a post-closing basis, and to permit such entities to grant liens on their assets to secure such obligations. The amendment also removed the ability to have a Swiss borrowing base (as defined in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility) and includes an obligation to reduce the committed amount from $
1.0
 billion to $
750.0
 million. The Revolving Credit Facility provides borrowing capacity of up to $
750.0
 million, subject to certain limitations, available to CommScope, LLC and its U.S. subsidiaries designated as co-borrowers (the U.S. Revolving Borrowers). The ability to draw under the Revolving Credit Facility or issue letters of credit is conditioned upon, among other things, delivery of prior written notice of a borrowing or issuance, as applicable, the ability of the Revolving Borrowers to reaffirm the representations and warranties contained in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility and the absence of any default or event of default. As of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company had $
200.0
 million of outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and had availability of $
449.3
 million, after giving effect to borrowing base limitations and outstanding letters of credit.

Letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility are limited to the lesser of (x) $
250.0
 million and (y) the aggregate unused amount of commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility then in effect. Subject to certain conditions, the Revolving Credit Facility may be expanded by up to $
400.0
 million in additional commitments. Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility may be denominated, at the option of the Revolving Borrowers, (i) with respect to Tranche A Loans, in U.S. dollars, euros or pounds sterling, and (ii) with respect to Tranche B Loans, U.S. dollars, euros, pounds sterling or Swiss francs.
Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a floating rate, which can be either (1) an adjusted Term SOFR rate (for borrowings denominated in U.S. dollars), (2) the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) (for borrowings denominated in euros), (3) the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) (for borrowings denominated in pounds sterling) or (4) the Swiss Average Rate Overnight (SARON) (for borrowings denominated in Swiss francs), in each case, subject to certain adjustments plus an applicable margin of 
1.25
% to 
1.50
% or, at the option of the Revolving Borrowers, a base rate plus an applicable margin of 
0.25
% to 
0.50
%.
The obligations of the U.S. Revolving Borrowers under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company, CommScope, LLC and each of CommScope, LLC’s direct and indirect wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries (subject to certain permitted exceptions based on immateriality thresholds of aggregate assets and revenues of excluded U.S. subsidiaries). The Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of the U.S. Revolving Borrowers’ and the guarantors’ current and fixed assets (subject to certain exceptions). The Revolving Credit Facility has a first-priority lien on all current assets and a second-priority lien on all fixed assets (second in priority to the liens securing the 2029 Secured Notes, the 2026 Secured Notes and the 2026 Term Loan), in each case, subject to other permitted liens.

The following fees are applicable under the Revolving Credit Facility: (i) an unused line fee of (x) 
0.250
% per annum of the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility when the average unused portion of the facility is less than 50% of the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility or (y) 
0.375
% per annum of the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility when the average unused portion of the facility is equal to or greater than 50% of the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility; (ii) a letter of credit participation fee on the aggregate stated amount of each letter of credit equal to the applicable margin for adjusted Term SOFR, EURIBOR, SONIA and SARON loans, as applicable; (iii) a letter of credit fronting fee of 
0.125
% per annum, multiplied by the average aggregate daily maximum amount available to be drawn under all applicable letters of credit issued by such letter of credit issuer; and (iv) certain other customary fees and expenses of the lenders and agents thereunder.

The Revolving Borrowers will be required to make prepayments under the Revolving Credit Facility at any time when, and to the extent that, the aggregate amount of the outstanding loans and letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility exceeds the lesser of the aggregate amount of commitments in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility and the borrowing base.

The Revolving Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the ability of CommScope, LLC and its subsidiaries to merge and consolidate with other companies, incur indebtedness, grant liens or security interests on assets, make acquisitions, loans, advances or investments, pay dividends (except with respect to the Convertible Preferred Stock), sell or otherwise transfer assets, optionally prepay or modify terms of any junior indebtedness, enter into certain transactions with affiliates or change lines of business. 
The Revolving Credit Facility contains a Covenant Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility) of 
1.00
 to 1.00. The credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility provides that the Covenant Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio must be tested and must exceed the level set forth above only in the event that excess availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is less than the greater of $
80
 million and 
10
% of the maximum credit as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter.
 As of 
December 31, 2024, the Company’s excess availability and Covenant Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio were in excess of the Revolving Credit Facility’s requirements.

The Revolving Credit Facility provides that, upon the occurrence of certain events of default, the obligations thereunder may be accelerated and the lending commitments terminated. Such events of default include payment defaults, material inaccuracies of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy proceedings, material money judgments, material pension plan events, certain change of control events and other customary events of default.

Derivative Instruments Designated as Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk
The Company has utilized a hedging strategy to mitigate a portion of the exposure to changes in cash flows resulting from variable interest rates on the 2026 Term Loan. The hedging strategy extends to future borrowings or debt issued, to fix a portion of the future interest cash flows by designating qualifying receive-variable and pay-fixed interest rate swaps as a cash flow hedge for accounting and financial reporting purposes. In June 2023, and in conjunction with the amendment to the 2026 Term Loan due to reference rate reform, the Company settled and derecognized its cash flow hedges. A 
gain of $
6.1
 million remaining as a component of accumulated comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets continued to be reclassified to earnings through interest expense as the interest payments continued to be made on the 2026 Term Loan through December 17, 2024, at which time as a result of the refinancing transactions, the forecasted hedge transaction was no longer probable of occurring which resulted in a gain of $
3.1
 million being reclassified to earnings as an adjustment to interest expense.
The Company reenacted its hedging strategy in the third quarter of 2023, by entering into new interest rate swap derivatives with a total notional amount of $
700
 million which terminate on 
July 31, 2026
. As a result of the refinancing transaction and changes in the terms of the 2029 Term Loan, the Company dedesignated its interest rate swaps as of December 17, 2024 and redesignated $
700
 million of the swaps as hedging instruments on the same day. As a result, the Company 
will reclassify the frozen amount out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings through the December 2029 maturity of the new 2029 Term Loan or until terminated, and recognize the excluded component (i.e., off-market component of the swap) through earnings over the same period, which offset.
 The Company believes that floating rate debt in the amount of $
700
 million will exist through the interest rate swaps' maturity in July 2026 and therefore, will continue to apply hedge accounting to the interest rate swaps.
The total notional amount of the interest rate swap derivatives as of December 31, 2024
 was $
700.0
 million with outstanding maturities up to
 nineteen months
. There was no ineffectiveness on the instruments designated as cash flow hedges for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.

Non-Recurring Fair Value Measurements
The Company recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the Casa Transaction during the second quarter of 2024, as well as the respective measurement adjustments in the third and fourth quarters of 2024. The fair values were determined using Level 3 valuation inputs. See Note 3 in these consolidated financial statements.
During the first quarter of 2024, the Company recognized a loss on impairment of unutilized real estate within restructuring costs, net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value was determined using Level 3 valuation inputs. See Note 12 in these consolidated financial statements.
During the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2023
, a goodwill impairment charge of $
46.4
 million was recorded related to the ANS reporting unit which is the same as the ANS segment, and $
99.1
 million was recorded related to the BDCC reporting unit which is part of the CCS segment.
 The fair value of each reporting unit was determined using Level 3 valuation inputs with an approach consistent with the 2023 annual impairment test.
In the third quarter of 2023, a goodwill impairment charge of $
425.9
 million was recorded related to the ANS reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit was determined using Level 3 valuation inputs with an approach consistent with the 2023 annual impairment test.

(In millions, unless otherwise noted)

During the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2022, a goodwill impairment charge of $
1,119.6
 million was recorded related to the ANS reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit was determined using Level 3 valuation inputs with an approach consistent with the 2023 annual impairment test.
These fair value estimates are based on pertinent information available to management as of the valuation date. Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect these fair value estimates, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since those dates, and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented.

12.    RESTRUCTURING COSTS

The Company incurs costs associated with restructuring initiatives intended to improve overall operating performance and profitability. The costs related to restructuring actions are generally cash-based and primarily consist of employee-related costs, which include severance and other one-time termination benefits.

In addition to the employee-related costs, the Company records other costs associated with restructuring actions such as the gain or loss on the sale of facilities and impairment costs arising from unutilized real estate or equipment. The Company attempts to sell or lease this unutilized space but additional impairment charges may be incurred related to these or other excess assets.
The Company’s net pretax restructuring activity included in 
restructuring costs, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, by segment, was as follows:

These indirect expenses have been classified as continuing operations for all periods presented since the costs were not directly attributable to these discontinued operations. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, the corporate and other costs related to the Home segment have been reallocated to the Company’s remaining segments and partially offset by income from the Vantiva TSA. The corporate and other costs related to the OWN segment and DAS business unit will be reallocated to the Company’s remaining segments beginning in the first quarter of 2025.

(In millions, unless otherwise noted)

Plan Assets

In developing the expected rate of return on plan assets, the Company considered the expected long-term rate of return on individual asset classes. Expected return on plan assets is based on the market value of the assets. The majority of the non-U.S. pension assets are managed by independent investment advisors. In general, the investment strategy is designed to accumulate a diversified portfolio among markets, asset classes or individual securities in order to reduce market risk and assure that the pension assets are available to pay benefits as they come due.
Mutual funds classified as Level 1 are valued at net asset value, which is based on the fair value of the funds’ underlying securities. Certain mutual funds are classified as Level 2 because a portion of the funds’ underlying assets are valued using significant other observable inputs. Other assets are primarily composed of fixed income investments (including insurance and real estate products) and are valued based on the investment’s stated rate of return, which approximates market interest rates.

The Company had 
no
 U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets as of 
December 31, 2024 or 2023. The estimated fair values and the valuation input levels of the Company’s non-U.S. defined benefit pension plan assets are as follows:

In addition to the valuation allowances detailed above, the Company has also established a valuation allowance of $
3.4
 million against other deferred tax assets.

Under current U.S. tax regulations, repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. can generally be completed with no incremental U.S. tax. However, repatriation of foreign earnings could subject the Company to U.S. state and non-U.S. jurisdictional taxes (including withholding taxes) on distributions.

As of December 31, 2024
, the Company has a deferred tax liability of $
18.6
 million for the estimated foreign and state tax costs associated with the expected repatriation of the Company’s undistributed foreign earnings. The unrecorded deferred tax liability for foreign and state tax costs associated with earnings considered permanently reinvested is not material as of 
December 31, 2024.

The Company’s liability for unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in future periods was $
135.2
 million as of 
December 31, 2024. The Company operates in numerous jurisdictions worldwide and is subject to routine tax audits on a regular basis. The determination of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits involves significant management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and tax laws in each of these jurisdictions.

Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed and evaluated on an ongoing basis and may be adjusted for changing facts and circumstances including the lapse of applicable statutes of limitation and closure of tax examinations. Although the timing and outcome of such events are difficult to predict, the Company estimates that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding the impact of accrued interest and penalties, may be reduced by up to 
$
22.0
 million within the next twelve months.
The Company provides for interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. The Company accrued $
5.9
 million and $
5.4
 million for interest and penalties as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, the net expense (benefit) for interest and penalties recognized through income tax expense (benefit) was $
0.5
 million, $(
4.0
) million and $
0.1
 million, respectively.

The Company files federal, state and local tax returns with statutes of limitation generally ranging from 
3
 to 
4
 years. The Company is currently undergoing a U.S. federal income tax audit for the 2019 tax year and is generally no longer subject to state and local tax examinations for years prior to 2020. Tax returns filed by the Company’s significant foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to statutes of limitation of 
3
 to 
7
 years and are generally no longer subject to examination for years prior to 2018. In many jurisdictions, tax authorities retain the ability to review prior years’ tax returns and to adjust any net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards from these years that are available to be utilized in subsequent periods. During 
2024
, the Company recognized $(
14.2
) million (net of payments) related to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations and the conclusion of various domestic and foreign examinations.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has proposed a global minimum tax of 15% under its Pillar Two Model Rules. Beginning in 2023, many countries began to incorporate Pillar Two into their domestic laws with Pillar Two becoming effective in some countries beginning in 2024. In 2024, the company incurred insignificant tax expense in connection with Pillar Two.

15.     SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK
On April 4, 2019, the Company issued and sold 
1,000,000
 shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock for $
1.0
 billion, or $
1,000
 per share, pursuant to an Investment Agreement between the Company and The Carlyle Group (Carlyle), dated 
November 8, 2018
 (the Investment Agreement). As of 
December 31, 2024
, the Company had authorized 
1,400,000
 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.
Dividend Rights
The Convertible Preferred Stock ranks senior to the shares of the Company’s common stock with respect to dividend rights and rights on the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company. The Convertible Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference of $
1,000
 per share. 
Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 
5.5
% per year, payable quarterly in arrears.
 If CommScope does not declare and pay a dividend, the dividend rate will increase by 
2.5
% to 
8.0
% per year (and that rate will increase by an additional 
0.50
% every three months until such unpaid dividend is declared and paid, subject to a cap of 
11.0
% per year) until all accrued but unpaid dividends have been paid in full. Dividends can be paid in cash, in-kind through the issuance of additional shares of Convertible Preferred Stock or any combination of the two, at the Company’s option.

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
, the Company paid dividends in-kind of $
65.2
 million, $
61.8
 million and $
44.2
 million, respectively, which were recorded as additional Convertible Preferred Stock on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company did 
no
t pay cash dividends for the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023, but did pay cash dividends of $
14.9
 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Conversion Features
The Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible at the option of the holders at any time into shares of CommScope common stock at an initial conversion rate of 
36.3636
 shares of common stock per share of the Convertible Preferred Stock (equivalent to $
27.50
 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to customary anti-dilution and other adjustments. At any time after the third anniversary of the issuance of the Convertible Preferred Stock, if the volume weighted average price of CommScope’s common stock exceeds the conversion price of $
49.50
, as may be adjusted pursuant to the Certificate of Designations, for at least thirty trading days in any period of forty-five consecutive trading days (including the final five trading days of any such forty-five-trading day period) all of the Convertible Preferred Stock may be converted at the election of CommScope into the relevant number of shares of CommScope common stock.
Redemption Rights
On any date during the three months following the eight year and six-month anniversary of the Investment Agreement closing date and the three months following each anniversary thereafter, holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock will have the right to require CommScope to redeem all or any portion of the Convertible Preferred Stock at 
100
% of the liquidation preference thereof plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. The redemption price is payable, at the Company’s option, in cash or a combination of cash and common stock, subject to certain restrictions.

112

CommScope Holding Company, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
(In millions, unless otherwise noted)

Upon certain change of control events involving CommScope, CommScope has the right, subject to the holder’s right to convert prior to such redemption, to redeem all of the Convertible Preferred Stock for the greater of (i) an amount in cash equal to the sum of the liquidation preference of the Convertible Preferred Stock, all accrued but unpaid dividends and, if the applicable redemption date is prior to the fifth anniversary of the first dividend payment date, the present value, discounted at a rate of 
10
%, of any remaining scheduled dividends through the five year anniversary of the first dividend payment date, assuming CommScope chose to pay such dividends in cash and (ii) the consideration the holders would have received if they had converted their shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock into CommScope common stock immediately prior to the change of control event.
To the extent that CommScope does not exercise the redemption right described above, following the effective date of any such change of control event, the holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock can require CommScope to repurchase the Convertible Preferred Stock at the greater of (i) an amount in cash equal to 
100
% of the liquidation preference thereof plus all accrued but unpaid dividends and (ii) the consideration the holders would have received if they had converted their shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock into CommScope common stock immediately prior to the change of control event.
Voting Rights
Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to vote with the holders of the Company’s common stock on an as-converted basis. Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled to a separate class vote with respect to, among other things, amendments to CommScope’s organizational documents that have an adverse effect on the Convertible Preferred Stock, issuances by CommScope of securities that are senior to, or equal in priority with, the Convertible Preferred Stock and issuances of shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock after the closing date of the ARRIS International plc (
ARRIS) acquisition, other than shares issued as dividends with respect to shares of the Convertible Preferred Stock.

16.    STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Equity-Based Compensation Plans
In 2019, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan authorizing 
8.0
 million shares for issuance, plus additional shares underlying awards outstanding under the predecessor plans. Subsequently, in each of the years 2020 through 2024, the Company’s stockholders approved the Amended and Restated 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2019 Plan) and authorized an additional aggregate 
34.1
 million shares for issuance. All future equity awards will be made from the 2019 Plan. Awards under the 2019 Plan may include stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock units (including restricted stock units (RSUs) and deferred stock units), performance awards (represents any of the awards already listed with a performance-vesting component), other stock-based awards and cash-based awards. As of 
December 31, 2024
, there were 
5.9
 million shares available for future grants under the 2019 Plan.
As of December 31, 2024
, $
31.6
 million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options, RSUs and performance share units (PSUs) is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 
1.6
 years. There were 
no
 significant capitalized equity-based compensation costs at 
December 31, 2024.

CommScope Holding Company, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
(In millions, unless otherwise noted)

The Company believes the valuation techniques and the approaches utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in estimating the fair values of its equity-based compensation. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive equity awards. Subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by the Company.
Stock Options
Stock options are awards that allow the recipient to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a fixed price. Stock options are granted at an exercise price equal to the Company’s stock price at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock options at the date of grant. These awards generally vest over 
five years
 following the grant date and have a contractual term of
 ten years
. There were 
1.6
 million options outstanding as of 
December 31, 2024
 with 
no
 intrinsic value and the majority were vested. There were 
no
 stock options granted during the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022. The intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was not material.
Restricted Stock Units

RSUs entitle the holder to shares of common stock after a vesting period of generally 
three years
. The fair value of the awards is determined on the grant date based on the Company’s stock price.

December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022
 was $
32.9
 million, $
48.3
 million and $
61.8
 million, respectively.
Performance Share Units
PSUs are stock awards in which the number of shares ultimately received by the employee depends on achievement towards a performance measure. Certain of CommScope’s PSUs have an internal performance measure and the awards vest at the end of three years. The number of shares issued under these awards can vary between 
0
% and 
300
% of the number of PSUs granted. The fair value of these awards is determined on the date of grant based on the Company’s stock price.
CommScope also has PSUs with a market condition performance measure based on stock price milestones over a three-year period. The number of shares issued under these awards can vary between 
0
% to 
100
% of the number of PSUs granted. In addition, the Company has PSUs with a market condition based on the Company’s total stockholder return (TSR) ranking relative to the S&P 500 TSR for a three-year period. The number of shares issued under these awards can vary between 
0
% to 
200
% of the number of PSUs granted. The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of PSUs with a market condition performance measure at the date of grant. Key assumptions used in the model include the risk-free interest rate, which reflects the yield on zero-coupon U.S. treasury securities, and stock price volatility, which is derived based on the historical volatility of the Company’s stock.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, certain PSUs expired as the performance measure stock price milestone was not met. Consequently, 
no
 shares were issued related to these awards.

120.0
 million (undiscounted) and based on meeting certain minimum purchase requirements through 2031, such advance payments will be credited and applied to future orders on a quarterly basis beginning in 2027 through 2031. Advance payments of $
60.0
 million and $
30.0
 million are recorded as other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023

Legal Proceedings
The Company is a party to certain intellectual property claims and also periodically receives notices asserting that its products infringe on another party’s patents and other intellectual property rights. These claims and assertions, whether against the Company directly or against its customers, could require the Company to pay damages or royalties, stop offering the relevant products and/or cease other activities. The Company may also be called upon to indemnify certain customers for costs related to products sold to such customers. The outcome of these claims and notices is uncertain, and a reasonable estimate of the loss from unfavorable outcomes in certain of these matters either cannot be determined or is estimated at the minimum amount of a range of estimates. The actual loss, through settlement or trial, could be material and may vary significantly from the Company’s estimates. From time to time, the Company may also be involved as a plaintiff in intellectual property claims. Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized.
The Company is either a plaintiff or a defendant in certain other pending legal matters in the normal course of business. Management believes none of these other pending legal matters will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business or financial condition upon final disposition.
The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing the use, discharge, disposal and remediation of hazardous materials. Compliance with current laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a materially adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

18.    INDUSTRY SEGMENTS, MAJOR CUSTOMERS, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION
Segment Information
As a result of the pending sale of the OWN segment and DAS business unit, and the divestiture of the Home business, the Company manages its continuing operations and is reporting financial performance based on the following remaining three operating segments: CCS, NICS and ANS. In addition, as of January 1, 2024, management shifted certain product lines from the Company’s CCS segment to its ANS segment to better align with how the businesses are managed. For all periods presented, amounts have been recast to reflect these operating segment changes.
The following is a brief description of the activities of the Company's business segments:
CCS
 - The segment provides fiber optic and copper connectivity and cable solutions for use in telecommunications, cable television, residential broadband networks, data centers and business enterprises. The CCS portfolio includes network solutions for indoor and outdoor network applications. Indoor network solutions include optical fiber and twisted pair structured cable solutions, intelligent infrastructure management hardware and software and network rack and cabinet enclosures. Outdoor network solutions are used in both local-area and wide-area networks and “last mile” fiber-to-the-home installations, including deployments of fiber-to-the-node, fiber-to-the-premises and fiber-to-the-distribution-point to homes, businesses and cell sites.
NICS
 - The segment provides wireless networks for enterprises and service providers. Product offerings include indoor cellular solutions such as public key infrastructure solutions, indoor and outdoor Wi-Fi and long-term evolution (LTE) access points, access and aggregation switches; an Internet of Things suite, on-premises and cloud-based control and management systems; and software and software-as-a-service applications addressing security, location, reporting and analytics.
ANS
 - The segment’s product solutions include cable modem termination systems, video infrastructure, distribution and transmission equipment and cloud solutions that enable facility-based service providers to construct a state-of-the-art residential and metro distribution network.

Assets related to business segments largely include accounts receivable, inventories, property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and certain limited other assets. All other items are reflected in Corporate and other. Accounts receivable and inventory are ascribed based on underlying sales or activity. Property, plant and equipment are attributed to a particular business segment based on that item’s primary user and reflect an allocation of certain corporate-shared assets. Intangible assets and goodwill are largely directly associated with a particular reporting unit and attributed on that basis.
(2)
The corporate and other line item above reflects assets related to the OWN segment and DAS business unit which are not expected to transfer upon sale.
(3)
The Home business assets line item above reflects certain assets retained by the Company related to the Home business, with the primary asset being net inventory related to the Home business in the amount of $
14.5
 and $
88.0
 million as of 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
, respectively. The Company has entered into the Vantiva Supply Agreement, pursuant to which the Company will sell the retained inventory to Vantiva at cost, or market price if below cost, for a period of two years following the close of the transaction.
The Company organizes its business segments based on the nature of products and services offered. Segment information is presented on the same basis that the Company's 
Chief Executive Officer
, who is the chief operating decision maker, uses to manage its segments, evaluate financials results and make key operating decisions. 
The Company’s measurement of segment performance is adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization). The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as operating income (loss), adjusted to exclude depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring costs, asset impairments, equity-based compensation, transaction, transformation and integration costs and other items that the Company believes are useful to exclude in the evaluation of operating performance from period to period because these items are not representative of the Company’s recurring business.
These financial metrics are used to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions and monitor budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis. To manage operations and make decisions regarding resource allocations, the Company’s chief operating decision-maker is regularly provided and reviews expense information at a consolidated level for each segment. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing the Company’s strategic initiatives.

On January 31, 2025, the Company completed the previously announced sale of the OWN segment and the DAS business unit of the NICS segment to Amphenol, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement dated July 18, 2024, in exchange for approximately $
2.1
 billion in cash.

The proceeds from the sale of the OWN segment and the DAS business unit were used to pay fees and expenses associated with the transactions and to repay all outstanding amounts under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility, to repay in part the 2029 Secured Notes and to repay in full the 2026 Secured Notes (collectively, the Debt Repayment). In connection with the repayment of all outstanding amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility on January 31, 2025, the committed amount thereunder was reduced to $
750.0
 million, subject to borrowing base limitations.
On February 3, 2025, the Company completed (i) the redemption of $
299,000,000
 in aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Secured Notes, and following the redemption, $
951,000,000
 in aggregate principal amount of the 2029 Secured Notes remain outstanding and (ii) the redemption of all amounts outstanding under the 2026 Secured Notes. In connection with the redemption in full of the 2026 Secured Notes, the indenture governing the 2026 Secured Notes was satisfied and discharged. Following the 
consummation of the Debt Repayment on February 3, 2025, the conditions precedent were met for a 25 basis point reduction in the applicable margin on the 2029 Term Loan.

TANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not applicable.

ITEM  9A. CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report.

Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, these disclosure controls and procedures were effective and operating to provide reasonable assurance that information that we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of CommScope is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

•
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; 

•
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and 

•
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. 

CommScope’s management assessed the effectiveness of CommScope’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, CommScope’s management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, CommScope’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the COSO internal control criteria.

CommScope’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of CommScope’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

123

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Because of their inherent limitations, our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all material errors or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to risks, including that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with our policies or procedures may deteriorate.
