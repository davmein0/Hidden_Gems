ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our fixed assets include factories and warehouses and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment. Our factories, warehouses and machinery and equipment are generally in good operating condition, are reasonably maintained and substantially all of our facilities are in regular use. We consider the present level of fixed assets along with planned capital expenditures to be suitable and adequate for operations in the current business environment. As of December 31, 2024, excluding the properties related to the sale of the OWN segment and DAS business unit, we operated approximately 19 manufacturing facilities with approximately 3.6 million square feet, of which approximately 0.8 million square feet were leased. Manufacturing facilities located in the U.S. had approximately 1.5 million square feet, of which approximately 0.1 million square feet were leased. Manufacturing facilities located outside the U.S. had approximately 2.1 million square feet, of which approximately 0.7 million square feet were leased. The square footage by segment related to these manufacturing facilities was approximately 3.3 million square feet, 0.2 million square feet and 0.1 million square feet for the CCS segment, NICS segment and ANS segment, respectively, as of December 31, 2024.

We believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate for our business and are being appropriately utilized for their intended purposes. Utilization of our facilities varies based on demand for the related products. We regularly review our anticipated requirements for facilities and, based on that review, may from time to time acquire or lease additional facilities and/or dispose of existing facilities.
