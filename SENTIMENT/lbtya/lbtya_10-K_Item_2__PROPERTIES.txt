Item 2.  PROPERTIES
We lease our corporate offices in London, U.K., in Denver, Colorado, U.S. and in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. All of our other real or personal property is owned or leased by our subsidiaries and affiliates.
Our subsidiaries and affiliates own or lease the fixed assets necessary for the operation of their respective businesses, including office space, transponder space, head-end facilities, rights of way, cable television and telecommunications distribution equipment, telecommunications switches, base stations, cell towers, CPE and other property necessary for their operations. The physical components of their broadband networks require maintenance and periodic upgrades to support the new services and products they introduce. Subject to these maintenance and upgrade activities, our management believes that our current facilities are suitable and adequate for our business operations for the foreseeable future.
