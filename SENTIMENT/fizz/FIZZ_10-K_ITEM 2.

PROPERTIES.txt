ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

Our principal properties include twelve production facilities located in ten states, which aggregate approximately two million square feet. We own ten production facilities in the following states: California (2), Georgia, Kansas, Michigan (2), Ohio, Texas, Utah and Washington. Two production facilities, located in Maryland and Florida, are leased subject to agreements that expire through 2035. We believe our facilities are generally in good condition and sufficient to meet our present needs.

The production of beverages is capital intensive but is not characterized by rapid technological change. The technological advances that have occurred have generally been of an incremental cost-saving nature, such as the industry’s conversion to lighter weight containers or improved blending processes that enhance ingredient yields. We are not aware of any anticipated industry-wide changes in technology that would adversely impact our current physical production capacity or cost of production.
