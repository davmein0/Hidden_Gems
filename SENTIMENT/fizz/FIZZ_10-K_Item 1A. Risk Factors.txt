Table of Contents

Net Sales

Net sales for Fiscal 2025 increased 0.8% to $1,201.4 million compared to $1,191.7 million for Fiscal 2024. The increase in sales resulted primarily from a 1.7% increase in average selling price per case and an additional selling week, partially offset by a 0.9% decrease in case volume. The decrease in case volume primarily impacted Power+ Brands, partially offset by an increase in carbonated soft drink brands
.

Gross Profit

Gross profit for Fiscal 2025 increased to $443.9 million compared to $428.5 million for Fiscal 2024. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to a decline in packaging costs and the increase in average selling price per case, partially offset by the decrease in case volume. The average cost of sales per case remained relatively unchanged and gross margin increased to 37.0% compared to 36.0% for Fiscal 2024.

Shipping and handling costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, the classification of which is consistent with many beverage companies. However, our gross margin may not be comparable to companies that include shipping and handling costs in cost of sales. See Note 1-Significant Accounting Policies, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses for Fiscal 2025 decreased $1.4 million to $208.5 million from $209.9 million for Fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily due to reduced marketing spending and a decline in shipping and handling costs. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 17.4% compared to 17.6% in Fiscal 2024
.

Other Income (Expense), net

Other income (expense), net includes primarily interest income of $9.3 million for Fiscal 2025 and $12.2 million for Fiscal 2024. The decrease in interest income is due to decreased average invested balances.

Income Taxes

For Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, our effective tax rates were 23.6% and 23.1%, respectively. The differences between the effective rate and the federal statutory rate of 21% were primarily due to the effects of state income taxes.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash-equivalents, cash generated from operations and borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facilities. At May 3, 2025, we had $193.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and maintained unsecured revolving credit facilities totaling $150 million, under which no borrowings were outstanding and $2.7 million was reserved for standby letters of credit. We believe that existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital requirements for the next twelve months. See Note 5 - Debt, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Pursuant to a management agreement, we incurred fees to Corporate Management Advisors, Inc. (“CMA”) of $12.0 million and $11.9 million for Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, respectively. At May 3, 2025 and April 27, 2024, current liabilities included amounts due to CMA of $2.1 million and $3.0 million, respectively. See Note 6 - Capital Stock and Transactions with Related Parties, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cash Flows

The Company’s cash position decreased $133.2 million in Fiscal 2025 primarily due to the payment of a special cash dividend of $304.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Net cash provided by operating activities for Fiscal 2025 was $206.7 million compared to $197.9 million for Fiscal 2024. For Fiscal 2025, cash flow provided by operating activities was principally provided by an increase in net income, partially offset by an increase in working capital excluding cash.

Net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2025 reflects capital expenditures of $36.3 million, compared to capital expenditures of $30.2 million for Fiscal 2024. Expenditures for property, plant and equipment in Fiscal 2025 were primarily for capital projects to expand our capacity, enhance sustainability and packaging capabilities and improve efficiencies at our production facilities. We intend to continue such projects in Fiscal 2026 and anticipate Fiscal 2026 capital expenditures will not exceed Fiscal 2025 capital spending.

Net cash used in financing activities for Fiscal 2025 reflects payment of a special cash dividend of $304.1 million. No dividends were paid during Fiscal 2024.

Financial Position

During Fiscal 2025, our working capital decreased $131.7 million to $267.2 million. The decrease in working capital and current ratio was primarily due to the payment of the $304.1 million cash dividend. Trade receivables increased $1.3 million and days sales outstanding was 32.5 days at May 3, 2025 compared to 31.5 days at April 27, 2024. Inventories increased $0.5 million as a result of increased quantities of finished goods and raw materials. Annual inventory turns increased to 8.7 times from 8.6 times. At May 3, 2025, the current ratio was 2.9 to 1 compared to 3.9 to 1 at April 27, 2024.

We contribute to certain pension plans under collective bargaining agreements and to a discretionary profit-sharing plan. Annual contributions were $4.2 million and $3.8 million for Fiscal 2025 and Fiscal 2024, respectively. See Note 11- Pension Plans, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We maintain self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers’ compensation exposures. Other long-term liabilities include known claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims not otherwise covered by insurance based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience. Since the timing and amount of claim payments vary significantly, we are not able to reasonably estimate future payments for specific periods and therefore such payments have not been included in the table above. Standby letters of credit aggregating $2.7 million have been issued in connection with our self-insurance programs. These standby letters of credit expire through March 2026 and are expected to be renewed.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on management’s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results. We believe that the critical accounting policies described in the following paragraphs comprise the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For these policies, we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as estimated and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. See Note 1- Significant Accounting Policies, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete description of our significant accounting policies.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied. Our written sales terms do not allow a right of return except in rare instances. We offer various sales incentive arrangements to our customers that require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets. Sales incentives are accrued over the period of benefit or expected sales. When the incentive is paid in advance, the aggregate incentive is recorded as a prepaid asset and amortized over the period of benefit. The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors. Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized may vary from accrued amounts. Such differences are recorded once determined and have historically not been significant.

We sell products to a variety of customers and extend credit based on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. Exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer. Our products are typically sold on credit; however smaller direct-store delivery accounts may be sold on a cash on delivery basis. Our credit terms normally require payment within 30 days of delivery and may allow discounts for early payment. We estimate and reserve for credit losses based on our experience with past due accounts, collectability and our analysis of customer data.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

National Beverage Corp. and its representatives may make written or oral statements relating to future events or results relative to our financial, operational and business performance, achievements, objectives and strategies. These statements are “forward-looking” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and include statements contained in this report and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in reports to our stockholders. Certain statements including, without limitation, statements containing the words “believes,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “expects,” “estimates”, ”may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” and similar expressions constitute “forward-looking statements” and involve known and unknown risk, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of our Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: general economic and business conditions, pricing of competitive products, success of new product and flavor introductions, fluctuations in the costs and availability of raw materials and packaging supplies, including effects of potential tariffs, ability to recover cost increases, labor strikes or work stoppages or other interruptions in the employment of labor, continued retailer support for our products, changes in brand image, consumer demand and preferences and our success in creating products geared toward consumers’ tastes, success in implementing business strategies, changes in business strategy or development plans, technology failures or cyberattacks on our technology systems or our effective response to technology failures or cyberattacks on our customers’, suppliers’ or other third parties’ technology systems, government regulations, taxes or fees imposed on the sale of our products, unfavorable weather conditions, changing weather patterns and natural disasters, climate change or legislative or regulatory responses to such change and other factors referenced in this report, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and other reports to our stockholders. We disclaim any obligation to update any such factors or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward- looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Commodities

We purchase various raw materials, including aluminum cans, plastic bottles, high fructose corn syrup, corrugated packaging and juice concentrates, the prices of which fluctuate based on commodity market conditions. Our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. At times, we manage our exposure to this risk through the use of supplier pricing agreements that enable us to establish all, or a portion of, the purchase prices for certain raw materials. Additionally, we use derivative financial instruments to partially mitigate our exposure to changes in certain raw material costs.

Interest Rates

At May 3, 2025, we had no outstanding borrowings. We are subject to interest rate risk related to our investment in highly liquid short-duration investment securities and money-market funds which are considered cash equivalents. These investments are managed within the guidelines of our investment policy. Our policy requires investments to be investment grade, within the primary objective of minimizing the risk of principal loss. In addition, our policy limits the amount of exposure to any one issue.

NATIONAL BEVERAGE CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

National Beverage Corp. develops, produces, markets and sells a distinctive portfolio of sparkling waters, juices, energy drinks and carbonated soft drinks primarily in the United States. Incorporated in Delaware in 1985, National Beverage Corp. is a holding company for various operating subsidiaries. When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Company” and “National Beverage” mean National Beverage Corp. and its subsidiaries.

1.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) and rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of National Beverage Corp. and all subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated. The Company’s fiscal year ends the Saturday closest to 
 April 30 
and, as a result, an additional week is added every 
five
 or 
six
 years. The fiscal year ended 
 May 3, 2025 (
“Fiscal 
2025”
) consisted of 
53
 weeks. The fiscal years ended 
 April 27, 2024 (
“Fiscal 
2024”
) and 
 April 29, 2023 (
“Fiscal 
2023”
) both consisted of 
52
 weeks.

Segment Reporting 

The Company has 
one
 reportable segment for purposes of presenting financial information and evaluating performance. See Note 
13
- Segment Information, for additional information.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on management’s knowledge of current events and anticipated future actions, actual results 
 may 
vary from reported amounts.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value due to the relatively short maturity of the respective instruments. As of 
 May 3, 2025 
and 
 April 27, 2024, 
cash and cash equivalents included money-market instruments of $
109.1
 million and $
240.9
 million, respectively. These financial instruments are Level 
1
 as defined by the fair value hierarchy since they are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Derivative financial instruments which are used to partially mitigate the Company’s exposure to changes in certain raw material costs are recorded at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are 
not
 used for trading or speculative purposes. Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is managed by requiring high credit standards for counterparties and frequent cash settlements. The estimated fair values of derivative financial instruments are calculated based on market rates to settle the instruments. See Note 
7
-Derivative Financial Instruments.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash and highly liquid securities (consisting primarily of bank deposits and short-term government money-market investments) with original maturities of 
three
 months or less from the date of purchase.

Trade Receivables, Net

Trade receivables are recorded at net realizable value, which includes an estimated allowance for credit losses. The Company extends credit based on an evaluation of each customer’s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. Exposure to credit losses varies by customer principally due to the financial condition of each customer. The Company continually monitors its exposure to credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated credit losses based on its experience with past due accounts, collectability and its analysis of customer data. Actual future losses from uncollectible accounts could differ from the Company’s estimate.

Changes in the allowance for credit losses were as follows:

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost. Additions, replacements and betterments are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs that do 
not
 extend the useful life of an asset are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 
2
 to 
30
 years for buildings and improvements and 
3
 to 
15
 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any related gain or loss is recognized.

Leases

The Company leases office and warehouse space, machinery and other equipment under noncancelable operating lease agreements. The Company uses the following policies and assumptions to evaluate its leases:

●

Determining a lease: 
The Company assesses contracts at inception to determine whether an arrangement is or includes a lease, which conveys

the Company’s right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Operating lease right-of-use assets and associated liabilities are recognized at the commencement date and initially measured based on the present value of lease payments over the defined lease term.

●

Allocating lease and non-lease components: 
The Company has elected the practical expedient to 
not
 separate lease and non-lease components

for certain classes of underlying assets. The Company has equipment and vehicle lease agreements, which generally have the lease and associated non- lease components accounted for as a single lease component. The Company has real estate lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately where applicable.

●

Calculating the discount rate: 
The Company calculates the discount rate based on the discount rate implicit in the lease, or if the implicit rate

is 
not
 readily determinable from the lease, then the Company calculates an incremental borrowing rate.

●

Recognizing leases: 
The Company does 
not
 recognize leases with an initial contractual term of less than 
12
 months on its consolidated balance sheets.

Lease expense for these short-term leases is expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

●

Rent increases or escalation clauses: 
Certain leases contain scheduled rent increases or escalation clauses, which can be based on the

Consumer Price Index or other rates. The Company assesses each contract individually based on the terms of the agreement.

●

Renewal options and/or purchase options: 
The Company does 
not
 assume renewals in its determination of the lease term unless the

renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured at lease commencement.

●

Residual value guarantees, restrictions or covenants: 
The Company’s lease agreements do 
not
 contain material residual value guarantees, restrictions or covenants.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets at 
 May 3, 2025 
and 
 April 27, 2024 
consisted of non-amortizable acquired trademarks.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

All long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and intangible assets 
not
 subject to amortization, are evaluated for impairment on the basis of undiscounted cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset 
 may 
not
 be recoverable. Goodwill and intangible assets 
not
 subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or sooner if management believes such assets 
 may 
be impaired. An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on discounted future cash flows.

Table of Contents

Insurance Reserves

The Company maintains self-insured and deductible programs for certain liability, medical and workers’ compensation exposures. Accordingly, the Company accrues for known claims and estimated incurred but 
not
 reported claims 
not
 otherwise covered by insurance based on actuarial assumptions and historical claims experience. At 
 May 3, 2025 
and 
 April 27, 2024, 
other liabilities included accruals of $
5.5
 million for estimated non-current risk retention exposures, of which $
3.8
 million and $
4.0
 million, respectively, was covered by insurance at both dates and included as a component of non-current other assets.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied. The Company’s written sales terms do 
not
 allow a right of return except in rare instances. The Company’s products are typically sold on credit; however smaller direct store delivery accounts 
 may 
be sold on a cash on delivery basis. The Company’s credit terms normally require payment within 
30
 days of delivery and 
 may 
allow discounts for early payment. The Company estimates and reserves for credit losses based on the Company’s experience with past due accounts, collectability and its analysis of customer data. Various sales incentive arrangements are offered to the Company’s customers that 
 may 
require customer performance or achievement of certain sales volume targets. Sales incentives are accrued over the period of benefit or expected sales. When an incentive is paid in advance, the aggregate incentive is recorded as a prepaid asset and amortized over the period of benefit. The recognition of these incentives involves the use of judgment related to performance and sales volume estimates that are made based on historical experience and other factors. Sales incentives are accounted for as a reduction of sales and actual amounts ultimately realized 
 may 
vary from accrued amounts. Such differences are recorded once determined and have historically 
not
 been significant.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Shipping and handling costs were $
75.5
 million, $
77.8
 million and $
86.8
 million for Fiscal 
2025,
 Fiscal 
2024
 and Fiscal 
2023,
 respectively. Although the Company’s classification is consistent with many beverage companies, its gross margin 
 may 
not
 be comparable to companies that include shipping and handling costs in cost of sales.

Marketing Costs

The Company utilizes a variety of marketing programs, including cooperative advertising programs with customers, to advertise and promote its products to consumers. Marketing costs are expensed when incurred, except for prepaid advertising and production costs, which are expensed when the advertising takes place. Marketing costs, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, were $
45.3
 million, $
50.0
 million and $
44.1
 million for Fiscal 
2025,
 Fiscal 
2024
 and Fiscal 
2023,
 respectively.

Income Taxes 

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. A valuation allowance would be provided against deferred tax assets if the Company determines it is more likely than 
not
 such assets will 
not
 ultimately be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is calculated in a similar manner, but includes the dilutive effect of stock options amounting to 
78,000
, 
201,000
 and 
261,000
 shares in Fiscal 
2025,
 Fiscal 
2024
 and Fiscal 
2023,
 respectively. The weighted-average number of antidilutive stock options excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share was immaterial for Fiscal 
2025.

DEBT

At 
 May 3, 2025, 
a subsidiary of the Company maintained unsecured revolving credit facilities with banks aggregating $
100
 million (the “Credit Facilities”). The Credit Facilities expire from 
 September 10, 2027 
to 
 May 30, 2028 
and any borrowings would currently bear interest at 
1.15
% above the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“
SOFR
”). There were 
no
 borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facilities at 
 May 3, 2025 
or 
 April 27, 2024. 
At 
 May 3, 2025, 
$
2.7
 million of the Credit Facilities was reserved for standby letters of credit and $
97.3
 million was available for borrowings.

A subsidiary of the Company also maintains an unsecured revolving term loan facility with a national bank aggregating $
50
 million (the “Loan Facility”). There were 
no
 borrowings outstanding under the Loan Facility at 
 May 3, 2025 
or 
 April 27, 2024. 
The Loan Facility expires 
 December 31, 2027 
and borrowings would bear interest at 
1.15
% above the adjusted daily 
SOFR
.

The Credit Facilities and Loan Facility require the subsidiary to maintain certain financial ratios, including debt to net worth and debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreements) and contain other restrictions, 
none
 of which are expected to have a material effect on its operations or financial position. At 
 May 3, 2025, 
the subsidiary was in compliance with all loan covenants.

CAPITAL STOCK AND TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

The Company paid a special cash dividend of $
3.25
 per share on Common Stock aggregating $
304.1
 million on 
 July 24, 2024.

The Company is a party to a management agreement with Corporate Management Advisors, Inc. (CMA), a corporation owned by its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. This agreement was originated in 
1991
 for the efficient use of management of 
two
 public companies at the time.

Under the terms of the agreement, CMA provides, subject to the direction and supervision of the Board of Directors of the Company, (i) senior corporate functions (including supervision of the Company’s financial, legal, executive recruitment, internal audit and information systems departments) as well as the services of a Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and (ii) services in connection with acquisitions, dispositions and financings by the Company, including identifying and profiling acquisition candidates, negotiating and structuring potential transactions and arranging financing for any such transaction. CMA, through its personnel, also provides, to the extent possible, the stimulus and creativity to develop an innovative and dynamic persona for the Company, its products and corporate image. In order to fulfill its obligations under the management agreement, CMA employs numerous individuals, who, acting as a unit, provide management, administrative and creative functions for the Company.

CMA and the Company are joint owners of a corporate aircraft and pursuant to a joint ownership agreement, each party agreed to pay certain expenses associated with the use of the aircraft. During the past 
three
 years, the joint operating costs have averaged approximately $
1.1
 million per year.

The management agreement provides that the Company will pay CMA an annual base fee equal to 
one
 percent of the consolidated net sales of the Company and further provides that the Compensation and Stock Option Committee and the Board of Directors 
 may 
from time-to-time award additional incentive compensation to CMA or its personnel. The Board of Directors on various occasions contemplated incentive compensation to CMA, however, since the inception of this agreement, 
no
 incentive compensation has been paid. The Company incurred management fees to CMA of $
12.0
 million, $
11.9
 million and $
11.7
 million for Fiscal 
2025,
 Fiscal 
2024
 and Fiscal 
2023,
 respectively, which are recorded in general and administrative expenses. At 
 May 3, 2025 
and 
 April 27, 2024, 
accounts payable included amounts due to CMA of $
2.1
 million and $
3.0
 million, respectively.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

From time to time, the Company enters into aluminum swap contracts to partially mitigate its exposure to changes in the cost of aluminum containers. Such financial instruments are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, gains or losses attributable to the effective portion of the cash flow hedge are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) and reclassified into cost of sales in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The following summarizes the gains (losses) recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income and AOCI:

no
 change in the commodity prices, $
6.4
 million of unrealized gain before tax will be reclassified from AOCI and recognized into earnings over the next 
12
 months. The maximum length of time for which the Company hedges its exposure to the variability of future cash flows is less than 
three
 years.

The Company is 
not
 subject to any legally enforceable master netting arrangements and does 
not
 offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments. As of 
 May 3, 2025, 
the fair value of the derivative asset was $
7.4
 million, which was included in 
prepaid and other assets
. The fair value of the derivative liability was $
1.0

accrued liabilities
. As of 
 April 27, 2024, 
the fair value of the derivative asset was $

. Such valuation does 
not
 entail a significant amount of judgment and the inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement are Level

Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense. At 
 May 3, 2025, 
unrecognized tax benefits included accrued interest of $
0.3
 million. During Fiscal 
2025,
 interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions recognized in income tax expense were immaterial.

Annual income tax returns are filed in the United States and in various state and local jurisdictions. A number of years 
 may 
elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which the Company has unrecognized tax benefits, are resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, the Company believes that unrecognized tax benefits reflect the most probable outcome. The Company adjusts these unrecognized tax benefits, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. The resolution of any particular uncertain tax position could require the use of cash and an adjustment to its provision for income taxes in the period of resolution. Federal income tax returns for years subsequent to Fiscal 
2019
 are subject to examination. Generally, the income tax returns for the various state jurisdictions for years subsequent to Fiscal 
2018
 are subject to examination.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company has been named in certain legal proceedings. The Company is vigorously defending all legal proceedings and believes litigation will

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

The Company’s stock-based compensation program is a broad-based program designed to attract and retain personnel while also aligning participants’ interests with the interests of the shareholders.

Table of Contents

The 
1991
 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Plan”) provides for compensatory awards consisting of (i) stock options or stock awards for up to 
9,600,000
 shares of common stock, (ii) stock appreciation rights, dividend equivalents, other stock-based awards in amounts up to 
9,600,000
 shares of common stock and (iii) performance awards consisting of any combination of the above. The Omnibus Plan is designed to provide an incentive to officers and certain other key employees and consultants by making available to them an opportunity to acquire a proprietary interest or to increase such interest in National Beverage. The number of shares or options which 
 may 
be issued under stock-based awards to an individual is limited to 
3,360,000
 during any year. Awards 
 may 
be granted for 
no
 cash consideration or such minimal cash consideration as 
 may 
be required by law. Options generally have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, vest over a 
five
-year period, and expire after 
ten
 years.

The Special Stock Option Plan provides for the issuance of stock options to purchase up to an aggregate of 
3,600,000
 shares of common stock. Options 
 may 
be granted for such consideration as determined by the Board of Directors. The vesting schedule and exercise price of these options are tied to the recipient’s ownership level of common stock, the terms generally allow for the reduction in exercise price upon each vesting period and the options generally expire after 
ten
 years. The Board of Directors has also authorized the issuance of options to purchase up to 
100,000
 shares of common stock to be issued at the direction of the Chairman.

The Key Employee Equity Partnership Program (“KEEP Program”) provides for the granting of stock options to purchase up to 
480,000
 shares of common stock to key employees, consultants, directors and officers. Participants who purchase shares of stock in the open market receive grants of stock options equal to 
50
% of the number of shares purchased, up to a maximum of 
12,000
 shares in any 
two
-year period. Options under the KEEP Program are forfeited in the event of the sale of shares used to acquire such options. Options are granted at an initial exercise price of 
60
% of the purchase price paid for the shares acquired, the exercise price reduces to the par value of the common stock at the end of the 
six
-year vesting period, and the options generally expire after 
ten
 years.

Stock options are accounted for under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the stock option fair value at date of grant. The fair value of stock options is amortized to expense over the vesting period. The Company estimates expected forfeitures based upon historical experience. 
No
 stock options were granted in Fiscal 
2025,
 Fiscal 
2024
 or Fiscal 
2023.
 For stock options granted prior to Fiscal 
2023,
 the expected life of stock options was estimated based on historical experience and the expected volatility was estimated based on historical stock prices for a period consistent with the expected life of stock options. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of stock options.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company operates as a 
single
 operating and reportable segment that encompasses the development, production, marketing and sale of beverages. The Company manages its business on a consolidated basis utilizing vertically integrated production facilities and a centralized supply chain infrastructure.

The Company considers the Chief Executive Officer and its President (assisted by staff) to be its Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM").  The Company’s CEO utilizes his 
50
+ years of diversified business experience to set the Company’s strategic direction, lead product development and instill his operating philosophy throughout the organization. The Company’s President and its key executive team, with their years of beverage experience, focus primarily on executing strategy and supervising the day-to-day operations of the Company. The CODM makes operating decisions, allocates resources and assesses financial performance based primarily upon consolidated operating income and net income as reported in the consolidated statements of income.  The CODM also regularly reviews cost of sales, shipping and handling costs, and marketing costs. These costs represent significant segment expenses and are reported elsewhere in the consolidated financial statements.  Other segment items include other selling and general administrative costs (primarily consisting of compensation-related and other overhead costs), other income (expense), net which includes interest income and interest expense, and provision for income taxes.  Depreciation and amortization expense is reported in the consolidated statements of cash flow.

     The Company generates substantially all its net sales from the United States. All of the Company’s long-lived assets, consisting of property, plant and equipment, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, are located in the United States as of

 May 3, 2025 
and

 April 27, 2024.

The measure of segment assets is reported in the consolidated balance sheets as consolidated total assets. Total segment expenditures for additions to long-lived assets are reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows as purchases of property, plant and equipment and non-cash right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities.

See Note 
1
 - Significant Accounting Policies, for description of accounting policies of the segment.

Opinion on the financial statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of National Beverage Corp. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of May 3, 2025, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year ended May 3, 2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 3, 2025, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended May 3, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of May 3, 2025, based on criteria established in the 2013 
Internal Control
—
Integrated Framework
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated July 2, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion.

Basis for opinion 

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical audit matters

Critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.

 issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended May 3, 2025, and our report dated July 2, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and limitations
 of 
internal control
 over 
financial reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management
’
s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The Company’s Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at May 3, 2025.

Grant Thornton LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements for Fiscal 2025 included in this Annual Report on Form10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued their report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended May 3, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
