Legal Proceedings

From time to time we are engaged in the defense of lawsuits arising out of the ordinary course of our business. We do not believe that the outcome of our current litigation will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.  If one or more legal matters were resolved against us in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of RadNet, Inc. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Overview
We are a national provider of diagnostic imaging services in the United States. As of December 31, 2024, we operated directly or indirectly through joint ventures with hospitals, 398 centers located in Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Texas. Internationally, our subsidiary, The HLH Imaging Group Limited fka Heart & Lung Imaging Limited, provides teleradiology services for remote interpretation of images on behalf of providers within the framework of the United Kingdom's National Health Service. Our operations comprise two segments for financial reporting purposes for this reporting period, Imaging Centers and Digital Health. For further financial information about these segments, see Note 5, Segment Reporting, in the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements included in this report.
Our imaging centers provide physicians with imaging capabilities to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and disorders and may reduce unnecessary invasive procedures, often reducing the cost and amount of care for patients.  
In addition to our imaging business, we established a Digital Health business segment in our 2024 fiscal year, which combines our former Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) business segment with our eRad, Inc. business.  Our digital health segment develops and delivers AI-powered health informatics solutions to drive quality, efficiency, and outcomes in imaging and radiology. The portfolio of software solutions is anchored by eRad, Inc.'s RIS/PACS, informatics designed specifically for outpatient radiology and DeepHealth OS, a cloud-native operating system that helps operate all aspects of the radiology service line from scheduling and patient preparation to technologist workflow to interpretation and referral management. 
Further, we are using AI to develop solutions that employ machine learning to assist radiologists and other clinicians in interpreting images and improving radiologist efficiency and patient care. These AI solutions will initially be focused in the fields of screening for breast, prostate, lung and colon cancers. Our DeepHealth, Inc. subsidiary received FDA clearance for use of its SaigeQ "triage"/workflow product, SaigeDX advanced diagnostic product and Saige-Density breast density assessment software for screening breast mammography, which we have begun to roll out in certain markets as an Enhanced Breast Cancer Detection solution. Our Aidence Holding B.V. subsidiary is developing solutions for interpretation of chest and lung CT scans for lung cancer screening. The Aidence Holding B.V. subsidiary has received the CE marking for these solutions and has existing customers in seven European countries, with its largest concentration in the United Kingdom, and plans to submit an application for FDA clearance to sell in the United States. Our Quantib B.V. subsidiary is primarily focused on interpretation of prostate MRI for widespread prostate cancer screening. Quantib’s prostate MRI post-processing software has both FDA clearances and European CE marking. Our digital health segment provides these solutions to RadNet and to over 400 customers in the United States and Europe.

The following table shows our imaging centers in operation at year end and revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:

Our revenue is derived from a diverse mix of payors, including private payors and commercial insurance companies, managed care capitated payors, and government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid. We believe our payor diversity mitigates our exposure to possible unfavorable reimbursement trends within any one payor class. Our service fee revenue, net of contractual allowances and discounts, implicit price concessions, and revenue under capitation arrangements for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are summarized in the following table (in thousands):

Our revenue is not always consistent across each quarter
. We generally experience the lowest volumes of procedures and the lowest level of revenue during the first quarter of each year. This is primarily the result of two factors. First, our volumes and revenue are typically impacted by winter weather conditions in our northeastern operations. It is common for snowstorms and other inclement weather to result in patient appointment cancellations and, in some cases, imaging center closures. Second, in recent years, we have observed greater participation in high deductible health plans by patients. As these high deductibles reset in January for most of these patients, we have observed that patients utilize medical services less during the first quarter, when securing medical care will result in significant out-of-pocket expenditures.

Acquisitions, Equity Investments and Joint Venture Activity

The following discussion summarizes certain details concerning our acquisition or disposition of centers, our equity investments and our joint venture transactions.  See Note 4, Business Combinations and Related Activity and Note 2,  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements included in this report for further information.

Digital Health Segment
Kheiron Medical Technologies LTD
On October 14, 2024, we acquired a all of the equity interest in Kheiron Medical Technologies LTD (“Kheiron”), which uses deep learning AI to help radiologists detect breast cancer. 
38
 Kheiron’s operations are included in our Digital Health segment for reporting purposes. The transaction was accounted for as the acquisition of a business with a total purchase consideration of approximately $2.3 million, including: i)  cash of $0.4 million, ii) cash holdback of $0.5 million to be issued 18 months after acquisition, (iii) acquisition costs incurred by the seller of $0.4 million and (iv) a settlement of a loan from RadNet of $1.0 million. We recorded $1.2 million in current assets,  $2.7 million of IPR&D in intangible assets, and $1.5 million in current liabilities in connection with this transaction.
In performing the purchase price allocation, we considered, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the Kheiron business. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized as of December 31, 2024, fair value determination is preliminary and subject to change.
Subsidiary activity
Formation of majority owned subsidiaries
Tri Valley Imaging Group, LLC.
 On February 23, 2024, we formed Tri Valley Imaging Group, LLC ("TVIG"), a partnership with Providence Health System - Southern California ("PHS"). The operation offers multi-modality services out of seven locations in Southern California. On March 29, 2024, we contributed the operations of four centers to the enterprise and PHS contributed a business comprising of three centers, including $1.4 million of fixed assets and $6.0 million in goodwill. Simultaneously, PHS purchased from us an additional economic interest in TVIG for cash payment of $9.6 million.  As a result of the transaction, we recognized a gain of $7.9 million to additional paid in capital and retained a 52% controlling economic interest in TVIG and PHS retained a $7.8 million or 48% noncontrolling economic interest in TVIG.
Ventura County Imaging Group.
 On March 31, 2024, Community Memorial Health System purchased an economic interest of Ventura County Imaging Group ("VGIC") for a consideration of $5.1 million. As a result of the transaction, we retained 47.5% controlling economic interest in VGIC.
Los Angeles Imaging Group, LLC. 
On September 1, 2023, we formed our wholly-owned subsidiary, Los Angeles Imaging Group, LLC ("LAIG"). The operation offers multi-modality imaging services out of three locations in Los Angeles, California. We contributed the operations of 3 centers to the subsidiary. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center purchased from us a 35% noncontrolling economic interest in LAIG for a cash payment of $5.9 million. As a result of the transaction, we retain a 65% controlling economic interest in LAIG.
Joint venture investment contribution
Santa Monica Imaging Group, LLC
On April 1, 2017, we formed in conjunction with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center the Santa Monica Imaging Group, LLC ("SMIG"), consisting of two multi-modality imaging centers located in Santa Monica, California with RadNet holding a 40% economic interest and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center holding a 60% economic interest. We account for our share of the venture under the equity method. On January 1, 2019, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center purchased an additional 5% economic interest in SMIG from us and, as a result, our economic interest in SMIG was reduced to 35%.
On September 1, 2023, we contributed an additional multi-modality imaging center and a newly constructed imaging center located in Beverly Hills, California valued at $27.2 million and purchased an additional economic interest in SMIG for cash payment of $11.3 million. Simultaneously, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center contributed five additional multi-modality imaging centers located in Santa Monica, California. As a result of the transaction, our economic interest in SMIG increased to 49%. We recorded a gain of $16.8 million, within gain on contribution of imaging centers into joint venture

in our consolidated statement of operations representing the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the business contributed.
Joint venture investment contributions to Arizona Diagnostic Radiology Group
During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we made additional equity contributions of $1.4 million and $2.4 million, respectively, to Arizona Diagnostic Radiology Group ("ADRG", our joint venture with Dignity Health).
On November 1, 2022 we contributed eight of our imaging centers to ADRG of $12.7 million and recorded a loss of $0.5 million which was calculated as the difference between the transaction price and carrying value of such imaging centers which included equipment and other assets and an allocation of goodwill to such imaging centers.  We recorded $4.5 million of the transaction price as an offset to due to affiliates while the remaining $8.3 million was recorded as investment in joint venture on our balance sheet. We accounted for the transaction as an adjustment to our equity investment for the value of the 
39
assets contributed. To maintain our 49% economic interest in ADRG, we received a distribution from the partnership of $4.5 million to reduce our overall investment to $8.3 million.

Imaging Center Segment
Year Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2023 
We grow our imaging center business through a combination of organic growth as well as acquisitions and joint ventures.  In the discussion below, the "same center" metrics are based on imaging centers that were in operation throughout the period of January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2024.  Excluded amounts relate to imaging centers that were acquired or divested between January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2024.

Our 9.8% increase in same center revenue over the same period last year was driven by increases in fees charged per imaging procedure and an increase in procedures volumes.  Same center total procedure volume grew at an overall rate of 3.2% which was comprised of a 1.7% increase in routine imaging and an 8.1% increase in advanced modality imaging procedures. The increase in revenue was largely attributable to product mix, as advanced imaging was a greater portion of overall procedures. A significant contributor to the change in product mix was the increase in PETHC procedures related to prostate cancer and suspect Alzheimer’s studies, which are included in advanced modality imaging procedures.  
Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased approximately $178.6 million, or 12.2%, from $1.47 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 to $1.64 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to increase in procedures volumes.

Consistent with the higher procedure volumes noted above, our staffing levels were adjusted to support the influx of patients seeking radiology procedures.  Additionally, we are continuing to face inflation in employee wage rates as we compete for talent in a tight labor market, further impacted by the October 2024 increase in California's minimum wage for healthcare workers. 
    Stock-based compensation
Stock-based compensation increased $2.3 million, or 9.3%, to approximately $26.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher fair value of stock awards granted in the first quarter of 2024.

The increase in medical supplies expense was driven by our higher patient volume and product shift towards more advanced imaging modalities. The increase in PETHC procedures related to prostate cancer and suspected Alzheimer studies also raised medical supplies expense due to the requirement for high-cost isotope tracers.

The increase in depreciation expense was due to higher depreciable asset base, mainly driven by our expanded locations.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a non-recurring gain on the contribution of assets into our Santa Monica Imaging Group LLC joint venture. 
Other income for the year ended December 31, 2024 included money market interest income of $31.4 million, partially offset by an impairment of investment in non-marketable securities of $1.2 million and debt restructuring and extinguishment expenses of $11.3 million. Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased approximately $20.6 million, or 190%, to $31.4 million from $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.  The increase is primarily due to higher average cash balance in our money market account for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Lease abandonment charges
We closely monitor patient levels at our imaging centers and occasionally divest or shut down centers to maximize utilization rates. 
During the end of 2024, we experienced lower utilization at seven imaging centers. As a result, we abandoned the leases related to these locations at the end of 2024 and diverted the patients to our other sites in the area. We recorded a charge of approximately $2.5 million in December 2024 related to lease facilities abandonment. The lease abandonment charges include the impairment of associated right-of-use assets of $1.8 million and write off of related leasehold improvements of approximately $0.7 million.
During the end of 2023, we experienced lower utilization at two imaging centers. As a result, we abandoned the leases related to these locations at the end of 2023 and diverted the patients to our other sites in the area. We recorded a charge of approximately $5.1 million in December 2023 related to lease facilities abandonment. The lease abandonment charges include the impairment of associated right-of-use assets of $2.7 million and write off of related leasehold improvements of approximately $2.5 million.

The increase in interest expense was the result in the general increase in term loan debt due to the refinancing of our Barclays credit facility in April 2024, partially offset by lower interest rates compared to the same period in the prior year.
  During the year ended December 31, 2024, interest rates were above the arranged rates in our 2019 Swaps for most of the year and we received $13.1 million in cash payments from our 2019 swap counterparties, which were reported as a component of interest expense. Also, the 2019 Swaps for $100 million of notional value matured in October 2023, and were not in effect in 2024. See the Derivative Instruments section of Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements included in this report and Item 7A —  "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk" below for more details on our derivative transactions.
Non-cash change in fair value of interest rate hedge
In 2020, we determined that the cash flows from the 2019 swaps did not match the cash flows of our Barclays term loan and were therefore ineffective as cash flow hedges.  Since that time, in accordance with accounting guidelines, all changes in fair value are being recognized in other income and expense. 
The fair value of the 2019 swaps as of December 31, 2024 was a net asset of $7.1 million compared to a net asset of $15.1 million December 31, 2023, resulting in a loss $8.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. This change in fair value was driven by market expectations of continued declines in interest rates over the remaining term of the 2019 Swaps.
Equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures

for the year ended December 31, 2024 we recognized equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures of $14.5 million versus $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $8.0 million or 125.2%. The increase was mainly due to the additional contribution made to SMIG in September 2023. SMIG operated at a net income for the December 31, 2024, which positively impacted our equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures during the period. Additionally, the increase was supported by improved earnings from our interest in the Arizona Diagnostic Radiology Group joint venture, reflecting continuing operational improvements and revenue growth.
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests
As of December 31, 2024, our consolidated subsidiaries operated 348 imaging centers of which 100 were not wholly-owned and thus a portion of their operating results were attributable to noncontrolling interests. At December 31, 2023, our consolidated subsidiaries included 321 centers of which 85 were not wholly-owned. As noncontrolling interests only represent a portion of our imaging center business, and excludes our Digital Health segment which generated losses of $21.2 million in 2024, we do not expect changes in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests to correlate with changes in consolidated operating income or pretax income.
for the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $36.0 million versus $27.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $8.8 million.  The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was primarily due to the formation of new majority owned subsidiaries, Los Angeles Imaging Group, LLC, in September 2023 and Tri Valley Imaging Group, LLC in March 2024. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was also impacted by an increase in patient volumes for advanced modalities in 2024 and the closure of two underperforming centers in a majority owned subsidiary, Beach Imaging Group, LLC in 2023.

Overall revenue change was driven by procedure volume growth of 5.7% compared to the same period in the prior year. On a same center basis, the increase in revenue was largely attributable to product mix as advanced radiology procedures of MRI, PET, and CT expanded at combined 7.2% to provide the major portion of the revenue growth.
Operating Expenses

Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased approximately $128.1 million, or 9.6%, from $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023.

* The percent change in contribution of imaging centers into joint venture was not meaningful.
The increase in depreciation expense was the result of our higher depreciable asset base.  For the year ended  December 31, 2023, we recognized a gain on the contribution of assets into our Santa Monica Imaging Group LLC joint venture.  The non-cash expense associated with the change in fair value of our interest rate swaps for the year ended December 31, 2023 related to the expiration of our notional $100 million in 2019 swaps and the shorter term on our remaining $400 million notional 2019 swaps.  The gain associated with the non-cash change in fair value of interest rate swaps during the year ended December 31, 2022 was driven by the significant increase in interest rates experienced during the time period. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2023 included money market interest income of $10.9 million. Other expenses in 2022 included approximately $0.7 million of debt restructuring charges related to the refinancing of our credit facilities with Truist in 2022 and an eRad loss on investments of $2.9 million.
Lease abandonment charges
We closely monitor patient levels at our imaging centers and occasionally divest or shut down centers to maximize utilization rates. During the end of 2023, we experienced lower utilization at two imaging centers. As a result, we abandoned the leases related to these locations at the end of 2023 and diverted the patients to our other sites in the area. We recorded a charge of approximately $5.1 million in December 2023 related to lease facilities abandonment. The lease abandonment charges include the impairment of associated right-of-use assets of $2.7 million and write off of related leasehold improvements of approximately $2.5 million.

The rise in adjusted interest expense is attributable to higher overall loan balances in combination with increased variable interest rates paid on those balances in comparison to the same period in the prior year. During 2022 we refinanced our Truist term loan which added an additional $108.0 million in obligations to our balance sheet in the fourth quarter. Based on recent Federal Reserve interest rate decisions, we expect the effective interest rates on our senior credit facilities, and the related interest expense, to stabilize in the near term. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for more details on our credit facilities.
 To mitigate our future floating rate interest expense exposure, we entered into the 2019 swaps with locked in interest rates for one-month Term SOFR of 1.89% for $100 million of notional value and 1.98% for $400 million of notional value.  We are liable for premium payments to the 2019 swap counterparties if interest rates are below the arranged rates, and receive payments from the 2019 swap counterparties if interest rates exceed the arranged rates.  If interest rates were to theoretically reduce to 0%, our maximum premium payment would be the difference between the two swapped rates and 0% then multiplied by the notional value of the swaps, or $1.89 million per year for the $100 million swap and $8.0 million per year for the $400 million swap.  Payments under the 2019 swaps are settled in cash on a monthly basis. During the year ended December 31, 2023, interest rates were above the arranged rates for most of the year and we received payment of $14.5 million in cash payments from our 2019 swap counterparties, which was reported a component of interest expense. See the Derivative Instruments section of Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes accompanying the consolidated financial statements included in this report and Item 7A —  "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk" below for more details on our derivative transactions.
Non-cash change in fair value of interest rate hedge
In 2020, we determined that the cash flows from the 2019 swaps did not match the cash flows of our Barclays term loan and were therefore ineffective as cash flow hedges.  Since that time, in accordance with accounting guidelines, all changes in fair value are being recognized in other income and expense. 
The fair value of the 2019 swaps as of December 31, 2023 was a net asset of $15.1 million compared to a net asset of $23.3 million December 31, 2022, resulting in a loss of $8.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, which decreased the Company’s tax provision by $2.1 million.  The significant change in fair value was caused by the expiration of the $100 million swap in October 2023 and the shorter remaining term on the $400 million swap, which offset the increase in market interest rates and the steepening of the yield curve.  The one-month Term SOFR rate as of December 31, 2023 was approximately 5.47%, higher than the 4.33% one-month Term SOFR rate at December 31, 2022 and significantly above the 1.98% arranged rate for the $400 million portion of the 2019 swaps.
Equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures

For the year ended December 31, 2023 we recognized equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures of $6.4 million versus $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, a decrease of $4.0 million or 38.1%. The decrease in equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures was due to the formation of Arizona Diagnostic Radiology Group in November 2022, which operated at a net loss in 2023.
48
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests
At December 31, 2023, our consolidated subsidiaries operated 321 imaging centers of which 85 were not wholly-owned and thus a portion of their operating results were attributable to noncontrolling interests. At December 31, 2022, our consolidated subsidiaries included 318 centers of which 81 were not wholly-owned. As noncontrolling interests only represent a portion of our imaging center business, and excludes our 
Digital Health 
which generated losses of $21.2 million in 2023, we do not expect changes in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests to correlate with changes in consolidated operating income or pretax income.
For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of $27.3 million versus $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $4.3 million. The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was primarily due to the formation of a new majority owned subsidiary, Los Angeles Imaging Group, LLC, in September 2023 as described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. We contributed the operations of three centers to Los Angeles Imaging Group, LLC, and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center contributed cash.  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests also improved as a result of our acquisition of various interests in 2022, which were able to operate for full year in 2023.  In October 2022, our consolidated joint venture New Jersey Imaging Network, LLC, acquired the assets of Montclair Radiological associates, P.A. In November 2022 we acquired a 75% controlling interest in the HLH Imaging Group Limited fka Heart & Lung Imaging Limited. Additionally in April 2022 we formed a new majority owned subsidiary, Frederick County Radiology, LLC.  See Note 4, Business Combinations and Related Activity, in the notes accompanying our consolidated financial statements included in this report, for a more detailed discussion of these acquisitions.

49
Revenues for the Digital Health segment increased as a result of core growth in our eRad PICS business, the rollout in 2023 of our Deephealth OS, and continued rollout of our Enhanced Breast Cancer Detection solutions across additional facilities. The increase in operating expenses was primarily related to salary expense as we increased headcount in connection with the commercialization of our initial AI products and higher non-capitalized research and development expenses with respect to our new DeepHealth cloud OS and generative AI. Aside from the effect of increased non-capitalized research and development expenses, our net loss for the segment was consistent with the prior year. We expect that our Digital Health segment will continue to generate net losses over the next several years. 
Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2022 
The increase in revenues for the 
Digital Health
 segment was driven by the launch of new imaging products, including our Enhanced Breast Cancer Detection product which was initially released in 2022 and is being rolled out in certain of our imaging centers.  The increase in operating expenses for the 
Digital Health
 segment was primarily related to salary expense as we increased headcount in connection with the commercialization of our initial AI products.  Our net loss for the segment was consistent with the prior year.  We expect that our 
Digital Health 
segment will continue to generate net losses over the next several years.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We use both GAAP and non-GAAP metrics to measure our financial results. We believe that, in addition to GAAP metrics, non-GAAP metrics such as Adjusted EBITDA assist us in measuring our core operations from period to period.

Adjusted EBITDA

Our Adjusted EBITDA metric removes non-cash and non-recurring charges that occur in the affected period and provides a basis for measuring the Company’s core financial performance against other periods.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted to exclude losses or gains on the disposal of equipment, other income or loss, loss on debt extinguishment, bargain purchase gains, loss on de-consolidation of joint ventures, gain on contribution of imaging centers into joint ventures, and non-cash equity compensation.  Adjusted EBITDA includes equity earnings in unconsolidated operations and subtracts allocations of earnings to non-controlling interests in subsidiaries, and is adjusted for non-cash or one-time events that take place during the period.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used as an analytical indicator by us and the healthcare industry to assess business performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as an indicator of financial performance.  Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with GAAP and is therefore susceptible to varying methods of calculation and this metric, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

The following is a reconciliation of the nearest comparable GAAP financial measure, net income, to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively (in thousands):

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The cash we generate from our core operations enables us to fund ongoing operations, our research and development for new products and technologies including our investment in AI, and acquisition or expansion of imaging centers.  We expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future.  In March 2024, we closed on a public offering of our common stock raising net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions, and expenses, of $230.2 million. Accordingly, we believe that our current sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity during the 12-month period following December 31, 2024, as well as in the long-term.
The following table summarizes key balance sheet data as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and income statement data for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 (in thousands):

We operate in a capital intensive, high fixed-cost industry that requires significant amounts of capital to fund operations. In addition to ongoing operations, we invest in the purchase of imaging facilities, the acquisition of equipment, and the acquisition of technology to fund our growth. If economic or global business conditions slowed, we expect that we will be able to adjust the pace of our investment activities.  
We continually evaluate our cash needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital or seek alternative financing sources to fund the rapid growth of our business, including through draw-downs on existing or new debt facilities or financing funds.
 We expect to fund any future capital requirements primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings, including borrowing from amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities or through new equity or debt issuances.  We and our subsidiaries or affiliates may from time to time, in our sole discretion, purchase, repay, redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt or equity securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise.

Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 included $289.5 million in net income reconciling adjustments offset by a $56.5 million change in assets and liabilities. The $12.2 million increase in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in income from operations.
Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 increased from December 31, 2023 by $31.6 million. Purchases of imaging centers during the period was $43.7 million, a $31.6 million increase from the prior period. Capital expenditures for property and equipment during the period was $188.1 million, a $11.5 million increase from the prior period. 

Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 resulted from a secondary public offering of our common stock and a refinancing of our Barclays credit facility.  In March 2024, we completed a public offering of 5,232,500 shares of our common stock, which included 682,500 shares sold pursuant to an underwriters overallotment option, at a price to the public of $44.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds after underwriting discounts, commissions, and expenses of $218.4 million. In April 2024, we refinanced our Barclays credit facility replacing the prior facility with an $875 million term loan.  After paying off the balance on the prior facility, payment of accrued interest through the closing of the refinance transaction, and payment of transaction fees and expenses, we added approximately $167.9 million in cash to the balance sheet.
Senior Credit Facilities:
We maintain secured credit facilities with Barclays Bank PLC and with Truist Bank.  
On April 18, 2024, we refinanced our Barclays credit facility, replacing the prior facility with an $875.0 million term loan and a $282.0 million revolving credit facility.

The refinance transaction reduced our interest rates on the Barclays term loan and revolving credit facility and extended the maturity date for the term loan to April 18, 2031 and for the revolving credit facility to April 18, 2029.

The new term loan calls for quarterly principal payments of $2.2 million, compared to $1.8 million under the prior credit facility.
Included in our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024 are $992.0 million of total term loan debt (net of unamortized discounts of $13.7 million) displayed below in thousands:

    We have service agreements with various vendors under which they have agreed to be responsible for the maintenance and repair of a majority of our equipment for a fee that is based on the type and age of the equipment. Under these agreements, we are committed to minimum payments of approximately $35.4 million in 2025.

Critical Accounting Policies
The Securities and Exchange Commission defines critical accounting estimates as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company’s financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgment, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. In Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on Form 10-K we discuss our significant accounting policies, including those that do not require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates. The critical areas involving management’s judgments and estimates are described below.
USE OF ESTIMATES - The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions affect various matters, including our reported amounts of assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements; our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements; and our reported amounts of revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods. These estimates involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management’s control. As a result, actual amounts could materially differ from these estimates.

REVENUES – Our revenues generally relate to net patient fees that we receive from various payors and patients themselves under contracts in which our performance obligations are to provide diagnostic services to the patients. Revenues are recorded during the period when our obligations to provide diagnostic services are satisfied. Our performance obligations for diagnostic services are generally satisfied over a period of less than one day. The contractual relationships with patients, in most cases, also involve a third-party payor (Medicare, Medicaid, managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies, including plans offered through the health insurance exchanges) and the transaction prices for the services provided are dependent upon the terms provided by Medicare and Medicaid, or negotiated with managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies. The payment arrangements with third-party payors for the services we provide to the related patients typically specify payments at amounts less than our standard charges and generally provide for payments based upon predetermined rates per diagnostic services or discounted fee-for-service rates. Management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals.
As it relates to the Group (as defined in Note 1 Nature of Business included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements), this service fee revenue includes payments for both the professional medical interpretation revenue recognized by them as well as the payment for all other aspects related to our providing the imaging services, for which we earn management fees. As it relates to other centers, this service fee revenue is earned through providing the use of our diagnostic imaging equipment and the provision of technical services as well as providing administration services such as clerical and administrative personnel, bookkeeping and accounting services, billing and collection, provision of medical and office supplies, secretarial, reception and transcription services, maintenance of medical records, and advertising, marketing and promotional activities.
54
Our revenues are based upon the estimated amounts we expect to be entitled to receive from patients and third-party payors. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care and commercial insurance plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Revenues related to uninsured patients and copayment and deductible amounts for patients who have health care coverage may have discounts applied (uninsured discounts and contractual discounts). We also record estimated implicit price concessions (based primarily on historical collection experience) related to uninsured accounts to record self-pay revenues at the estimated amounts we expect to collect.
Under capitation arrangements with various health plans, we earn a per-enrollee amount each month for making available diagnostic imaging services to all plan enrollees under the capitation arrangement. Revenue under capitation arrangements is recognized in the period in which we are obligated to provide services to plan enrollees under contracts with various health plans.
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE – Substantially all of our accounts receivable are due under fee-for-service contracts from third party payors, such as insurance companies and government-sponsored healthcare programs, or directly from patients. Services are generally provided pursuant to one-year contracts with healthcare providers. We continuously monitor collections from our payors and maintain an allowance for credit losses based upon specific payor collection issues that we have identified and our historical experience.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS – When the qualifications for business combination accounting treatment are met, it requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.
GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLES – Goodwill totaled $710.7 million and $679.5 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.  Indefinite lived intangible assets were $13.0 million as of December 31, 2024 and $9.0 million as of December 31, 2023 and are associated with the value of certain trade name intangibles and IPR&D.  Goodwill, trade name intangibles and IPR&D are recorded as a result of business combinations. When we determine the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized which should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We determined fair values for each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.  
We tested goodwill, trade name and IPR&D for impairment on October 1, 2024. In September 2023, we determined that an IPR&D indefinite-lived intangible asset related to Aidence's Ai Veye Lung Nodule and Veye Clinic would not receive FDA authorizations for sale in the US without a new submission and additional expenditures for rework in the original projected timeline. The additional expenditures, delay and reduction of US sales affected the estimated fair value of the related IPR&D intangible asset and resulted in impairment charges of $3.9 million within

.  Our annual impairment test as of October 1, 2024 noted no other impairment, and we have not identified any indicators of impairment through December 31, 2024.

Item 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

55
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk.
 We generate substantially all of our revenues and incur substantially all of our expenses in United States dollars.  As a  result, our financial results are unlikely to be materially affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets.

We are exposed to foreign exchange risk with respect to revenues and expenses denominated in the Euro, Canadian Dollar, Hungarian Forint and Pound Sterling. We have AI operations in the Netherlands, radiology services in the United Kingdom, and maintain research and development centers in Canada and Hungary. At the present time, we do not have any foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate this risk. At December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 1% decline in the currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar against these currencies, would have resulted in an annual increase of approximately $0.4 million in operating expenses. 
Interest Rate Sensitivity.
 We pay interest on various types of debt instruments to our suppliers and lending institutions. The agreements entail either fixed or variable interest rates.  Instruments which have fixed rates are mainly leases on radiology equipment. Variable rate interest obligations relate primarily to amounts borrowed under our outstanding credit facilities. Accordingly, our interest expense and consequently, our earnings, are affected by changes in short term interest rates. We purchased the 2019 swaps to mitigate interest rate risk on a portion of our outstanding term loan debt, as described below.
 We can elect SOFR or Alternative Base Rate interest rate options on amounts outstanding under the Barclay's term loan.  At December 31, 2024, after giving effect to the $400 million notional amount of our 2019 swaps, we had $470.6 million outstanding subject to a SOFR election on our Barclay's term loan, at an effective rate plus applicable margin of 6.77%. A hypothetical 1% increase in the SOFR rates under the Barclay's credit facility would result in an increase of $4.7 million in annual interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes.
We can elect SOFR or Base Rate interest rate options on amounts outstanding under the Truist credit facility. At December 31, 2024, we had $135.0 million outstanding subject to an adjusted SOFR election on our Trust term loan. At December 31, 2024, our effective SOFR rate plus applicable margin was 5.93%. A hypothetical 1% increase in the adjusted SOFR rates under the Truist credit facility would result in an increase of approximately $1.4 million in annual interest expense and a corresponding decrease in income before taxes.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of RadNet, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of RadNet, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
58
Valuation of Accounts Receivable
Description of 
the Matter
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s accounts receivable was $185.8 million. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, substantially all of accounts receivable is due under fee-for-service contracts from third-party payors, such as insurance companies and government-sponsored healthcare programs, or directly from patients. The valuation of accounts receivable is determined based upon the estimated amounts the Company expects to be entitled to receive from patients and third-party payors. Estimates of contractual allowances and implicit price concessions associated with third-party payors and any amounts due directly from patients are based upon historical collection experience from such payors. The contractual allowance estimation process is periodically reviewed to consider and incorporate updates to the laws and regulations, and contractual terms resulting from contract negotiations and renewals. The estimated implicit price concessions (based primarily on historical collection experience) are related to amounts due directly from patients to record accounts receivable at the estimated amounts the Company expects to collect.
Auditing management’s estimates of contractual allowances and implicit price concessions was complex and judgmental due to the significant data inputs and subjective assumptions utilized in determining related amounts.
How We 
Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the risks of material misstatement relating to the valuation of accounts receivable. This included testing controls related to management’s review of the significant assumptions and inputs used in the determination of the estimated amount that would be collected for services rendered during the period. We also tested controls over the current and historical data used by management in determining this estimate, including the completeness and accuracy of the data.
To test the estimated contractual allowances and implicit price concessions, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies and evaluating the significant assumptions discussed above and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its estimates. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates as a source of potential corroborative or contrary evidence.

RADNET, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 NOTE 1 – 
NATURE OF BUSINESS

We are a national provider of freestanding, fixed-site outpatient diagnostic imaging services in the United States. At December 31, 2024, we operated directly or indirectly through joint ventures with hospitals, 
398
 centers located in Arizona, California, Delaware, Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Texas. Our centers provide physicians with imaging capabilities to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and disorders. Our services include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), nuclear medicine, mammography, ultrasound, diagnostic radiology (X-ray), fluoroscopy and other related procedures. The vast majority of our centers offer multi-modality imaging services. Our multi-modality strategy diversifies revenue streams, reduces exposure to reimbursement changes and provides patients and referring physicians one location to serve the needs of multiple procedures.  In addition to our center operations, we have certain other subsidiaries that develop Artificial Intelligence ("AI") products and solutions that are designed to enhance interpretation of radiographic images. Our operations comprise 
two
 segments for financial reporting purposes for this reporting period, Imaging Centers and Digital Health. For further financial information about these segments, see Note 5, Segment Reporting.
 In the first quarter of 2024, we revised our reportable segments to combine our eRad, Inc. ("eRad") business, which was previously included in the Imaging Center segment, with our former AI segment to form a new Digital Health reportable segment. Prior period amounts were adjusted retrospectively to reflect the change in reportable segments. For further financial information about these segments, see Note 5, Segment Reporting. 
In March 2024, we closed on a public offering of 
5,232,500
 shares of our common stock, including 
682,500
 shares sold pursuant to the exercise of an underwriter's overallotment option, at a price to the public of $
44.00
 per share. The gross proceeds as a result of this public offering were $
230.2
 million before underwriting discounts, commissions, and costs totaling $
11.8
 million.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of RadNet, Inc. as well as its subsidiaries in which RadNet has a controlling financial interest. The consolidated financial statements also include certain variable interest entities in which we are the primary beneficiary (as described in more detail below). All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. All of these affiliated entities are referred to collectively as “RadNet”, “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company” in this report.
Accounting regulations stipulate that generally any entity with a) insufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by any parties, or b) equity holders that, as a group, lack the characteristics which evidence a controlling financial interest, is considered a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). We consolidate all VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary and in which we have a variable interest. We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE through a qualitative analysis that identifies which variable interest holder has the controlling financial interest in the VIE. The variable interest holder who has both of the following has the controlling financial interest and is the primary beneficiary: (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In performing our analysis, we consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including: the design and activities of the VIE, the terms of the contracts the VIE has entered into, the nature of the VIE’s variable interests issued and how they were negotiated with or marketed to potential investors, and which parties participated significantly in the design or redesign of the entity.
VIEs that we consolidate as the primary beneficiary include professional corporations that are owned or controlled by individuals within our senior management and provide professional medical services for centers in Arizona, California, Delaware, [Florida], Maryland, New Jersey, Texas, and New York. These VIEs are collectively referred to as the “Consolidated Medical Group".  RadNet provides non-medical, technical and administrative services to the Consolidated Medical Group for which it receives a management fee, pursuant to the related management agreements. Through the management agreements we have exclusive authority over all non-medical decision making related to the ongoing business operations and we determine the annual budget. The Consolidated Medical Group has insignificant operating assets and liabilities, and de minimis equity.  Substantially all cash flows of the Consolidated Medical Group after expenses, including professional salaries, are transferred to us. We consolidate the revenue and expenses, assets and liabilities of the Consolidated Medical Group.  The creditors of the Consolidated Medical Group do not have recourse to our general credit and there are no other arrangements that could expose us to losses on behalf of the Consolidated Medical Group. However, RadNet may be required to provide financial support to cover any operating expenses in excess of operating revenues.

205.6
 million, and $
189.1

 million, $
205.6
 million, and $
189.1

 million, $
849.4
 million, and $
786.5
 million of total billed net service fee revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, for management services provided to the Consolidated Medical Group relating primarily to the technical portion of billed revenue.

In our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we have included approximately $
103.0
 million and $
94.1
 million, respectively, of accounts receivable and approximately $
22.7
 million and $
16.7
 million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to the Consolidated Medical Group, respectively. The cash flows of the Consolidated Medical Group are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
At all of our centers not serviced by the Consolidated Medical Group we have entered into long-term contracts with medical groups to provide professional services at those centers, including supervision and interpretation of diagnostic imaging procedures. The medical groups maintain full control over the physicians they employ. Through our management agreements, we make available to the medical groups the imaging centers, including all furniture, fixtures and medical equipment therein.  The medical groups are compensated for their services from the professional component of the global net service fee revenue and after deducting management service fees paid to us, we have no economic controlling interest in these medical groups. As such, the financial results of these groups are not consolidated in our financial statements.
NOTE 2 - 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION – The operating activities of subsidiaries are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements (“financial statements”) from the date of acquisition. Investments in companies in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for by the equity method. All intercompany transactions and balances, with our consolidated entities and the unsettled amount of intercompany transactions with our equity method investees, have been eliminated in consolidation. As stated in Note 1 above, the Consolidated Medical Group consists of VIEs and we consolidate the operating activities and balance sheets of each.
USE OF ESTIMATES - The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates and assumptions affect various matters, including our reported amounts of assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements; our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements; and our reported amounts of revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations during the reporting periods. These estimates involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management’s control. As a result, actual amounts could materially differ from these estimates.

REVENUES – Our revenues generally relate to net patient fees received from various payors and patients themselves under contracts in which our performance obligations are to provide diagnostic services to the patients. Revenues are recorded during the period when our obligations to provide diagnostic services are satisfied. Our performance obligations for diagnostic services are generally satisfied over a period of less than one day. The contractual relationships with patients, in most cases, also involve a third-party payor (
e.g., 
Medicare, Medicaid, managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies, including plans offered through the health insurance exchanges) and the fees for the services provided are dependent upon the terms provided by Medicare and Medicaid, or negotiated with managed care health plans and commercial insurance companies. The payment arrangements with third-party payors for the services we provide to the related patients typically specify payments at amounts less than our standard charges and generally provide for payments based upon predetermined rates per diagnostic services or discounted fee-for-service rates. Management continually reviews the contractual estimation process to consider and incorporate updates to laws and regulations and the frequent changes in managed care contractual terms resulting from contract renegotiations and renewals.
As it relates to the Consolidated Medical Group, this service fee revenue includes payments for both the professional medical interpretation revenue recognized by the Consolidated Medical Group as well as the payment for all other aspects related to our providing the imaging services, for which we earn management fees. As it relates to other centers, this service fee revenue is earned through providing the use of our diagnostic imaging equipment and the provision of technical services as well as providing administration services such as clerical and administrative personnel, bookkeeping and accounting services, billing 
67
and collection, provision of medical and office supplies, secretarial, reception and transcription services, maintenance of medical records, and advertising, marketing and promotional activities.
Our service fee revenues are based upon the estimated amounts we expect to be entitled to receive from patients and third-party payors. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care and commercial insurance plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Revenues related to uninsured patients and co-payment and deductible amounts for patients who have health care coverage may have discounts applied (uninsured discounts and contractual discounts). We also record estimated implicit price concessions (based primarily on historical collection experience) related to uninsured accounts to record self-pay revenues at the estimated amounts we expect to collect.
Under capitation arrangements with various health plans, we earn a per-enrollee amount each month for making available diagnostic imaging services to all plan enrollees under the capitation arrangement. Revenue under capitation arrangements is recognized in the period in which we are obligated to provide services to plan enrollees under contracts with various health plans.
Our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 are presented in the table below. Our patient service revenue is displayed as the estimated service fee, broken down by classification of insurance coverage type, along with revenue generated from our management services and other sources such as software and AI..

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE – Substantially all of our accounts receivable are due under fee-for-service contracts from third party payors, such as insurance companies and government-sponsored healthcare programs, or directly from patients. Services are generally provided pursuant to one-year contracts with healthcare providers. We continuously monitor collections from our payors and maintain an allowance for credit losses based upon specific payor collection issues that we have identified and our historical experience.
We have entered into factoring agreements with various institutions and sold certain accounts receivable under non-recourse agreements in exchange for notes receivables from the buyers. These transactions are accounted for as a reduction in accounts receivable as the agreements transfer effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyers. Proceeds on notes receivables are reflected as operating activities on our statement of cash flows and on our balance sheet as prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and deposits and other for the long-term portion.
   Amounts remaining to be collected on these agreements were $
4.2
 million and $
14.3
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  We do not utilize factoring arrangements as an integral part of our financing for working capital and assess the party's ability to pay upfront at the inception of the notes receivable and subsequently by reviewing their financial statements annually and reassessing any insolvency risk on a periodic basis.

SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION – We have developed and sell Picture Archiving Communications Systems (“PACS”) and related services. The PACS sales are made primarily through our sales force and generally include hardware, software, installation, training and first-year warranty support. Hardware, which is not unique or special purpose, is purchased from a third-party and resold to customers with a small mark-up.

We have determined that our core software products, such as PACS, are essential to most of our arrangements as hardware, software and related services are sold as an integrated package.  Revenue is recognized when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring a promised good or service to a customer.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we recorded approximately $
27.8
 million, $
20.2
 million, and $
13.2
 million, respectively, in revenue related to our software business which is included in service fee revenue in our consolidated statements of operations. At December 31, 2024 we had deferred revenue of approximately $
1.2
 million associated with these sales which we expect to recognize into revenue over the next 
12
 months.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS – When we develop our own software and artificial intelligence solutions we capitalize and amortize those costs over their useful life of 
1
 to 
12
 years. Costs related to the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software intended for resale to our customers are expensed as incurred.
CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKS – Financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk are primarily cash equivalents and accounts receivable. We have placed our cash and cash equivalents with one major financial institution. The cash in the financial institution is in excess of the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. Substantially all of our accounts receivable are due under fee-for-service contracts from third party payors, such as insurance companies and government-sponsored healthcare programs, or directly from patients. We continuously monitor collections and maintain an allowance for credit losses based upon our historical collection experience. In addition, we have notes receivable stemming from our factoring of accounts receivable as stated above.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS – We consider all highly liquid investments that mature in three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates the fair market value.

DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS – Costs of financing are deferred and amortized using the effective interest rate method.  Deferred financing costs are related to our revolving credit facilities.
 Deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, were $
2.3
 million and $
1.6
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  See Note 8, Credit Facilities and 
Notes Payable for more information on our revolving lines of credit.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT – Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are provided using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 
3
 to 
15
 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized at the lesser of the lease term or their estimated useful lives, which range from 
3
 to 
15
 years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS – When the qualifications for business combination accounting treatment are met, it requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.

69
GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLES
 – Goodwill totaled $
710.7
 million and $
679.5
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Indefinite lived intangible assets were $
13.0
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
9.0
 million at 2023 and are associated with the value of certain trade name intangibles and in process research and development ("IPR&D"). 
Goodwill, trade name intangibles and IPR&D are recorded as a result of business combinations. If we determine that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge equal to such excess, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit, is recognized. We determine fair values for each of the reporting units using the market approach, when available and appropriate, or the income approach, or a combination of both. We assess the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation. If multiple valuation methodologies are used, the results are weighted appropriately.

We tested goodwill, trade name and IPR&D for impairment on October 1, 2024.  In September 2023, we determined that an IPR&D indefinite-lived intangible asset related to Aidence's Ai Veye Lung Nodule and Veye Clinic would not receive FDA authorizations for sale in the US without a new submission and additional expenditures for rework in the original projected timeline. The additional expenditures, delay and reduction of US sales affected the estimated fair value of the related IPR&D intangible asset and resulted in impairment charges of $
3.9
 million within 
Cost of operations
 in our 
Consolidated Statements of Operations
. The estimated fair value of the IPR&D intangible asset was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach, which estimates the present value of the free cash flows associated with the asset and tax amortization benefit to arrive at the fair value of the asset. Our annual impairment test as of October 1, 2024 noted no other impairment, and we have not identified any indicators of impairment through December 31, 2024.  
LONG-LIVED ASSETS – We evaluate our long-lived assets (property and equipment) and intangibles, other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, for impairment when events or changes indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Accounting standards require that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a long-lived asset or definite-lived intangible is less than the carrying value of that asset, an asset impairment charge must be recognized. The amount of the impairment charge is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value, which generally represents the discounted future cash flows from that asset or in the case of assets we expect to sell, at fair value less costs to sell.  For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recorded lease abandonment of $
0.7
 million and $
2.5
 million, respectively pertaining to leasehold improvements at facilities that we shut down. See the Leases discussion below for more information.  Other than this, we determined that there were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated our long-lived assets were impaired during any periods presented.

INCOME TAXES – Income tax expense is computed using an asset and liability method and using expected annual effective tax rates. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences in the financial reporting bases and the income tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefit that, based on available evidence, is not expected to be realized. When it appears more likely than not that deferred taxes will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax asset to its estimated realizable value. For net deferred tax assets we consider estimates of future taxable income in determining whether our net deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. See Note 10, Income Taxes, for more information.
LEASES - We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, current operating lease liabilities, and long term operating lease liability in our consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. We include options to extend a lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For a contract in which we are a lessee that contains fixed payments for both lease and non-lease components, we have elected to account for the components as a single lease component, as permitted. 
ROU assets are tested for impairment if circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. No events have occurred such as fire, flood, or other acts which have impaired the integrity of our ROU assets as of December 31, 2024. Our facility leases require us to maintain insurance policies which would cover major damage to our facilities. We maintain business interruption insurance to cover loss of business due to a facility becoming non-operational under certain circumstances. Our equipment leases are covered by warranty and service contracts which cover repairs and provide regular maintenance to keep the equipment in functioning order.
We closely monitor patient levels at our imaging centers and occasionally divest or shut down centers to maximize utilization rates. We may abandon low utilization leases and divert the patients to nearby centers. During the years ended 2024 
70
and 2023, we experienced lower utilization at various imaging centers which resulted in the closure of these locations and the recognition of lease abandonment charges of approximately $
2.5
 million and $
5.1
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively in our Imaging Center segment. Of these amounts, $
1.8
 million and $
2.7
 million were related to right-of-use assets impairment and $
0.7
 million and $
2.5
 million were related to the write-off of leasehold improvements for the years ending December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
UNINSURED RISKS – We maintain a high-deductible workers’ compensation insurance policy.
 We have recorded liabilities of $
5.6
 million and $
3.4
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for the estimated future cash obligations associated with the unpaid portion of the workers compensation claims incurred.

We and our affiliated physicians carry an annual medical malpractice insurance policy that protects us for claims that are filed during the policy year and that fall within policy limits.
 The policy has a deductible which is $
10,000
 per incidence for all years covered by this report.

In order to eliminate the exposure for claims not reported during the regular malpractice policy period, we have purchased a medical malpractice claims made tail policy, which provides coverage for any claims reported in the event that our medical malpractice policy expires. As of December 31, 2024, this policy remained in effect.

We have entered into an arrangement with Blue Shield to administer and process claims under a self-insured plan that provides health insurance coverage for our employees and dependents.
 We have recorded liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 of $
7.8
 million and $
7.2
 million, respectively, for the estimated future cash obligations associated with the unpaid portion of the medical and dental claims incurred by our participants. Additionally, we entered into an agreement with Blue Shield for a stop loss policy that provides coverage for any claims that exceed $
250,000
 up to a maximum of $
1.0
 million in order for us to limit our exposure for unusual or catastrophic claims. 
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN – We adopted a profit-sharing/savings plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code that covers substantially all non-professional employees. Eligible employees may contribute on a tax-deferred basis a percentage of compensation, up to the maximum allowable under tax law. Employee contributions vest immediately.
 We can elect to provide a matching contribution in the amount to a maximum of 
1.0
% per 
4.0
% of employee contributions.  We contributed $
3.6
 million and $
3.3
 million in matching for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

EQUITY BASED COMPENSATION – We have 
one
 long-term incentive plan that we adopted in 2006 and which we  amended and restated at various points in time: first on April 20, 2015, second on March 9, 2017, third on April 15, 2021 and currently as of April 27, 2023 (the “Restated Plan”). The Restated Plan was most recently approved by our stockholders at our annual stockholders meeting on June 7, 2023. We have reserved 
20,100,000
 shares of common stock for issuance under the Restated Plan which can be issued in the form of incentive and/or nonstatutory stock options, restricted and/or unrestricted stock, stock units, and stock appreciation rights.  Terms and conditions of awards can be direct grants or based on achieving a performance metric. We evaluate performance-based awards to determine if it is probable that the vesting conditions will be met. We also consider probability of achievement of performance conditions when determining expense recognition. For the awards where vesting is probable, equity-based compensation is recognized over the related vesting period. Stock options generally vest over 
3
 years to 
five years
 and expire 
5
 years to 
ten years
 from date of grant.  We determine the compensation expense for each stock option award using the Black Scholes, or similar, valuation model.  Those models require that our management make certain estimates concerning risk free interest rates and volatility in the trading price of our common stock. The compensation expense recognized for all equity-based awards is recognized over the awards’ service periods. Equity-based compensation is classified in operating expenses within the same line item as the majority of the cash compensation paid to employees.  In connection with our acquisition of DeepHealth Inc. on June 1, 2020, we assumed the DeepHealth, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, including outstanding options awards that can be exercised for our common stock.  No additional awards will be granted under the DeepHealth, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan.  See Note 11, Stock-Based Compensation, for more information.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION – For our operations in Canada, Europe and the United Kingdom, the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate at the balance sheet dates. Revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates prevailing during the reporting period. Any translation adjustments resulting from this process are shown separately as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. Gains and losses related to the foreign currency portion of international transactions are included in the determination of net income.

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) – Accounting guidance

establishes rules for reporting and displaying other comprehensive income (loss) ("OCI") and its components. Our foreign currency translation adjustments and the amortization of balances associated with derivatives previously classified as cash flow hedges are included in OCI. The components of OCI for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 are included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.
INTEREST ON SECURITIES - We recognized income from interest on securities of approximately $
31.4
 million and $
10.9
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This income is recorded within 
Other non-operating income
 in our 
Consolidated Statements of Operations
.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES - We are party to various legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business. With respect to these matters, we evaluate the developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Based on current information, we do not believe that reasonably possible or probable losses associated with pending legal proceedings would either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statements. However, the outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could be materially adversely affected.
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
2019 swaps
: 
In the second quarter of 2019, we entered into 
four
 forward interest rate agreements ("2019 swaps").  The 2019 swaps have total notional amounts of $
500,000,000
, consisting of 
two
 agreements of $
50,000,000
 each and 
two
 agreements of  $
200,000,000
 each.   
The 2019 swaps will secure a constant interest rate associated with portions of our variable rate bank debt and have an effective date of October 13, 2020. They matured in October 2023 for the two smaller notional and will mature in October 2025 for the two larger notional.
 Under these arrangements, we arranged the 2019 swaps with locked in 1 month Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") rates at 
1.89
% for the $
100,000,000
 notional and at 
1.98
% for the $
400,000,000
 notional. In October of 2023, the 
two
 agreements of $
50,000,000
 each matured and the remaining 2019 swaps have a total notional amount of $
400,000,000
 as of December 31, 2024. 
As of the effective date, we are liable for premium payments if interest rates decline below arranged rates but receive interest payments if rates remain above the arranged rates.
At inception, we designated our 2019 Swaps as cash flow hedges of floating-rate borrowings. In accordance with accounting guidance, derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments are reported at fair value. The gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedge (i.e. change in fair value) is reported as a component of other accumulated comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of equity.
 The remaining gain or loss, if any, is recognized currently in earnings.  The cash flows for both our $
400,000,000
 notional interest rate swap contract locked in at 
1.98
% due October 2025 and our $
100,000,000
 notional interest rate swap contract locked in at 
1.89
% did not match the cash flows for our Barclays term loans and so we determined that they were not currently effective as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, all changes in their fair value after April 1, 2020 for the $
400,000,000
 notional and after July 1, 2020 for the $
100,000,000
 notional was recognized in earnings. As of July 1, 2020, the total change in fair value relating to swaps included in other comprehensive income was approximately $
24.4
 million, net of taxes.  This amount will be amortized to interest expense through October 2023 at approximately $
0.4
 million per month and continuing at approximately $
0.3
 million per month through October 2025.

Contingent Consideration
: 
Aidence Holding B.V.  
On January 20, 2022, we completed our acquisition of all the equity interests of Aidence Holding B.V. ("Aidence"), an artificial intelligence enterprise centered on lung cancer screening.  As part of the purchase agreement, we agreed to pay up to $
10.0
 million consideration upon the completion of 
two
 identified milestones in RadNet common shares or cash at our election. The fair value is based on the yield rate of S&P B-rated corporate bonds and the probability of meeting the milestones which were tied to FDA authorizations of artificial intelligence screening solutions. In September 2023, we determined that the milestones could not be achieved under the contractual terms of the stock purchase agreement because the original submissions of artificial intelligence screening solutions did not receive regulatory clearance. A new submission would be required; and therefore, the probability of the milestones being achieved became zero. Accordingly, we recognized a gain of $
7.2
 million in 2023 representing the change in fair value of contingent consideration within 
Cost of operations 
in our
 Consolidated Statements of Operations
. In addition, there was a general holdback of $
4.0
 million for any indemnification claims, which was settled on April 30, 2023 by the issuance of 
144,227
 shares of our common stock.
Quantib B.V. 
On January 20, 2022, we completed our acquisition of all the equity interests of Quantib B.V. ("Quantib"), an artificial intelligence enterprise centered on prostate cancer screening.  As part of the purchase agreement, we agreed to issue 
18
 months after acquisition, 
113,303
 shares of our common stock with an initial fair value at the date of close of $
3.0
 million subject to adjustment for any indemnification claims. In addition, there is a general holdback of $
1.6
 million to be 
73
issued in cash subject to adjustment for any indemnification claims. On July 7, 2023, we settled the stock holdback contingent liabilities by issuing 
113,303
 shares of our common stock at an ascribed value of $
3.5
 million and also settled the general holdback for $
1.6
 million in cash.
Montclair. 
On October 1, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Montclair Radiological Associates ("Montclair"). As part of the purchase agreement, we recorded $
1.2
 million in contingent consideration which was based on the anticipated achievement of specific EBITDA targets within a defined time frame. In June 2023, we determined that the contingent consideration thresholds were not achieved and, as such, we recognized a gain of $
1.2
 million representing the change in fair value of the contingent consideration within 
Cost of operations 
in our
 Consolidated Statements of Operations
.
The HLH Imaging Group Limited fka Heart and Lung Imaging Limited. 
On November 1, 2022, we completed our acquisition of 
75
% of the equity interests of Heart & Lung Imaging Limited. The purchase included $
10.2
 million in contingent milestone consideration and a cash holdback of $
0.6
 million to be issued 
24
 months after acquisition subject to adjustment for any indemnification claims.  
The milestone contingencies had a value of approximately $
0
 and $
6.2
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.   The contingent consideration is determined by the achievement of a specific number of physician reads. On September 20, 2023, we settled a milestone contingent liability by issuing 
56,600
 shares of our common stock at an ascribed value of $
1.6
 million and cash of $
1.8
 million. On December 12, 2023, we settled a milestone contingent liability by issuing 
64,569
 shares of our common stock at an ascribed value of $
2.3
 million and cash of $
2.1
 million. On March 27, 2024, we partially settled a milestone contingent liability by issuing 
95,019
 shares of our common stock at an ascribed value of $
4.6
 million. On April 1, 2024, we settled the remaining milestone contingent liability in cash of $
3.6
 million. On November 6, 2024, we settled the remaining holdback in cash of $
0.6
 million. We recognized a loss of $
1.1
 million and $
2.5
 million for the year ended  December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing the change in fair value of the contingent consideration within

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS – Assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements are required to be disclosed within a fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of inputs used to determine fair value. Accordingly, assets and liabilities carried at, or permitted to be carried at, fair value are classified within the fair value hierarchy in one of the following categories based on the lowest level input that is significant to a fair value measurement:

Level 1—Fair value is determined by using unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

Level 2—Fair value is determined by using inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable. Inputs can include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in inactive markets. Related inputs can also include those used in valuation or other pricing models such as interest rates and yield curves that can be corroborated by observable market data.

Level 3—Fair value is determined by using inputs that are unobservable and not corroborated by market data. Use of these inputs involves significant and subjective judgment.
Derivatives:
The table below summarizes the estimated fair values of certain of our financial assets that are subject to fair value measurements, and the classification of these assets in our consolidated balance sheets, as follows (in thousands):

The estimated fair value of these contracts was determined using Level 2 inputs. More specifically, the fair value was determined by calculating the value of the difference between the fixed interest rate of the interest rate swaps and the counterparty’s forward SOFR curve in 2024 and 2023. respectively. The forward SOFR curve and forward LIBOR curve are readily available in the public markets or can be derived from information available in the public markets.

no
 aggregate principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The estimated fair values of our long-term debt, which is discussed in Note 8, was determined using Level 2 inputs for the Barclays and Truist term loans. Level 2 inputs primarily relate to comparable market prices.

We consider the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, other current assets, and current liabilities to approximate their fair value because of the relatively short period of time between the origination of these instruments and their expected realization or payment. Additionally, we consider the carrying amount of our and other notes payable to approximate their fair value because the weighted average interest rate used to formulate the carrying amounts approximates current market rates.

INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES- Accounting guidance requires entities to measure equity investments at fair value, with any changes in fair value recognized in net income. If there is no readily determinable fair value, the guidance allows entities the ability to measure investments at cost, adjusted for observable price changes and impairments, with changes recognized in net income.
As of December 31, 2024, we have 
three
 equity investments with an aggregate carry value of $
8.0
 million.  No observable price changes or impairments in our  investments were identified as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, except as disclosed below.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized a $
1.2
 million impairment loss on our investment in Israel-based Medic Vision in our Imaging Center segment. This was driven by the escalating geopolitical tensions in Israel, which adversely affected market conditions, along with a bona fide offer we received for a similar investment. The offer, which was below the carrying value of our investment, provided a reliable indication of the current fair value of our Medic Vision investment. As a result, we determined that the carrying amount of the investment exceeded its fair value, and the impairment loss has been recorded within "Other income
"
 in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURES – We have 
12
 unconsolidated joint ventures that represent partnerships with hospitals, health systems or radiology practices and were formed for the purpose of owning and operating diagnostic imaging 
77
centers.  Professional services at the joint venture diagnostic imaging centers are performed by contracted radiology practices or a radiology practice that participates in the joint venture.  Our investment in these joint ventures is accounted for under the equity method, as we do not have a controlling financial interest in such ventures. We evaluate our investment in joint ventures, including cost in excess of book value (equity method goodwill) for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. No indicators of impairment existed as of December 31, 2024.

During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we made additional equity contributions of $
1.4
 million and $
2.4
 million, respectively, to Arizona Diagnostic Radiology Group ("ADRG", our joint venture with Dignity Health).
On November 1, 2022, we contributed 
eight
 of our imaging centers to ADRG of $
12.7
 million and recorded a loss of $
0.5
 million, which was calculated as the difference between the sale price and carrying value of such imaging centers which included equipment and other assets and an allocation of goodwill to such imaging centers.  We recorded $
4.5
 million of the sale price as an offset to due to affiliates while the remaining $
8.3
 million was recorded as investment in joint venture on our balance sheet.  We accounted for the transaction as an adjustment to our equity investment for the value of the assets contributed.  To maintain our 
49
% economic interest in ADRG, we received a distribution from the partnership of $
4.5
 million to reduce our overall investment to $
8.3
 million.
Joint venture investment contribution
Santa Monica Imaging Group, LLC. 
Santa Monica Imaging Group, LLC ("SMIG") is a joint venture between RadNet (
49
% economic interest) and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center ("CSMC") (
51
% economic interest), consisting of multiple multi-modality imaging centers in Santa Monica and Beverly Hills, California.
RadNet initially held a 
40
% economic interest, which was later reduced to 
35
% in 2019. In September 2023, RadNet increased its economic to 
35
% by contributing two imaging centers (one newly constructed in Beverly Hills) valued at $
27.2
 million and purchasing an additional interest for cash payment of $
11.3
 million. Simultaneously, CSMC contributed five additional imaging centers in Santa Monica. As a result of this transaction, RadNet recognized a $
16.8
 million gain, recorded under (Gain) on contribution of imaging centers into joint venture in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, reflecting the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the contributed businesses. The related gain on disposal of business was calculated as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of such imaging centers which included equipment, other assets, accrued liabilities, and an allocation of goodwill to such imaging centers.
In determining the fair value of the imaging centers contributed to SMIG, we used an income approach which is considered a level 3 valuation technique. See Fair Value Measurements above for further detail on the valuation hierarchy. Key assumptions used in measuring the fair value are financial forecasts and a discount rate. We also utilized the cash paid for an additional interest in the joint venture to substantiate the fair value of the contributed assets.
NOTE 3 - 
RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) 2023-07 ("ASU 2023-07"),

*Fair Value Determination is Final
Factors contributing to the recognition of the amount of goodwill were primarily based on anticipated strategic and synergistic benefits that are expected to be realized from the acquisition.
Digital Health Segment
Kheiron Medical Technologies LTD
On October 14, 2024, we acquired a all of the equity interest in Kheiron Medical Technologies LTD (“Kheiron”), which uses deep learning AI to help radiologists detect breast cancer. 
 Kheiron’s operations are included in our Digital Health segment for reporting purposes. The transaction was accounted for as the acquisition of a business with a total purchase consideration of approximately $
2.3
 million, including: i)  cash of $
0.4
 million, ii) cash holdback of $
0.5
 million to be issued 
18
 months after acquisition, (iii) acquisition costs incurred by the seller of $
0.4
 million and (iv) a settlement of a loan from RadNet of $
1.0
 million. We recorded $
1.2
 million in current assets,  $
2.7
 million of IPR&D in intangible assets, and $
1.5
 million in current liabilities in connection with this transaction.
In performing the purchase price allocation, we considered, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the Kheiron business. The valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been finalized as of December 31, 2024, fair value determination is preliminary and subject to change.
Subsidiary activity
Formation of majority owned subsidiary and sale of economic interest
Tri Valley Imaging Group, LLC.
 On February 23, 2024, we formed Tri Valley Imaging Group, LLC ("TVIG"), a partnership with Providence Health System - Southern California ("PHS"). The operation offers multi-modality services out of 
seven
 locations in Southern California. On March 29, 2024, we contributed the operations of 
four
 centers to the enterprise and PHS contributed a business comprising 
three
 centers including $
1.4
 million of fixed assets and $
6.0
 million in goodwill. Simultaneously, PHS purchased from us an additional economic interest in TVIG for a cash payment of $
9.6
 million.  As a 
81
result of the transaction, we recognized a gain of $
0.0 million
 to additional paid in capital and retained a 
52
% controlling economic interest in TVIG and PHS retains a $
7.8
 million or 
48
% noncontrolling economic interest in TVIG.
In determining the fair value of the imaging centers contributed to TVIG, we used an income approach which is considered a level 3 valuation technique.  See Fair Value Measurements above for further detail on the valuation hierarchy. Key assumptions used in measuring the fair value are financial forecasts and a discount rate. We also utilized the cash paid for an additional interest in the joint venture to substantiate the fair value of the contributed assets.
Ventura County Imaging Group.
 On March 31, 2024, Community Memorial Health System purchased an economic interest of Ventura County Imaging Group ("VGIC") for a consideration of $
5.1
 million. As a result of the transaction, we retained 
47.5
% controlling economic interest in VGIC.
Los Angeles Imaging Group, LLC. 
On September 1, 2023 we formed a wholly-owned subsidiary, Los Angeles Imaging Group, LLC ("LAIG"). The operation offers multi-modality imaging services out of 
three
 locations in Los Angeles, California. We contributed the operations of 
3
 centers to the subsidiary. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center purchased from us a 
35
% noncontrolling economic interest in LAIG for a cash payment of $
5.9
 million. As a result of the transaction, we retain a 
65
% controlling economic interest in LAIG.

NOTE 5 – 
SEGMENT REPORTING
Our chief operating decision maker ("CODM"), who is also our CEO, evaluates the financial performance of our segments based upon their respective revenue and segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with GAAP. The CODM considers actual to budget and current year actual to prior year actual for revenue and other profit and loss measures on a monthly basis for evaluating performance of each segment and making decisions about allocating capital and other resources to each segment. We do not report balance sheet information by segment since it is not reviewed by our CODM to evaluate segment performance or to make resource allocation decisions.
In the first quarter of 2024, we revised our reportable segments to combine our eRad business, which was included in the Imaging Center segment, with our former AI segment to form a new Digital Health reportable segment. Prior period amounts were adjusted retrospectively to reflect the change in reportable segment. Accordingly, our reportable segments currently are our Imaging Center segment and our Digital Health segment.
Our Imaging Center segment provides physicians with imaging capabilities to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of diseases and disorders. Services include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), nuclear medicine, mammography, ultrasound, diagnostic radiology (X-ray), fluoroscopy and other related procedures. The vast majority of our centers offer multi-modality imaging services, a strategy that diversifies revenue streams, reduces exposure to reimbursement changes and provides patients and referring physicians one location to serve the needs of multiple procedures.
Our Digital Health segment develops and deploys clinical applications to enhance interpretation of medical images and improve patient outcomes with an emphasis on brain, breast, prostate, and pulmonary diagnostics. Included in the segment is our eRad subsidiary, which designs the underlying critical scheduling, data storage and retrieval systems necessary for imaging center operation.
In the normal course of business, our Imaging Center and Digital Health segments enter into transactions with each other. While intersegment transactions are treated like third-party transactions to determine segment performance, the revenues recognized by a segment and expenses incurred by the counterparty are eliminated in consolidation and do not affect consolidated results.
The following tables reflect certain financial data for each reportable segment:

NOTE 8 - 
CREDIT FACILITIES AND NOTES PAYABLE
At December 31, 2024 we had 
two
 principal secured credit facilities consisting of our Barclays credit facility and our Truist credit facility.  Each facility includes a term loan component and a revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facilities.   
Barclays Credit Facility
On April 18, 2024, we entered into a Third Amended and Restated First Lien Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the “Barclays Credit Agreement”), with Barclays Bank Plc and the lenders and financial institutions named therein, which provides for $
875.0
 million of senior secured term loans (the “Barclays Term Loan”) and a $
282.0
 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Barclays Revolving Credit Facility”). Our borrowing under the Barclays Revolving Credit Facility is secured by a lien on all of our assets.  
The proceeds from the April 18, 2024 restatement of the Barclays Credit Agreement were used to refinance the $
678.7
 million of term loans outstanding under the prior credit facility, to pay accrued interest through the date of closing, and to pay fees and expenses associated with the refinancing transaction. Total costs incurred in connection with the restatement amounted to approximately $
19.9
 million segregated as follows: $
11.1
 million recognized as discount and deferred finance cost, $
2.1
 million charged to loss on early extinguishment of debt and $
6.7
 million to related expenses.  Amounts capitalized will be amortized over the remaining terms of the respective credit facilities under the Barclays Credit Agreement.
On November 26, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Barclays Credit Agreement (the “First Amendment”) with the Barclays Bank Plc and the lenders and financial institutions named therein.  Pursuant to the First Amendment, the interest rates on the term loans and revolving credit facility provided under the Restated Credit Agreement have been reduced by 
0.25
%.  Total costs incurred in connection with the first amendment amounted to approximately $
2.4
 million segregated as follows: $
0.6
 million recognized as discount, $
1.8
 million charged to loss on early extinguishment of debt and $
0.1
 million to related expenses.  Amounts capitalized will be amortized over the remaining terms of the respective credit facilities under the Barclays Credit Agreement.

Barclays Term Loan:
88
The Barclays Term Loan provides for interest payments based on a base rate, plus an applicable margin.  
During the periods covered by this report, the base rates, margins and effective interest rates (without giving effect to our 2019 Swaps) were as follows for the periods indicated:

With the recent restatement, we are required to make quarterly principal payments of $
2.2
 million (up from $
1.8
 million under the prior credit agreement).  The Barclays Term Loan will mature on April 18, 2031 unless otherwise accelerated under the terms of the Barclays Credit Agreement.
Barclays Revolving Credit Facility:
The Barclays Revolving Credit Facility is a $
282.0
 million senior secured revolving credit facility.  Associated with the Barclays Revolving Credit Facility is deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, of $
1.9
 million at December 31, 2024.
After we entered the first amendment on November 26, 2024, amounts borrowed under the Barclays Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either SOFR plus 
2.75
% or the Prime Rate plus 
1.8
% (with step-downs based on attainment of certain first lien net leverage ratio benchmarks).  As of December 31, 2024, the effective interest rate payable on revolving loans under the Barclays Revolving Credit Facility was 
10.50
%.  In addition, a commitment fee of 
0.50
% per annum accrues on the unused revolver commitments under the Barclays Revolving Credit Facility.
We had 
no
 outstanding balance under our $
282.0
 million Barclays Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2024.  After reserves of $
7.6
 million for certain letters of credit, $
274.4
 million was available to draw upon as of December 31, 2024.  
The Barclays Revolving Credit Facility terminates on April 18, 2029, unless otherwise accelerated under the terms of the Barclays Credit Agreement.
Truist Credit Facility
On October 7, 2022 our subsidiary New Jersey Imaging Network, Inc.("NJIN") entered into Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement (the “Truist Credit Agreement”), with Truist Bank and the lenders and financial institutions named therein, which provides for a $
150.0
 million term loan (the "Truist Term Loan") and a $
50.0
 million revolving credit facility (the “Truist Revolving Credit Facility”). The Truist Credit agreement is secured by the assets of NJIN.
Truist Term Loan:
The Truist Term Loan currently bears interest at SOFR or a Base Rate plus an applicable margin and fees which step down based on a leverage ratio. At December 31, 2024 the applicable margin for SOFR was 
1.5
%.
We are required to make quarterly principal payments of $
1.9
 million, which increases by $
0.9
 million at scheduled intervals, with the remaining balance to be paid at maturity. The Truist Term Loan will mature on October 10, 2027 unless otherwise accelerated under the terms of the Truist Credit Agreement.
Truist Revolving Credit Facility:
The Truist Revolving Credit Facility is a $
50.0
 million secured revolving credit facility. Associated with the Truist Revolving Credit Facility are deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, of  $
0.4
 million at December 
89
31, 2024. 
Amounts borrowed under the Truist Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either SOFR or a Base Rate plus an applicable margin and fees which step down based on a leverage ratio. In addition, a commitment fee of 
0.30
% per annum accrues on the unused revolver commitments under the Truist Revolving Credit Facility.
We had 
no
 balance under our $
50.0
 million Truist Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2024. With no letters of credit reserved against the facility, the full $
50.0
 million was available to draw upon as of December 31, 2024.  
The Truist Revolving Credit Facility terminates on October 7, 2027, unless otherwise accelerated under the terms of the Truist Credit Agreement.  
Notes Payable
We have issued certain notes payable in connection with the purchase of equipment previously leased under operating leases.  On April 1, 2024, January 15, 2024, and February 1, 2023 we issued promissory notes in the amount of $
6.3
 million, $
6.9

NOTE 9 – 
LEASES
Our material lease contracts are for facilities and advanced radiology equipment.  In regards to our imaging, administrative and warehouse facilities, the most common initial lease term varies in length from 
5
 to 
15
 years. Including renewal options negotiated with the landlord, we can have a total span of 
10
 to 
35
 years at these locations, and we do not enter into purchase options on the underlying property.  We also lease smaller satellite X-Ray locations on mutually renewable terms, usually lasting one year.  Leases for advanced radiology and office equipment have terms generally lasting from 
5
 to 
8
 years.  All leases are classified as operating or finance for accounting purposes, depending on the terms of the agreement.  Our incremental borrowing rate used to discount the stream of lease payments is closely related to the interest rates charged on our 
90
collateralized debt obligations and our incremental borrowing rate is adjusted when those rates experience a substantial change. Operating lease costs are recognized as cost of operation in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

As of December 31, 2024, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
128.2
 million, which is comprised of definite and indefinite net operating losses.  We had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
63.2
 million, which expire at various intervals from the years 2026 to 2037, and had carryforwards of $
65.0
 million of net operating losses which do not expire. Federal net operating losses generated in tax years following December 31, 2017 carryover indefinitely and may be used to offset up to 80% of future taxable net income.  We also had state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
145.3
 million, which expire at various intervals from the years 2025 through 2042. As of December 31, 2024, $
24.9
 million of our federal net operating loss carryforwards acquired in connection with the 2011 acquisition of Raven Holdings U.S., Inc. and the 2019 acquisition of Nulogix Health, Inc. are subject to limitations related to their utilization under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $
56.3
 million, which do not expire and are carried over indefinitely.

We considered all evidence available when determining whether deferred tax assets are more likely-than-not to be realized, including projected future taxable income, scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, prudent tax planning strategies, and recent financial operations. The evaluation of this evidence requires significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income, based on the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income. As of December 31, 2024, we have determined that deferred tax assets of $
210.5
 million are more likely-than-not to be realized. We have also determined deferred tax liabilities of $
45.8
 million are related to book basis in goodwill that has an indefinite life.

We file consolidated income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and foreign jurisdictions. We continue to reinvest earnings of the non-US entities for the foreseeable future and therefore have not recognized any U.S. tax expense on these earnings. With limited exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2019. We do not anticipate the results of any open examinations would result in a material change to our financial position.

 million will affect the effective tax rate if recognized.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During the year ended December 31, 2024 the Company accrued approximately $
22
 thousand of interest and penalties. As of December 31, 2024, accrued interest and penalties amounted to approximately $
0.4
 million.  We do not anticipate the uncertain tax position to change materially within the next 12 months.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development issued Pillar Two model rules for a global minimum tax of 15% effective January 1, 2024. While it is uncertain whether the United States will enact legislation to adopt Pillar Two,  certain countries in which we operate have adopted legislation, and other countries are in the process of introducing legislation to implement Pillar Two. Pillar Two had no impact on our 2024 ETR, and we do not currently expect Pillar Two to significantly impact our ETR going forward.

NOTE 11 – 
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

Stock Incentive Plans
We have 
one
 long-term incentive plan that we adopted in 2006 and which we have amended and restated at various points in time: April 20, 2015, March 9, 2017, April 15, 2021 April 27, 2023, and most recently by our stockholders at our annual stockholders meeting on June 7, 2023 (the “Restated Plan”). We have reserved 
20,100,000
 shares of common stock for issuance under the Restated Plan which can be issued in the form of incentive and/or nonstatutory stock options, restricted and/or unrestricted stock, stock units, and stock appreciation rights.  

Our stock-based compensation consists of various types of awards, each accounted for separately. There is no overlap between Options, DeepHealth options, Restricted stock awards (RSAs) and Restricted stock units (RSUs), performance stock units (PSUs), and performance stock options (PSOs).
Options
Certain options granted under the Restated Plan to employees are intended to qualify as incentive stock options under existing tax regulations. Stock options generally vest over 
one
 to 
five years
 and expire 
five
 to 
ten years
 from the date of grant.

35,522
 shares are expected to vest.
Performance based stock options ("PSOs")
In January 2022, we granted certain employees PSOs to purchase a maximum of 
111,925

Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of December 31, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are transacted in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Our management, under the supervision of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, as stated in their report, which is included below in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures

Our management does not expect that internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all misstatements or incidences of fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design and implementation of a control system is limited by resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in business conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act)  during the quarter ended December 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of RadNet, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited RadNet, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, RadNet, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes

and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
