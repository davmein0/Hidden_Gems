ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Some of the information contained in this MD&A or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please review Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following MD&A.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW
MARA is a vertically integrated energy and digital infrastructure company that leverages high-intensity compute, such as bitcoin mining, to monetize underutilized energy assets and optimize power management. As of December 31, 2024, our total energy portfolio consisted of approximately 1.7 gigawatts (“GW”) of capacity with 16 data centers deployed across North America, the Middle East, Europe, and Latin America. We believe we are the world’s largest publicly traded bitcoin mining company, with the majority of our production in the United States.
Historically, we were focused on establishing MARA as the largest and most efficient bitcoin miner. As of December 31, 2024, we operated approximately 400,000 bitcoin mining ASICs, capable of producing 53.2 EH/s with an efficiency of 19.2 joules per terahash, which is among the most efficient in the industry.
In 2024, we began our strategic transformation into a vertically integrated energy and digital infrastructure company to provide services and products, such as load management and immersion cooling systems, to data center operators and the energy sector. To support this transformation, we secured 300% more energy capacity, expanding our total energy portfolio from approximately 0.5 GW to approximately 1.7 GW, while increasing our owned data center portfolio capacity from nearly zero at the beginning of 2024 to approximately 70%
 to date. 
As part of this initiative, we secured approximately 1.2 GW of nameplate capacity across the United States.
In 2024, we adopted a full HODL strategy, retaining all bitcoin mined in our operations or opportunistically purchased in the open market using available cash and proceeds from private offerings of an aggregate principal amount of $2.2 billion of 2024 Convertible Notes. Using available cash and proceeds from the 2024 Convertible Notes, we purchased 22,065 bitcoin at an average price of $87,205 per bitcoin in 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we held approximately 44,893 bitcoin, of which 10,374 were loaned or collateralized.
In 2025, we expect to remain the dominant player in bitcoin mining while expanding our footprint in energy generation and investing in research and development to establish our presence in AI and adjacent markets, creating additional revenue opportunit
ies over the long term. 
We believe the AI industry is shifting towards inference computing, which requires distributed, low-latency, and energy-efficient infrastructure. To support this shift, we are developing modular at the edge infrastructure solutions, including next-generation two-phase immersion cooling (“2PIC”) systems designed to improve efficiency and sustainability. We are also exploring power management solutions, including load balancing, to provide services to the variable energy demands of AI inference workloads. We intend to continue vertically integrating and further reduce energy costs. 
HIGHLIGHTS
2024 was a transformative year for MARA, as we more than doubled our exahash, significantly enhancing our mining capabilities and reinforcing our position as a leader in the bitcoin mining space. Historically, we utilized an asset-light strategy to significantly grow our market share. In 2024, we strategically transitioned into a vertically integrated energy and digital infrastructure company by acquiring five data centers which we own and operate, increasing our percentage of owned capacity to approximately 70%. This is a critical step toward achieving greater operational control and efficiency.
Additionally, we strengthened our bitcoin holdings through both mining activities and strategic use of convertible debt, further enhancing our financial position. As we continue to scale, our goal is for MARA to be recognized

primarily as an energy and digital infrastructure company, transforming every available stranded electron into digital gold – bitcoin – while unlocking new value for our stakeholders in the evolving energy and digital asset landscape. 
Acquisitions
•
Granbury, TX and Kearney, NE
: In January 2024, we acquired two operational bitcoin mining sites totaling 390 MW of nameplate capacity. We believe our state-of-the-art 290 MW nameplate capacity data center in Granbury is one of the largest containerized liquid immersion-cooled sites worldwide. Since acquiring the site, profitability at the site has nearly doubled, we grew our hashrate to 12.1 EH/s in December 2024 and cost per petahash improved 45% during the year to 29.8. In addition, we have made significant investments in the local community and continue to be a strategic partner.
•
Garden City, TX
: In April 2024, we acquired an operational bitcoin mining site with 132 megawatts of operational capacity and 200 MW of nameplate capacity.
•
Hannibal, Hopedale, and Findlay, OH
: In November 2024, we acquired two operational data centers with 222 MW of interconnect-approved capacity. In addition to the acquired data centers, we began developing a 150 MW greenfield operational data center in Findlay, Ohio.
•
Hansford County, TX
: In February 2025, we acquired a wind farm with 240 MW of interconnection capacity and 114 MW of nameplate wind capacity. 
Digital Assets
•
Bitcoin Halving
: On April 19, 2024, a halving event occurred on the Bitcoin network. The halving event reduced the block subsidy by half from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoin per block. Transaction fees, which together with the block subsidy, comprise the block reward for successfully solving a block, are not directly impacted by the halving.
•
Kaspa Mining
: During the second quarter of 2024, we announced our Kaspa mining operations, and have continued to utilize Kaspa sales proceeds to fund operations, thereby enabling us to hold a larger amount of bitcoin.
•
Line of Credit
: In October 2024, we secured a $200.0 million line of credit, collateralized by a portion of our bitcoin holdings. We used the funds for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 
2,997 bitcoin remained collateralized in connection with the line of credit.
•
Bitcoin Lending Arrangements
: Throughout the fourth quarter of 2024, we entered into lending arrangements with various counterparties to generate yield from our loaned bitcoin. As of December 31, 2024, a total of 7,377 bitcoin, or approximately $688.7 million, has been loaned to counterparties.

Bitcoin HODL and Acquisition Strategy
During 2024, we adopted a HODL strategy, retaining all bitcoin mined in our operations or opportunistically purchased in the open market using available cash and proceeds from private offerings of an aggregate principal amount of $2.2 billion of 2024 Convertible Notes in private offerings. Using available cash and proceeds from the 2024 Convertible Notes, we purchased 22,065 bitcoin at an average price of $87,205 per bitcoin in 2024.

Low Cost Strategy
We aim not only to own and operate our infrastructure, but also energy generation assets. To achieve this, we will continue to identify potential sites where we can generate low cost energy. By owning energy assets, we can optimize how power is consumed, stored, and distributed. This allows us to better serve data centers, AI operators, and energy markets. We can co-locate with them, balance their load, and generate revenue to offset costs in ways that grid-reliant miners simply cannot. We have spent the last several months methodically executing a plan to build infrastructure that is not just about mining bitcoin, but about being the lowest-cost producer in an environment where efficiency and adaptability are paramount.
•
We launched a 25 MW micro data center initiative at wellheads in Texas and North Dakota, converting excess flared gas into power for our operations. These sites reduce our reliance on grid power and provide us with the lowest cost per bitcoin of our currently operational sites.
•
The wind farm in Hansford County, Texas will utilize prior-generation ASIC mining hardware to provide an avenue for the hardware to continue operating profitably beyond its normal lifecycle.
•
In Finland, we deployed two pilot projects to recycle heat from our operations, providing heat to communities with a total population of approximately 80,000 residents. These sites offset our production costs through heat sales while reducing the local communities’ reliance on high carbon emitting biomass and delivering renewable and more affordable heating to communities.
TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES IMPACTING OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY
Bitcoin Value
Our revenues are generally comprised of block rewards earned in bitcoin as a result of successfully solving blocks, and transaction fees earned for verifying transactions in support of the blockchain. After the halving event of April 2024, the current reward for each solved block is equal to 3.125 bitcoin plus transaction fees. The impacts of halving on our results of operations and financial condition may be exacerbated by changes in the market value of bitcoin, which has historically been subject to significant volatility. For example, as of December 31, 2024, the price of a bitcoin was $93,354, compared to $42,288 as of December 31, 2023. We held 
approximately 44,893 bitcoin, including loaned and collateralized bitcoin, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets with a 
carrying
 value of approximately 
$4.2 billion as of December 31, 2024, which value may be materially impacted as the market value of bitcoin fluctuates. Management believes, given our recent investments, coupled with our relative position and liquidity, we are well-positioned to execute on our long-term growth strategy.

Table of 
Contents
Mining Rig Capacity, Efficiency, and Hashrate
In response to an increased demand for bitcoin, we anticipate additional mining operators entering the market and existing competitors scaling their operations, which will grow the blockchain’s network hashrate and difficulty associated with solving a block. As the overall hashrate and difficulty of the Bitcoin network increases, we will need to continue growing our hashrate and remain competitive. During 2024, we mined 9,430 bitcoin, a decrease of 3,422 bitcoin, or 27%, over the prior year period. As of December 31, 2024, we operated approximately 400,000 mining rigs globally, with energized hashrate approximately 53.2 exahashes per second. To stay competitive, we remain focused on strategically deploying additional mining rigs and scaling our operations, while managing our fleet as it ages along the obsolescence curve. In addition, we continuously evaluate strategic opportunities to support our growth strategy, and seek to enhance operational efficiencies by utilizing efficient mining rigs and securing contracts with price protection clauses.
Energy Cost
Energy cost is the most significant cost driver for mining and represented 40.8%, as a percentage of our owned mining revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024. This excludes energy costs from third party hosted sites.
Energy cost can be highly volatile and sensitive to geopolitical events and weather conditions, such as winter storms and earthquakes, which impact supply and demand for power regionally. All of our owned mining sites and our hosted miners are subject to variable prices and market rate fluctuations with respect to wholesale energy costs. Such costs are governed by various power purchase agreements, and energy prices can change hour to hour and by location. While this renders energy prices less predictable, it also gives us greater ability and flexibility to actively manage the energy we consume with a goal of increasing profitability and energy efficiency. When such events occur, we may curtail our operations to avoid using power at increased rates. Although we do not directly receive compensation for curtailment, the dispatchable load of our bitcoin mining operations helps balance the grid and provides electricity to communities when in need. The average price for direct energy we paid in our owned facilities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $0.04 per KWh. 
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

In order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by our management team in financial and operational decision-making, we supplement our Consolidated Financial Statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) with the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDA and total margin excluding depreciation and amortization.
We define adjusted EBITDA as (a) GAAP net income plus (b) adjustments to add back the impacts of (1) interest, (2) income taxes, (3) depreciation and amortization and (4) adjustments for non-cash and/or non-recurring items which currently include (i) stock compensation expense, (ii) change in fair value of derivative instrument, (iii) early termination expenses and other, (iv) net gain from extinguishment of debt. We define total margin excluding depreciation and amortization as (a) GAAP total margin less (b) depreciation and amortization.
Management uses adjusted EBITDA and total margin excluding depreciation and amortization, along with the supplemental information provided herein, as a means of understanding, managing and evaluating business performance and to help inform operating decision-making. We rely primarily on our Consolidated Financial Statements to understand, manage and evaluate our financial performance and uses non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.
We believe that adjusted EBITDA and total margin excluding depreciation and amortization are useful measures to us and to our investors because they exclude certain financial, capital structure and non-cash items that we do not believe directly reflect our core operations and may not be indicative of our recurring operations, in part because they may vary widely across time and within our industry independent of the performance of our core operations. We believe that excluding these items enables us to more effectively evaluate our performance period-over-period and relative to our competitors.
Adjusted EBITDA and total margin excluding depreciation and amortization
 are not recognized measurements under GAAP. When analyzing our operating results, investors should use them in addition to, but not as an

We define Energized Hashrate as the total hashrate that could theoretically be generated if all mining rigs that have been operational are currently in operation and running at 100% of manufacturers’ specifications. We use this metric as an indicator of progress in bringing mining rigs online. We believe this metric is a useful indicator of potential bitcoin production. However, metrics cannot be tied directly to any production level expected to be actually achieved as (a) there may be delays in the energization of hashrate (b) we cannot predict when operational mining rigs may be offline for any reason, including curtailment or machine failure and (c) we cannot predict Global Hashrate (and therefore our share of the Global Hashrate), which has a significant impact on our ability to generate bitcoin in any given period.
(3)
 Direct Energy Cost per bitcoin is calculated as the amounts paid to utility companies for power consumed divided by the quantity of bitcoin produced during the period related to our owned mining operations.
(4)
 Cost per KWh is calculated using the amounts paid to utility companies for power consumed divided by the KWh consumed. Prior to 2024, the Company operated an asset-light strategy and did not own mining facilities.

(5)
 Cost per Petahash per day is calculated using mining cost of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization, divided by the daily average operational hashrate online during the period, excluding our share of the hashrate for the equity method investee, the ADGM Entity, by a factor of 1,000. 
(6)
 BTC Yield is a key performance indicator that represents the percentage change period-to-period of the ratio between our bitcoin holdings and our Assumed Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding. Assumed Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding refers to the aggregate of our actual shares of common stock outstanding as of the end of the applicable period plus all additional shares that would result from the assumed conversion of all outstanding convertible notes, exercise of all outstanding warrants and settlement of all outstanding restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units.
(7)

Average cost of BTC mined is calculated using the bitcoin mining cost of revenues, excluding depreciation and amortization, divided by the bitcoin production, excluding our share of the bitcoin produced for the equity method investee, the ADGM entity. Average cost of BTC produced is calculated using the total cost of bitcoin purchased divided by the total bitcoin purchased.
(8)
 Includes approximately $12.4 million and $2.1 million of depreciation and amortization from our share in the results of our equity method investee, the ADGM entity, reported in “Equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliate” for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
(9)
 Early termination expenses represent amounts recognized as the cost to early terminate data center hosting agreements in addition to the gain on investments during the period.
Revenues
: We generated revenues of $656.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $387.5 million in the prior year period. The $268.9 million or approximately 69% increase in revenues was primarily driven by a $326.7 million increase in the average price of bitcoin mined, which was partially offset by a $111.3 million decrease in bitcoin production due to the April 2024 halving, and the inclusion of $31.6 million in revenues generated from providing hosting services as a result of acquisitions during 2024. The average price of bitcoin mined was 120% higher than the average price of bitcoin mined in the prior year period and average daily bitcoin production was 25.8 bitcoin in the current year period compared with 35.2 in the prior year period. We produced 3,422 less bitcoin for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to the halving event in April 2024, increase in global hashrate and the impact of unexpected equipment failures at third-party operated sites and transmission line maintenance during the second and third quarters of 2024, partially offset by an increase in our share of the network hashrate. 

Cost of revenues – mining
 during the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $381.6 million compared to $223.3 million in the prior year period. The $158.3 million or approximately 71% increase was primarily driven by the growth in our hashrate from the deployment and energization of mining rigs compared to the prior year period. Partially offsetting the increase was the impact of unexpected equipment failures and transmission line maintenance, which resulted in downtime that reduced hosting and energy costs. We believe Cost per Petahash per day to be a key metric to evaluate our operating costs. Our Cost per Petahash per day improved to $38.6 from $46.4, or approximately 17%, in the year ended December 31, 2024 when compared to the prior year period, primarily due to strategic acquisitions with more efficient cost structures and deployment of more efficient miners. Our Direct Energy Cost per bitcoin for owned mining sites was $28,801.
Cost of revenues – hosting services
 during the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $30.4 million which includes cost of power and other hosting related operating costs to provide hosting services as a result of the GC Data Center Acquisition and the Arkon Acquisition. As of December 31, 2024, we exited a majority of our hosting facilities to strategically focus on our owned mining business.
Cost of revenues – depreciation and amortization
 during the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $403.7 million compared to $179.5 million in the prior year period. The $224.2 million or approximately 125% increase was primarily due to the deployment of mining rigs since the prior year period, the acquisitions of GC Data Center Acquisition, the Garden City Acquisition and the Arkon Acquisition and overall increased scale of the business.

General and administrative expenses
: General and administrative expenses were $272.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $92.4 million in the prior year period, an increase of $179.7 million or approximately 194%. General and administrative expenses excluding stock-based compensation was $114.4 million in the current year period compared to $59.8 million in the prior year period. The $54.7 million or approximately 91% increase in expenses was primarily due to the increased scale of the business and our strategic shift to an asset-heavy strategy, including payroll and benefits, professional fees, facility and equipment repair and maintenance expenses, and other third-party costs associated with growth in the business. The increase in stock-based compensation of $32.6 million in the prior year period to $157.6 million in the current year was primarily due to (1) restricted stock unit awards related to 2023 performance awarded and partially expensed in 2024, (2) 2024 performance-based restricted stock units awarded and partially expensed in 2024, (3) an accounting charge related to the modification of our peer index to consist exclusively of publicly traded bitcoin mining companies and (4) threefold increase in our headcount from 48 to 152 due to growth and a pivot towards an asset-heavy strategy. As such, 2024 stock-based compensation expense reflects the impact of two annual grant awards.
Change in fair value of digital assets
: We recognized a gain on digital assets of $813.8 million, compared to a gain of $331.5 million in the prior year period. The $482.3 million or approximately 146% increase was primarily related to the increase in bitcoin price from $42,288 to $93,354 from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024, respectively and the underlying digital assets held at the respective dates. As of December 31, 2024, we had 44,893 bitcoin, an increase of 197% compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the 22,065 bitcoin purchased throughout the year ended 2024. We view bitcoin on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as an important treasury reserve asset and expect to continue to invest in the future. 
Change in fair value of derivative instrument
: We acquired a commodity swap contract as a result of our acquisition of GC Data Center Acquisition. The commodity swap contract hedges price variability in electricity purchases and expires on December 31, 2027. The commodity swap contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument and is remeasured at fair value each reporting period with changes recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value of this derivative decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to unfavorable movement in electricity forward curve prices during the current year period. 
Research and development:
 Research and development expenses were $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $2.8 million in the prior year period. These expenses consisted primarily of contractor costs, supplies, personnel, and related expenses for our mining and technology businesses.
Early termination expenses
: On January 30, 2024, we entered into a termination and transition agreement (“Agreement”) with the operator, US Bitcoin Corp (“USBTC”), of the two sites from the January 12, 2024, acquisition of GC Data Center Acquisition. MARA and USBTC agreed to terminate the acquired operating agreement for a termination fee of $19.6 million, net of deposit refund. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2024, we terminated the remaining hosting agreements with customers from the GC Data Center Acquisition, and recognized early termination expenses of $18.4 million, to expand self-mining capacity.

Table of 
Contents
Amortization of intangible assets: 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we fully amortized the customer relationships acquired in the GC Data Center Acquisition for $22.0 million, due to our strategic decision to exit hosting services business and termination of customer relationships. There was no amortization expense of intangible assets in the prior year period.
Change in fair value of digital assets - receivable, net: 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we entered into four separate lending agreements with various counterparties and collateralized a portion of our bitcoin holdings in connection with a line of credit. We recognized a gain on digital assets - receivables, net of $299.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. There were no such activities in the prior year period. 
Gain on investments: 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we purchased additional shares in Auradine, Inc. (“Auradine”) preferred stock and recorded a gain on investments of $5.2 million to adjust the carrying amount of our investment. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2024 we wrote-down a previous SAFE investment for a loss of $1.0 million. 
Net gain from extinguishment of debt: 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, in connection with the issuance of the June 2031 Notes and March 2030 Notes, we entered into agreements to repurchase approximately $263.2 million principal amount of the December 2026 Notes and as a result, recorded a gain of $13.1 million. In the prior year period, we entered into agreements with certain holders of December 2026 Notes to exchange an aggregate $416.8 million principal amount of December 2026 Notes for 31,722,417 shares of our common stock and recorded a gain in the amount of $82.6 million.
Loss on hedge instruments: 
Loss on hedge instruments during the year ended December 31, 2024, was $0.6 million compared to $17.4 million in the prior year period for losses related to bitcoin hedging activities. The decrease was due to a larger loss in the prior period related to the increase in the fair value of the sold call portion of the collar as a result of the significant increase in the fair value of bitcoin. These modified collars protect against the downside price risk of bitcoin while retaining some upside exposure. There were various outstanding bitcoin hedging transactions as of the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Equity in net earnings of unconsolidated affiliate: 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded our share of net losses for our 20% interest in the ADGM Entity in the amount of $1.5 million, compared to $0.6 million in the prior year period. Our share of the ADGM Entity’s operating results included earnings from the production of 382 bitcoin, a $4.1 million impairment of property and equipment and approximately $12.4 million of depreciation and amortization during the year ended December 31, 2024, whereas in the prior year period, our share of ADGM Entity’s operating results included earnings from production of 112 bitcoin and approximately $2.1 million of depreciation and amortization.
Interest income
: Interest income was $16.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $2.8 million in the prior year period. The $13.9 million increase was primarily due to the higher average balance of cash and cash equivalents and interest earned on loaned bitcoin in the current year period.

Interest expense
: Interest expense was $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $10.4 million in the prior year period. The $2.6 million or approximately 26% increase was a result of the exchange of $416.8 million aggregate principal amount of the December 2026 Notes for shares of our common stock in September 2023 and the issuance of the 2024 Convertible Notes during the year ended December 31, 2024.
Other non-operating loss: 
During the year, we launched a program to generate additional return by loaning bitcoin and collateralized a portion of our bitcoin holdings to secure a line of credit. We recorded a corresponding allowance for credit loss of $8.4 million, for the bitcoin loaned and collateralized during the year ended December 31, 2024. There were no such activities in the prior year period.

Income tax benefit (expense)
: We recorded income tax expense of $75.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to an income tax expense of $16.4 million in the prior year period. The $75.5 million income tax expense primarily arises from the release of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, driven by the increase in bitcoin’s fair value and positive forecasts for its future value.
42
Table of 
Contents
Net income
: We recorded net income of $541.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to net income of $261.2 million in the prior year period. The $279.8 million increase in net income was primarily driven by a $85.2 million increase in operating income and a $299.8 million change in fair value of digital assets - receivable, net, partially offset by a $69.1 million decrease in net gain from the extinguishment of debt and a $59.1 million income tax expense in the current period compared to the prior year period.

Adjusted EBITDA
: Adjusted EBITDA was $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to adjusted EBITDA of $417.1 million in the prior year period. The $815.1 million increase was primarily due to an $80.2 million margin improvement from higher average bitcoin price mined at a lower Cost per Petahash per day and a $782.1 million increase in the change in fair value of digital assets, partially offset by an $54.7 million increase in general and administrative excluding stock-based compensation.

Cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024: 
Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash totaled $403.8 million at December 31, 2024, an increase of $46.5 million from December 31, 2023.

Cash flows from operating activities resulted in a use of funds of $677.0 million, as net income, adjusted for non-cash and non-operating items, in the amount of $121.6 million was more than offset by the use of cash of $798.6 million from changes in operating assets and liabilities. When we produce and hold bitcoin on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, we exclude such produced and held bitcoin from our operating cash flows. If we monetize bitcoin in the future, those proceeds are reported as cash flows from investing activities. Changes in cash flows from operating assets and liabilities were driven by a use of funds associated with changes in digital assets of $624.7 million due to the non-cash adjustment for bitcoin mining revenues and deposits of $189.6 million resulting from increased deposits associated with hosting agreements and a surety bond.

Cash flows from investing activities resulted in a use of funds of $3.2 billion, primarily resulting from the use of funds for advances to vendors of $817.3 million, purchase of digital assets of $1.9 billion from the issuance of 2024 Convertible Notes, payment for the acquisition of businesses of $335.6 million as we increased our percentage of owned capacity to approximately 70%, acquiring 812 MW of nameplate capacity throughout the year ended December 31, 2024, capital expenditures of $250.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of digital assets of $152.3 million.

Cash flows from financing activities resulted in a source of cash of $4.0 billion, primarily from the periodic issuance of common stock under our 2024 ATM of $1.9 billion, the issuance of the 2024 Convertible Notes of $2.2 billion, net of issuance costs, partially offset by the repayment of $247.3 million of the December 2026 Notes.
Cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023: 
Cash and cash equivalents totaled $357.3 million at December 31, 2023, an increase of $244.8 million from December 31, 2022.

Bitcoin holdings as of December 31, 2024:
 At December 31, 2024, we held a total of 44,893 bitcoin, including loaned and collateralized bitcoin, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets with a total fair value of $4.2 billion. The fair value of a single bitcoin was approximately $93,354 at December 31, 2024.
43
Table of 
Contents
Approximately 7,377 of our total bitcoin holdings were loaned to third parties to generate additional return and 2,997 bitcoin were utilized as collateral for borrowings. Loaned and collateralized bitcoin are classified as “Digital asset - receivables, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with a carrying value of $960.1 million. 
The remaining 34,519 of unrestricted bitcoin were classified as long-term digital assets, as part of our strategy to hold bitcoin on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with a fair value of $3.2 billion. Our holdings as of December 31, 2024 excluded 51 bitcoin held by our equity method investee, pending dividend to us.
We expect that our future bitcoin holdings will generally increase but will fluctuate from time to time, both in number of bitcoin held and fair value in U.S. dollars, depending upon operating and market conditions. We intend to add to our bitcoin holdings primarily through our production activities and from time to time purchases. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we purchased 22,065 bitcoin for $1.9 billion. We purchased bitcoin from cash on hand and from the proceeds from the issuances of the 2024 Convertible Notes throughout the year, as part of our strategy to hold bitcoin and not sell for the foreseeable future. As a result of our adoption of the aforementioned strategy, we anticipate funding our operating and investing activities principally from available cash and cash equivalents and from our financing activities.
Kaspa
 holdings as of December 31, 2024:
 In 2023, we began evaluating Kaspa as a potential way to diversify our revenue while continuing to utilize our current infrastructure and expertise in digital asset compute. At December 31, 2024, we held approximately 
$4.3 million, or 34,817,098
 Kaspa coins, on our 
Consolidated
 Balance Sheets. 
During the year ended 
December 31, 2024,
 we incurred significantly less cost to produce Kaspa compared to bitcoin, which helps pay for our expenses and allows us to hold a larger amount of bitcoin on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
At-the-Market Offering Programs and Proceeds:
 As of December 31, 2024, we sold 93,411,158 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1.9 billion, net of commission and offering expenses of $47.5 million, pursuant to our at-the-market offerings.
Liquidity and Capital Resources:
 Cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, totaled $391.8 million and the fair value of digital asset holdings, including loaned and collateralized bitcoin, was $4.2 billion at December 31, 2024. The combined value of cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, and digital assets, including loaned and collateralized bitcoin, totaled nearly $4.6 billion as of December 31, 2024.
During 2024, our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources were proceeds from convertible notes issuances, sales under our ATM, sales of digital assets, lending facilities and available cash and cash equivalents. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we significantly reduced our reliance solely on ATM. Our ATM usage represented 43% of our cash needs, compared to 97% in the prior year period. We expect as commercial banks open up our sector due to abolishment of Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) 121, as rescinded by SAB 122, that we will have expanded access to traditional financing, such as debt financing, project financing and other capital.
While we classify our digital assets and digital asset receivables as long-term, consistent with the announced HODL strategy, both asset types are readily convertible to cash, and therefore considered a liquid resource.
We expect to have sufficient liquidity, including cash on hand and access to public capital markets, to support ongoing operations in the next 12 months and beyond. We will continue to seek to fund our business activities, and especially our growth opportunities, through the public capital markets, primarily through periodic equity issuances using our at-the-market facilities.

The risks to our liquidity outlook would include events that materially diminish our access to capital markets and/or the value of our bitcoin holdings and production capabilities, including:
•
Failure to effectively execute our growth strategies;
•
Declines in bitcoin prices and/or production, as well as impacts from bitcoin halving events, which would impact both the value of our bitcoin holdings and our ongoing profitability;
44
Table of 
Contents
•
Significant increases in electricity costs if these cost increases were not accompanied by increases in the price of bitcoin, as this would also reduce profitability; and
•
Deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, including the impacts of inflation and increased interest rates, as well as instability in the banking system.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS
We contract with service providers for hosting our equipment and operational support in data centers where our equipment is deployed. Under these arrangements, we expect to pay at a minimum approximately (i) $471.3 million in total payments during the calendar years 2025 through 2027, and (ii) $9.9 million in total payments during the calendar years 2028 through 2029. Under certain of these arrangements, we are required to pay variable pass-through power and service fees in addition to these estimated minimum amounts.
We have purchase agreements to purchase miners and other mining equipment for a total purchase price of $962.7 million. As of December 31, 2024, we have made installment payments totaling $823.5 million. We expect to make periodic payments in accordance with the payment schedule with the final payment expected to occur during 2025. 
Assuming the remaining outstanding 1.0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “December 2026 Notes”) and the 2024 Convertible Notes (collectively, the “Convertible Notes”) are not converted into common stock, repurchased or redeemed prior to maturity, (i) annual interest payments of approximately $0.7 million in each calendar year from 2025 through 2026 in connection with the December 2026 Notes and annual interest payments of approximately $6.4 million in each calendar year from 2025 through 2031 in connection with the 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2031 and (ii) principal for each of the Convertible Notes upon maturity, for a total of $2.3 billion, will be payable under the terms of the Convertible Notes. Refer to Note 17 
– 
Debt in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further information.
We have operating and finance lease obligations related to land and office buildings. We expect to make payments of $1.9 million and $0.2 million related to operating and finance leases, respectively, in 2025 and $32.3 million and $89.6 million related to operating and finance leases, respectively, thereafter. Refer to Note 18

 Leases in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report, for further information.
On October 15, 2024, we announced securing a $200.0 million line of credit, collateralized by approximately 
2,997 of
 our bitcoin holdings. We used the funds for general corporate purposes. As of October 17, 2024, the facility was fully utilized.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The following accounting estimates relate to the significant areas involving management’s judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements, and are those that it believes are the most critical to aid the understanding and evaluation of this management discussion and analysis:
•
Digital assets - receivable, net
•
Long-lived assets
•
Income taxes
•
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination
•
Goodwill impairment
•
Loss contingencies
45
Table of 
Contents
Digital assets - receivable, net
When we loan digital assets to a third-party entity, we first evaluate whether to derecognize such digital assets based on an evaluation of relevant control and asset derecognition considerations that include whether:
•
We have transferred present rights to the economic benefits associated with the digital asset for a different right to receive digital assets in the future;
•
We cannot sell, pledge, loan, or otherwise use the lent digital assets while the loan is outstanding, as those rights have been transferred to the borrower;
•
Inherent in the realization of the economic benefits associated with the digital asset receivable is exposure to credit risk of the third-party entity; and
•
The third-party entity that holds the digital assets can deploy those assets at its discretion for the duration of the lending arrangement and bears the risk of loss or theft of those assets, and otherwise has the ability to direct the use of the assets transferred.
If we conclude derecognition is appropriate, we derecognize the loaned digital assets that we no longer control and recognizes a right to receive back in the future such loaned digital assets.
In accordance with ASU 2023-08, digital asset receivable is recorded at the fair value of the underlying digital assets. Throughout the period that the digital asset receivable is outstanding, the receivable will be measured at fair value of the underlying loaned digital asset with changes recorded in other non-operating income (loss) in current period earnings. 
At loan commencement and throughout the loan period, we consider and account for the credit risk of the borrower using the principles in Topic 326 – Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (“Topic 326”) to measure any credit impairment. The digital asset receivable is presented net of any allowance for credit losses. We utilize the probability of default (“PD”) loss given default (“LGD”) approach to estimating the allowance for credit loss (“ACL”) at origination and subsequent reporting periods. In order to apply the PD LGD approach, management considers the lifetime of the digital asset receivable, the reasonable and supportable forecast period, and the PD LGD. We use
 each instrument’s life of loan period for estimating current expected credit losses, unadjusted by any prepayment risk as any risk would be immaterial to either the repayment in kind or the accrued loan fee receivable.
Long-Lived Assets
We have long-lived assets that consist primarily of property and equipment stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment, as applicable. The depreciation charge is calculated on a straight-line basis and depends on the estimated useful lives of each type of asset and, in certain circumstances, estimates of fair values and residual values. Our property and equipment is primarily composed of digital asset mining rigs, which are largely homogeneous and have approximately the same useful lives. Accordingly, we utilize the group method of depreciation for our digital asset mining rigs. We update the estimated useful lives of our asset group of digital asset mining rigs periodically as information on the operations of the mining rigs indicate changes are required. We assess and adjust the estimated useful lives of our mining rigs when there are indicators that the productivity of the mining assets is higher or lower than the assigned estimated useful lives.
Management reviews our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of their carrying amount to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated thereby. If such assets are not recoverable based on that test, impairment is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value as determined in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 820.

Income Taxes

The primary objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740 - 
Income Taxes
, using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated based on enacted tax rates and are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. Management must make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our income tax benefit or expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities. We recognize tax positions when they are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit greater than 50% likely of being realized. Each period, we evaluate tax positions and adjust related tax assets and liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances. 
Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination
We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805 - 
Business Combinations
, by recognizing the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, measured at the acquisition date fair value. The determination of fair value involves assumptions, estimates and judgments. Any purchase consideration in excess of the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill Impairment
Goodwill is not subject to amortization, and instead, assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in accordance with ASC 350. 
Loss Contingencies
In the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in legal proceedings, claims and governmental and/or regulatory reviews. Management periodically reviews estimates of potential costs to be incurred by us in connection with the adjudication or settlement, if any, of these matters. These estimates are developed, as applicable in consultation with outside counsel, and are based on an analysis of potential outcomes. In accordance with ASC 450, 
Contingencies
, loss contingencies are accrued if, in the opinion of management, an adverse outcome is probable and such financial outcome can be reasonably estimated. The accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in our litigation strategy. It is possible that future results for any particular quarter or annual period may be materially affected by changes in our estimates or outcomes relating to these matters. 
Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a party. In view of these uncertainties, we could incur charges in excess of any currently established accruals and, to the extent available, liability insurance. In the opinion of management, any such future charges, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and/or consolidated cash flows. From time to time, we may challenge unfavorable outcomes and obtain surety bonds in connection therewith, and our exposure under such surety bonds will depend on the outcome of our challenge. We have in the past used, and may in the future use, borrowings under our master lending agreements or other financing sources to post such surety bonds, collateralized by bitcoin. If the price of bitcoin drops substantially, we may face a margin call on our borrowings under the master lending agreements, which would require us to provide additional collateral to avoid liquidation by lenders of pledged bitcoin to cover amounts owing.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards and pronouncements.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The following discussion about our market risk exposures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements.

Market Price Risk of Bitcoin.
 We hold a significant amount of bitcoin, and as such, we are exposed to the impact of market price changes in bitcoin on our bitcoin holdings. This exposure would generally manifest itself in the following areas:
•
Declines in the fair market value of bitcoin will impact the cash value that would be realized if we were to sell our bitcoin for cash, therefore having a negative impact on our liquidity.
•
We occasionally enter into derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure resulting from fluctuations in the price of bitcoin.

As of December 31, 2024, we held approximately 44,893 bitcoin, of which, 10,374 were loaned or collateralized, for a total fair value of approximately $4.2 billion.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of MARA Holdings, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MARA Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, based on our audits, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013 and our report dated March 3, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for digital assets during the year ended December 31, 2023 by early adopting ASU 2023-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets (Topic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets, effective January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective method.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
The accompanying notes are an integral part to these audited Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition from Mining Operations
As disclosed in Note 4 to the financial statements, the Company’s ongoing major or central operation is to provide bitcoin transaction verification services to the transaction requestor, in addition to the bitcoin network through a Company-operated mining pool as the operator, and to provide a service of performing hash calculations to third-party pool operators alongside collectives of third-party bitcoin miners as a participant.
We identified the procedures performed related to revenue recognition as a critical audit matter due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to perform audit procedures over the completeness, and occurrence of revenue recognized.
Addressing this matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. These procedures included, among others:
•
We performed site visits at the Company’s facilities where the mining hardware is located, which included observations of the physical controls and mining equipment inventory.
•
We independently traced certain financial and performance data directly to the blockchain network to test the completeness, occurrence and accuracy of mining revenue as the operator.
•
We independently confirmed with the third-party mining pool operator the significant contractual terms utilized in the determination of mining revenue, total mining rewards earned, and the digital asset wallet addresses in which the rewards are deposited to test the occurrence and accuracy of mining revenue as the participant.
•
We confirmed the year-end digital asset balances directly with the custodians of the Company’s wallets.
Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in Business Combinations
As disclosed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company completed acquisitions of two operational data centers and three operational bitcoin mining sites. The Company accounted for these transactions under the acquisition method for business combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including identified property, plant and equipment, customer relationship related intangible assets, and contingent earnouts.
We identified the fair valuation of property, plant and equipment, customer relationship related intangible assets and contingent earnouts as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions made by management in the process. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s forecast of future cash flows, and use of significant unobservable inputs and assumptions, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. 
Addressing this matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. These procedures included, among others:
•
We obtained an understanding of management’s process over the valuation of these identified assets and liabilities. 
•
We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecast of future cash flows used in the fair valuation of customer relationship related intangible assets by comparing to contracts, historical results and other metrics.
•
With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodology, and significant unobservable inputs and assumptions by:
◦
Testing the source information underlying the determination of certain significant unobservable inputs and assumptions;

NOTE 2 – 
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries. Consolidated subsidiaries’ results are included from the date the subsidiary was formed or acquired. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions, including any noncontrolling interest, have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates and Assumptions

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements include fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, estimates associated with the useful lives of property and equipment, realization of long-lived assets, impairment of goodwill, valuation of derivative instruments, deferred income taxes, unrealized tax positions, measurement of digital assets and related receivables and loss contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications have no effect on the reported financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
 The impact on any prior period disclosures were immaterial.
Segment Information

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), or decision–making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company’s CODM group is composed of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The Company operates as 
one
 operating segment and uses net income as measures of profit or loss on a consolidated basis in making decisions regarding resource allocation and performance assessment. Additionally, the Company’s CODM regularly reviews the Company’s expenses on a consolidated basis. The financial metrics used by the CODM help make key operating decisions, such as determination of digital asset purchases and significant acquisitions and allocation of budget between cost of revenues, general and administrative and research and development expenses.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments and other short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash and cash equivalent balances at financial institutions that are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). During March 2023, the Company began to participate, to the extent practicable, in insured cash sweep programs which “sweep” its deposits across multiple FDIC insured accounts, each with deposits of no more than $250.0 thousand. As of December 31, 2024, substantially all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were FDIC insured.
Restricted Cash

Restricted cash as of 
December 31, 2024
 principally represented those cash balances that support commercial letters of credit and are restricted from withdrawal.
Digital Assets

On July 25, 2024, the Company adopted a full holding onto bitcoin (“HODL”) approach towards its bitcoin treasury policy, retaining all bitcoin mined in its operations, and may periodically make strategic open market purchases of bitcoin. As a result, bitcoin digital assets are included in non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets due to the Company’s intent to retain and hold bitcoin. Kaspa digital assets held with the intent to fund operating expenses are included in current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, digital assets loaned and collateralized were reported as “Digital assets - receivable, net” at December 31, 2024 and classified as long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as it is the Company’s intent to maintain the loaned and collateralized bitcoin consistent with its HODL policy. Proceeds from the sale of digital assets are included within investing activities in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Following the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-08, 
Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets
, effective January 1, 2023, the Company measures digital assets at fair value with changes recognized in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company tracks its cost basis of digital assets by-wallet in accordance with the first-in-first-out method of accounting. Refer to Note 5 – Digital Assets, for further information.
Digital Assets - Receivable, net
The Company lends digital assets to counterparties under fixed term loans. In addition, the Company pledged bitcoin as collateral for a line of credit. Digital asset receivables that do not have a prespecified maturity date are repayable at the option of the Company, and the borrower may repay at any time, without penalty or premium. While the loan is outstanding, the borrower has the right and the ability to use the digital assets at its discretion, including the ability to sell or pledge the borrowed digital assets to third parties. At the conclusion of the loan, the borrower is obligated to return the same type and quantity of digital assets as those lent by the Company.
The digital asset receivables are initially measured upon transfer at fair value and subsequently remeasured at fair value each reporting period. The changes in fair value is recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, in accordance with ASC 2023-08. A loan fee is accrued daily based on the amount owing, paid on a monthly basis consistent with each loan’s terms.
The digital asset receivable balance is evaluated for possible credit losses, in accordance with ASC 326 - 
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
 (“ASC 326”). The allowance for credit losses on digital assets receivables under the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model is determined by utilizing the profitability of default (“PD”) loss given default (“LGD”) approach. In order to apply the PD LGD approach, management considers the remaining expected life of the loans and forecasts of future economic conditions. Allowance for credit losses are included in “Other non-operating income (loss)” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to Note 6 - Digital Assets - Receivable, Net for further information.

Other Receivable

The Company acquired accounts receivable as a result of its acquisition of GC Data Center Acquisition on January 12, 2024, which consist of trade receivables. Refer to Note 3 - Acquisitions, for further information. The Company provides an allowance for credit losses equal to the estimated uncollectible amounts, based on historical and customer specific experience and current economic and market conditions.
 The allowance for credit losses was $
8.6
 million as of December 31, 2024.
Derivatives

The Company enters into derivative contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations in the price of bitcoin and energy costs and not for any other purpose. In addition, the Company evaluates its financing and service arrangements to determine whether certain arrangements contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 815 - 
Derivatives and Hedging
. Embedded derivatives that are required to be bifurcated from the host instrument or arrangement are accounted for and valued as separate financial instruments. There were 
no
 embedded derivatives requiring separation from the host instrument as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
The Company does not elect to designate derivatives as hedges for accounting purposes and as such, records derivatives at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value and settlements recognized in earnings. The Company classifies derivative assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as current or non-current based on whether settlement of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date of the Balance Sheets and for derivatives with multiple settlements, based on the term of the contract. 
Bitcoin Derivatives
From time to time the Company enters into derivative contracts to mitigate bitcoin market pricing volatility risk. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a $
0.6
 million loss on derivatives as a non-operating charge on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, all settled through cash payments. There were various derivative instruments to mitigate bitcoin market pricing volatility risk outstanding as of December 31, 2024, and 
no
 derivatives instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2023.
Energy Derivatives
The Company acquired a commodity swap contract as a result of its acquisition of GC Data Center Acquisition on January 12, 2024, refer to Note 3 - Acquisitions, for further information. The commodity swap contract hedges price variability in electricity purchases and expires on December 31, 2027. The commodity swap contract meets the definition of a derivative due to terms that provide for net settlement. As of December 31, 2024, the estimated fair value of the Company’s derivative asset instrument was $
8.9
 million, estimated using observable market-based inputs classified under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value include the discount rate and electricity forward curves.
 Accordingly, the Company records the “
Change in fair value of derivative instrument
” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment, as applicable. Property and equipment acquired through business combinations are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company’s property and equipment is primarily composed of digital asset mining rigs, which are largely homogeneous and have approximately the same useful lives. Accordingly, the Company utilizes the group method of depreciation for its digital asset mining rigs. The Company will update the estimated useful lives of its digital asset mining server group periodically if information on the operations of the mining equipment indicates changes are required. The Company will assess and adjust the estimated useful lives of its mining equipment when there are indicators that the productivity of the mining assets is longer or shorter than the assigned estimated useful lives.

Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not subject to amortization, and instead, assessed for impairment annually at the end of each fiscal year, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in accordance with ASC 350
 - Intangibles - Goodwill and Other
. 
The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, in which case a quantitative impairment test is not required. 
As provided for by ASU 2017-04, 
Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment
, the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired. An impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit over its fair value up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Income tax effects from any tax-deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit are considered when measuring the goodwill impairment loss, if applicable.
Finite-Lived Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are recorded at cost less any accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired through business combinations are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. 
Intangible assets with finite lives are comprised of customer relationships and intellectual property and are amortized over their estimated useful lives on an accelerated basis over the projected pattern of economic benefits, which range from 
two
 to 
three years
. Finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value has been reduced to less than its carrying amount.
Business Combinations
The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805 - 
Business Combinations
, by recognizing the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, measured at the acquisition date fair value. The determination of fair value involves assumptions, estimates and judgments. The initial allocation of the purchase price is considered preliminary and therefore subject to change until the end of the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net assets acquired. Contingent consideration is included within the purchase price and is initially recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Contingent consideration, classified as either an asset or a liability, is remeasured to fair value each reporting period, until the contingency is resolved. Changes in fair value of contingent consideration period-over-period are recognized in earnings. 
Acquisition related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.

Investments
Investments, which may be made from time-to-time for strategic reasons, are included in non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 9 - Investments, for further information.
Equity Method Investments
The Company accounts for investments in which it owns between 20% and 50% of the common stock and has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the investee using the equity method of accounting in accordance with ASC 323 - 
Equity Method Investments and Joint Ventures
. Under the equity method, an investor initially records its investment in the investee at cost and adjusts the carrying amount of its investment to recognize its proportionate share of the earnings or losses of the investee after the date of investment.

Other Investments
Investments in which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence and does not have readily determinable fair values, are recorded at cost minus impairment, plus or minus changes from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, in accordance with the measurement alternative described in ASC 321 - 
Investments – Equity Securities
. 
As part of the Company’s policy to maximize return on strategic investment opportunities, while preserving capital and limiting downside risk, the Company may at times enter into equity investments or Simple Agreements for Future Equity (“SAFE”). The nature and timing of the Company’s investments will depend on available capital at any particular time and the investment opportunities identified and available to the Company. However, the Company generally does not make investments for speculative purposes and does not intend to engage in the business of making investments.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception based on whether or not the Company has the right to control the asset during the contract period and other facts and circumstances. At lease inception, the Company determines the lease classification as either an operating or finance lease, with classification effecting the expense recognition on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For leases with terms longer than 12 months, a lease liability is recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets for the present value of its fixed minimum payment obligations over the lease term, including renewal extension options, and a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset equal to the initial lease liability is recorded, adjusted for any prepayments, indirect costs and lease incentives, as well as adjustments to reflect favorable or unfavorable terms of an acquired lease when compared to market terms at the time of an acquisition. Refer to Note 18 - Leases, for further information.
Stock-based Compensation

The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for awards to employees and non-employees based on the grant date fair value of the award and uses the graded-vesting method to recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period from the date of grant of the award for each separately vesting tranche. The Company classifies its stock-based compensation within “General and administration expenses” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as any portion of mining activities related to Cost of revenues is immaterial. Refer to Note 14 – Stockholders' Equity, for further information. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur and reverses compensation cost previously recognized in the period the award is forfeited.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets.

Revenues

The Company recognizes revenue under ASC 606 – 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
. The core principle of the revenue standard is that a reporting entity should recognize revenues to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Refer to Note 4 – Revenues, for further information.
Research and Development

Research and development costs consist primarily of contractor costs, equipment, supplies, personnel, and related expenses for research and development activities. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730 - 
Research and Development
, and are included in operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Research and development costs were $
13.2
 million, $
2.8
 million and $
0.1
 million, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 respectively.
Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is required to the extent any deferred tax assets may not be realizable.

ASC 740 - 
Income Taxes
, also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements

The Company continually assesses any new accounting pronouncements to determine their applicability. When it is determined that a new accounting pronouncement may affect the Company’s financial reporting, the Company undertakes an analysis to determine any required changes to its Consolidated Financial Statements and assures that there are proper controls in place to ascertain that the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements properly reflect the change.
In December 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2024-04,

Intangible assets were determined to meet the criterion for recognition apart from tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values of intangible assets were estimated based on various valuation techniques including the use of discounted cash flow analyses, and multi-period excess earnings valuation approaches, which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. These valuation inputs included estimates and assumptions about forecasted future cash flows, long-term revenue growth rates, and discount rates. The fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset was determined using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the excess earnings method and will be amortized on an accelerated basis over the projected pattern of economic benefits of approximately 
4
 years. As of December 31, 2024, the Company fully amortized customer relationships acquired for $

Step 3: Determine the transaction price;
•
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and
•
Step 5: Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation.
In order to identify the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, an entity must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify each promised good or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606’s definition of a “distinct” good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria are met:
•
The customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or service is capable of being distinct); and
•
The entity’s promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).
If a good or service is not distinct, the good or service is combined with other promised goods or services until a bundle of goods or services is identified that is distinct.
The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer. The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. When determining the transaction price, an entity must consider the effects of all of the following:
•
Variable consideration
•
Constraining estimates of variable consideration
•
The existence of a significant financing component in the contract
•
Noncash consideration
•
Consideration payable to a customer
Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized under the accounting contract will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.
The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis.
The transaction price allocated to each performance obligation is recognized when that performance obligation is satisfied, at a point in time or over time, as appropriate.
Application of the Five-Step Model to the Company’s Mining and Hosting Operations
The Company’s ongoing major or central operation is to provide bitcoin transaction verification services to the transaction requestor, in addition to the Bitcoin network through a Company-operated mining pool as the operator (“Operator”) (such activity, “mining”) and to provide a service of performing hash calculations to third-party pool operators alongside collectives of third-party bitcoin miners (such collectives, “mining pools”) as a participant (“Participant”).

On January 12, 2024, the Company acquired 
two
 operational bitcoin mining sites for the purpose of improving efficiencies and the scale of the Company’s mining operations. In addition, the Company acquired 
two
 bitcoin mining sites within the Arkon Acquisition on November 5, 2024, that provide hosting services to a single customer. The Company provides hosting services to institutional-scale crypto mining companies at these sites. The Company will not be taking on any new hosting services customers at these locations and will transition to self-mining at these sites as existing customer agreements expire or are terminated early. Refer to Note 3 - Acquisitions, for further information.

Refer to Note 3 - Acquisitions, for further information.
Mining Operator
As Operator, the Company provides transaction verification services to the transaction requestor, in addition to the Bitcoin network. Transaction verification services are an output of the Company’s ordinary activities; therefore, the Company views the transaction requestor as a customer and recognizes the transaction fees as revenue from contracts with customers under ASC 606. The Bitcoin network is not an entity such that it may not meet the definition of a customer; however, the Company has concluded that it is appropriate to apply ASC 606 by analogy to block rewards earned from the Bitcoin network. The Company is currently entitled to the block reward of 
3.125
 bitcoin, subsequent to the halving that occurred on April 19, 2024. Prior to the halving, the Company was entitled to the block reward of 
6.25
 bitcoin from each successful validation of a block. The Company is also entitled to the transaction fees paid by the transaction requester payable in bitcoin for each successful validation of a block. The Company assessed the following factors in the determination of the inception and duration of each individual contract to validate a block and satisfaction of its performance obligation as follows:
•
For each individual contract, the parties’ rights, the transaction price, and the payment terms are fixed and known as of the inception of each individual contract.
•
The transaction requestor and the Bitcoin network each have a unilateral enforceable right to terminate their respective contracts at any time without penalty.
•
For each of these respective contracts, contract inception and completion occur simultaneously upon block validation; that is, the contract begins upon, and the duration of the contract does not extend beyond, the validation of an individual blockchain transaction; and each respective contract contains a single performance obligation to perform a transaction validation service and this performance obligation is satisfied at the point-in-time when a block is successfully validated.
From September 2021 until May 2022, the Company engaged unrelated third-party mining enterprises (“pool participants”) to contribute hash calculations, and in exchange, remitted transaction fees and block rewards to pool participants on a pro rata basis according to each respective pool participant’s contributed hash calculations. The MaraPool wallet (owned by the Company as Operator) is recorded on the distributed ledger as the winner of proof of 
F-23
Table of 
Contents
work block rewards and assignee of all validations and, therefore, the transaction verifier of record. The pool participants entered into contracts with the Company as Operator; they did not directly enter into contracts with the network or the requester and were not known verifiers of the transactions assigned to the pool. As Operator, the Company delegated mining work to the pool participants utilizing software that algorithmically assigned work to each individual miner. By virtue of its selection and operation of the software, the Company as Operator controlled delegation of work to the pool participants. This indicated that the Company directed the mining pool participants to contribute their hash calculations to solve in areas that the Company designated. Therefore, the Company determined that it controlled the service of providing transaction verification services to the network and requester. Accordingly, the Company recorded all of the transaction fees and block rewards earned from transactions assigned to MaraPool as revenue, and the portion of the transaction fees and block rewards remitted to MaraPool participants as cost of revenues. 
In accordance with ASC 606-10-32-21, the Company measures the estimated fair value of the non-cash consideration (block reward and transaction fees) at contract inception, which is at the time the performance obligation to the requester and the network is fulfilled by successfully validating a block. The Company measures the non-cash consideration which is fixed as of the inception of each individual contract using the quoted spot rate for bitcoin determined using the Company’s primary trading platform for bitcoin at the time the Company successfully validates a block.
Expenses associated with providing bitcoin transaction verification services, such as hosting fees, electricity costs, and related fees are recorded as cost of revenues. Depreciation on digital asset mining equipment is also recorded as a component of cost of revenues.
Mining Participant
The Company participates in third-party operated mining pools. When the Company is a Participant in a third-party operated mining pool, the Company provides a service to perform hash calculations to the third-party pool operators. The Company considers the third-party mining pool operators to be its customers under Topic 606. Contract inception and the Company’s enforceable right to consideration begins when the Company commences providing hash calculation services to the mining pool operators. Each party to the contract has the unilateral right to terminate the contract at any time without any compensation to the other party for such termination. As such, the duration of a contract is less than a day and may be continuously renewed multiple times throughout the day. The implied renewal option is not a material right because there are no upfront or incremental fees in the initial contract and the terms, conditions, and compensation amount for the renewal options are at the then market rates.
The Company is entitled to non-cash compensation based on the pool operator’s payout model. The payout methodologies differ depending on the type of third-party operated mining pool. Full-Pay-Per-Share (“FPPS”) pools pay block rewards and transaction fees, less mining pool fees and Pay-Per-Share (“PPS”) pools pay block rewards less mining pool fees but no transaction fees. For FPPS and PPS pools, the Company is entitled to non-cash consideration even if a block is not successfully validated by the mining pool operators. Success-based mining pools pay a fractional share of the successfully mined block and transaction fees, reduced by pool operator expenses only if a block is successfully validated.
During 2024, the Company participated in FPPS mining pools. During 2023, the Company primarily participated in FPPS mining pools and, to a lesser extent, success-based mining pools. During 2022, the Company primarily participated in success-based mining pools and, to a lesser extent, PPS mining pools.
FPPS Mining Pools
The Company primarily participates in mining pools that use the FPPS payout method for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company is entitled to compensation once it begins to perform hash calculations for the pool operator in accordance with the operator’s specifications over a 24-hour period beginning midnight UTC and ending 23:59:59 UTC on a daily basis. The non-cash consideration that the Company is entitled to for providing hash calculations to the pool operator under the FPPS payout method is made up of block rewards and transaction fees less pool operator expenses determined as follows:
F-24
Table of 
Contents
•
The non-cash consideration in the form of a block reward is based on the total blocks expected to be generated on the Bitcoin network for the daily 24-hour period beginning midnight UTC and ending 23:59:59 UTC in accordance with the following formula: the daily hash calculations that the Company provided to the pool operator as a percent of the Bitcoin network’s implied hash calculations as determined by the network difficulty, multiplied by the total Bitcoin network block rewards expected to be generated for the same daily period.
•
The non-cash consideration in the form of transaction fees paid by transaction requestors is based on the share of total actual fees paid over the daily 24-hour period beginning midnight UTC and ending 23:59:59 UTC in accordance with the following formula: total actual transaction fees generated on the Bitcoin network during the 24-hour period as a percent of total block rewards the Bitcoin network actually generated during the same 24-hour period, multiplied by the block rewards the Company earned for the same 24-hour period noted above.
•
The block reward and transaction fees earned by the Company is reduced by mining pool fees charged by the operator for operating the pool based on a rate schedule per the mining pool contract. The mining pool fee is only incurred to the extent the Company performs hash calculations and generates revenue in accordance with the pool operator’s payout formula during the same 24-hour period beginning midnight UTC daily.
The above non-cash consideration is variable in accordance with paragraphs ASC 606-10-32-5 to 606-10-32-7, since the amount of block reward earned depends on the amount of hash calculations the Company performs; the amount of transaction fees the Company is entitled to depends on the actual Bitcoin network transaction fees over the same 24-hour period; and the operator fees for the same 24-hour period are variable since they are determined based on the total block rewards and transaction fees in accordance with the pool operator’s agreement. While the non-cash consideration is variable, the Company has the ability to estimate the variable consideration at contract inception with reasonable certainty without the risk of significant revenue reversal. The Company does not constrain this variable consideration because it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized from the contract will not occur when the uncertainty is subsequently resolved and recognizes the non-cash consideration on the same day that control is transferred, which is the same day as contract inception.
The Company measures the non-cash consideration based on the simple average daily spot rate of bitcoin determined using the Company’s primary trading platform for bitcoin over a 24-hour period beginning midnight UTC and ending 23:59:59 UTC on the day of contract inception. The Company recognizes non-cash consideration on the same day that control of the contracted service is transferred to the pool operator, which is the same day as the contract inception.
PPS Mining Pools
The Company participates in PPS pools that provide non-cash consideration similar to the FPPS pools except PPS pools do not include transaction fees, therefore, the non-cash consideration received by the Company is made up of block rewards less mining pool fees. While the non-cash consideration is variable, the Company has the ability to estimate the variable consideration at contract inception with reasonable certainty. The Company does not constrain this variable consideration because it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized from the contract will not occur when the uncertainty is subsequently resolved and recognizes the non-cash consideration on the same day that control is transferred, which is the same day as contract inception. 
The Company measures the non-cash consideration based on the simple average daily spot rate of bitcoin determined using the Company’s primary trading platform for bitcoin over a 24-hour period beginning midnight UTC and ending 23:59:59 UTC on the day of contract inception. The Company recognizes non-cash consideration on the same day that control of the contracted service is transferred to the pool operator, which is the same day as the contract inception.
Success-based Mining Pools
The Company also participates, to a lesser extent, in third-party mining pools that pay rewards only when the pool successfully validates a block. For these pools, the Company only earns a reward when the third-party pool 
F-25
Table of 
Contents
successfully mines a block and its reward is the fractional share of the successfully mined block and transaction fees, reduced by pool operator expenses, based on the proportion of hash calculations the Company performed for the mining pool operator to the total hash calculations performed by all mining pool participants in validating the block during the 24-hour period beginning at midnight UTC and ending 23:59:59 UTC daily. 
Contract inception and the Company’s enforceable right to consideration begins when the Company commences the performance of hash calculations for the mining pool operator. The non-cash consideration is variable in accordance with paragraphs ASC 606-10-32-5 to 606-10-32-7 as it depends on whether the third-party mining pool successfully validates a block during each 24-hour period. In addition, other inputs such as the amount of hash calculations and the Company’s fractional share of consideration earned by the pool operator also cause variability. The Company does not have the ability to estimate whether a block will be successfully validated with reasonable certainty at contract inception. The Company constrains the variable consideration at contract inception because it is not probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenue recognized from the contract will not occur when the uncertainty is subsequently resolved. Once a block is successfully validated, the constraint is lifted. The Company recognizes the non-cash consideration on the same day that control is transferred, which is the same day as contract inception.
The Company’s policy was to measure non-cash consideration based on the spot rate of bitcoin at the time the pool successfully validates a block, which was not in accordance with ASC 606-10-32-21 which requires measurement to coincide with contract inception. Additionally, this measurement was not consistent with the measurement of non-cash consideration for FPPS and PPS pools. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company corrected this error and changed its measurement of non-cash consideration to the simple average daily spot rate of bitcoin determined using the Company’s primary trading platform for bitcoin on the date of contract inception, which is the same day that control of the contracted service (hash calculations) is transferred to the pool operator. The change in measurement did not have a material impact to the results of operations for any of the periods presented.
Expenses associated with providing hash calculation services to third-party operated mining pools, such as hosting fees, electricity costs, and related fees, are recorded as cost of revenues. Depreciation on digital asset mining equipment is also recorded as a component of cost of revenues.
Hosting Services
The Company operates 
three
 bitcoin mining sites, which were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2024, that provide hosting services to institutional-scale crypto mining companies. Hosting services include colocation and managed services. Colocation services include providing mining companies with sheltered data center space, electrical power, cooling, and internet connectivity. Managed services generally include providing customers with technical support and maintenance services, in addition to colocation services. The Company will not be taking on any new hosting services customers and will transition acquired sites to self-mining as existing customer agreements expire or are terminated early. 
Colocation services revenue is recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the Company’s performance. Managed services revenue is recognized at a point-in-time as the control transfers to the customer, satisfying the performance obligation. The transaction price for colocation services is variable based on the consumption of energy and the managed services price is a fixed rate per miner basis. The Company recognizes hosting services revenue to the extent that a significant reversal of such revenue will not occur. Hosting services customers are generally invoiced in advance of the month in which the Company satisfies its performance obligation, and deferred revenue is recorded for any upfront payments received in advance of the Company’s performance. The monthly transaction price is generally variable based on the amount of megawatt hours (“MWh”) consumed by the customers equipment and when other monthly contracted services are performed. At the end of each month, the customer is billed for the actual amount owed for services performed. The Company recognizes revenue for hosting services under the right-to-invoice practical expedient in ASC 606-10-55-18, which allows for the recognition of revenue over time as the Company’s right-to-invoice for final payment corresponds directly with the value of services transferred to the customer to-date.
Expenses associated with providing hosting services are recorded as cost of revenues and depreciation on hosting equipment is recorded as a separate component of cost of revenues.

The digital asset receivables forementioned are initially recognized at fair value upon transfer and subsequently remeasured at fair value each reporting period. The changes in fair value are recognized as “Changes to digital assets - receivable, net” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company’s current estimate of the potential credit losses associated with the digital asset loan receivable and bitcoin provided as collateral to secure the $
200.0
 million line of credit. The credit loss is recorded as a valuation account, directly offsetting the Digital asset receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes to the allowance for credit losses on loans, based on quarterly analysis’, are recorded as provision for credit losses within “Other non-operating income (loss)” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The Company assesses the creditworthiness of our borrowers on a quarterly basis. For the purpose of determining the allowance for credit loss, financial assets with similar risk characteristics are pooled together. Our financial assets are aggregated by exposure term and assigned risk ratings. The Company considers credit ratings and several factors including the collateral and/or security of the Digital asset receivable, and are aligned with the ratings used by major credit ratings agencies.
Given the limited historical data related to digital asset receivables and incurred losses related to digital asset receivables, the Company chose to rely on external data to perform the calculation of expected credit losses. The Company utilized the profitability of default (“PD”) and loss given default (“LGD”) approach to estimate the allowance for credit loss. In order to apply the PD LGD approach, management considered the lifetime of the digital asset receivables, the reasonable and supportable forecast, and the PD LGD. 
As of December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a corresponding allowance for credit loss of $
8.4
 million, based on the PD LGD approach. There were 
no
 digital asset receivables outstanding or allowance for credit losses recorded as of December 31, 2023,

ADVANCES TO VENDORS AND DEPOSITS
The Company contracts with bitcoin mining equipment manufacturers to procure equipment necessary for the operation of its bitcoin mining operations. These agreements typically require a certain percentage of the value of the total order to be paid in advance at specific intervals, usually within several days of execution of a contract and periodically thereafter with final payments due prior to each shipment date. The Company accounts for these payments as “Advances to vendors” on the 
Consolidated
 Balance Sheets.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, such advances totaled approximately $
121.3
 million and $
95.6

NOTE 11 – 
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

The Company measures certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis. The Company uses a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, essentially an exit price, based on the highest and best use of the asset or liability. 
The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:

Level 1:
Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level 2:
Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data

Level 3:
Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity’s own assumptions

The carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, other receivables, deposits, prepaid expenses and other current assets, property and equipment, advances to vendors, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and legal reserve payable approximate their estimated fair market value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments. Additionally, the carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the Company’s term loan, operating lease liabilities and other long-term liabilities approximate fair value as the related interest rates approximate rates currently available to the Company.
Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement. The Company measures the fair value of its marketable securities and investments by taking into consideration valuations obtained from third-party pricing sources. The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models, including both income and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, to estimate fair value. These inputs included reported trades of and broker-dealer quotes on the same or similar securities, issuer credit spreads, benchmark securities and other observable inputs.
Recurring measurement of fair value

The following tables present information about the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the Company’s estimated level within the fair value hierarchy for each of those assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively:

INCOME TAXES

The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740 - 
Income Taxes
, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carry-forwards. ASC 740 additionally requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets.

Income tax expense (benefit) attributable to income from continuing operations was $
75.5
 million, $
16.4
 million and $(
24.2
) million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21% to pretax income from continuing operations as a result of the following:

The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023 was $
78.0
 million. There was a 
zero
 valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024, resulting in a decrease of the total valuation allowance of $
78.0
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024.

For the year ended 
December 31, 2024
, the Company concluded, based upon all available evidence, it was more likely than not that it would have sufficient future taxable income to realize the Company’s federal and state deferred tax assets. As a result, the Company is releasing the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that are supported by reversing deferred tax liabilities.

At 
December 31, 2024
, the Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $
612.8
 million, which are available to offset future taxable income. In addition, the Company has interest carryforwards of $

The Company has established a reserve against its federal research and development tax credits generated in 2024 and previous years. The Company has also established a reserve related to its executive compensation deduction limitation in 2022.

As of December 31, 2024, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $
5.9
 million, all of which was offset against deferred tax assets. If the unrecognized tax benefits were recognized as of December 31, 2024, there would be a $
5.9
 million favorable impact that would affect the effective rate on income from continuing operations. The Company did 
no
t accrue either interest or penalties for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company does not currently expect any of its remaining unrecognized tax benefits to be recognized in the next twelve months.

The Company files federal and state income tax returns. The 2020-2023 tax years generally remain subject to examination by the IRS and various state taxing authorities, although the Company is not currently under examination in any jurisdiction.

NOTE 13 – 
NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE

Net income (loss) per share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260 - 
Earnings Per Share
. Basic income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. For the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded net income (loss) and as such, the Company calculated the impact of dilutive common stock equivalents in determining diluted earnings per share.

Performance-based Restricted Stock Units
The Company granted performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) on May 1, 2024, and subsequently to new hires and for promotions. These awards generally vest over a 
four-year
 period from the date of grant. Awards are issued in the form of RSUs and are granted pursuant to the 2018 Plan. The number of PSUs that are subject to vest is directly correlated with the Company’s achievements of a pre-determined metric relating to total stockholder return (“TSR”) for the period from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024 (the “Performance Period”).
Based on the Company’s TSR performance relative to the peer group for the Performance Period, the PSU awards will vest between 
0
% to 
200
% of the target amount over an approximate 
four-year
 period. Determination regarding the Company’s performance relative to the TSR metric will establish the maximum number of shares that are subject

to vesting pursuant to the PSU awards. Once determined, (i) 
25
% of the PSU awards will vest on January 31, 2025, and (ii) the balance of the awards will vest in 12 equal calendar quarters (with 
6.25
% of the shares vesting each quarter). The Company measures the fair value of the PSUs at the grant date using the Monte Carlo simulation model.
The Monte Carlo simulation model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including risk-free interest rate, expected term, expected stock price volatility, market capitalization of peer group, and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities as of the grant date. Expected term is consistent with the Performance Period of the awards. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over the estimated expected life. The Company does not pay a dividend, therefore, the dividend yield is assumed to be zero.
During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company revised the peer group for its PSUs to ensure a relevant benchmark for performance evaluation and modified the vesting date of the first tranche to December 31, 2024. This modification resulted in the recognition of $
26.1
 million of incremental expense in the quarter ended December 31, 2024. The remaining $
78.2
 million of incremental expense will be recognized over the requisite service period.
A summary of the Company’s PSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2024, is as follows:

Ho v. Marathon

On January 14, 2021, plaintiff Michael Ho (“Ho”) filed a civil complaint (the “Complaint”) in which he alleged, among other things, that the Company breached the terms of a non-disclosure agreement, profited from commercially sensitive information he shared with the Company, and refused to compensate him for his role in securing the Company’s acquisition of an energy supplier. The Complaint initially alleged 
six
 causes of action: (1) breach of written contract, (2) breach of implied contract, (3) quasi-contract, (4) services rendered, (5) intentional interference with prospective economic relations, and (6) negligent interference with prospective economic relations. On February 22, 2021, the Company responded to the Complaint with a general denial of the claims and asserted certain affirmative defenses. On February 25, 2021, the Company removed the action to the United States District Court in the Central District of California (the “Court”). The Company subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to each of the causes of action. As a result of the Court’s summary judgment ruling and Ho’s voluntary dismissal of certain claims, the only remaining cause of action at the time of verdict was breach of written contract.
On July 8, 2024, the Court commenced a jury trial with respect to the sole remaining claim. On July 18, 2024, the jury determined that the Company had breached the non-disclosure agreement and returned a verdict in the amount of $
138.8
 million. On September 18, 2024, the Court entered a judgment of the same amount, plus post-judgment interest. The Company has not paid any portion of the award. On October 16, 2024, the Company filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law (or in the alternative for a new trial and remittitur), which seeks to overturn, or at a minimum significantly reduce, the damage award. Also on October 16, 2024, the Company filed a motion to correct the post-judgment interest rate set forth in the judgment, and Ho filed a motion requesting an award of pre-judgment interest. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company acquired a surety bond for the amount owing. The

Company intends to defend its positions vigorously and assert its various legal arguments to challenge both the verdict and the amount of the award. The Court has scheduled a hearing on March 28, 2025 related to the aforementioned motions filed by the Company and Ho.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Management’s Conclusions Regarding Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
In our prior 10-K for the fiscal year ended as of December 31, 2023, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the ineffective design or implementation of IT general controls or an alternative key manual control to prevent or detect material misstatements in revenue. 
During the current fiscal year, we completed the implementation and testing of the remediation measures designed to address this material weakness. These measures included (a) utilizing third-party software tools to calculate revenue earned and performing reasonableness tests on the input data used by such software tools, (b) performing a revenue analytic control that compares the theoretical BTC earned to the actual BTC earned for reasonableness, and (c) ensuring that our vendors used in the controls above are publishing reliable and appropriate System and Organization Controls (“SOC”) reports so that the information being used in the performance of related controls above are reliable and accurate.
We have performed testing to evaluate the operating effectiveness of these remediation measures. Based on the results of our testing, we have concluded that the material weakness related to the ineffective design or implementation of IT general controls or an alternative key manual control to prevent or detect material misstatements in revenue has been remediated as of December 31, 2024.
Our management excluded from its assessment of effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the internal controls of our recently acquired significant subsidiaries, Arkon Energy Hannibal LLC, Crown56 LLC, GC Data Center Equity Holdings, LLC, GC Data Center Granbury LLC, GC Data Center Holdings LLC, GC Data Center Kearney LLC and MARA Garden City LLC. We have included the financial results of these subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Total assets and total revenues related to these entities that were excluded from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting collectively represented approximately 6.2% and 4.8% of our consolidated total assets and total revenue as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, respectively. Our management will include the internal controls of these entities in its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2025.
As of December 31, 2024, we believe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting.

Table of 
Contents
As part of our ongoing program to implement changes and further improve our internal controls and in conjunction with is Code of Ethics, our independent directors have been working with management to include protocols and measures aimed at ensuring quality of our internal controls. Among those measures is the implementation of a whistle blower hotline, which allows third parties to anonymously report noncompliant activity. The hotline may be accessed as follows:

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
Other than the changes in connection with our implementation of the material weakness remediation plan discussed above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a‑15(f) or 15d‑15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of MARA Holdings, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited MARA Holdings, Inc.’s (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013. In our opinion, the Company

maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and the related consolidated statements of operations, equity, and cash flows and the related notes for each of the three years in the period ended

December 31, 2024

of the Company, and our report dated March 3, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion

on those financial statements.
Explanatory Paragraph – Excluded Subsidiaries 
As described in “Management Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting”, management has excluded its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Arkon Energy Hannibal LLC, Crown56 LLC, GC Data Center Equity Holdings, LLC, GC Data Center Granbury LLC, GC Data Center Holdings LLC, GC Data Center Kearney LLC and MARA Garden City LLC, from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 because these entities were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2024. We have also excluded Arkon Energy Hannibal LLC, Crown56 LLC, GC Data Center Equity Holdings, LLC, GC Data Center Granbury LLC, GC Data Center Holdings LLC, GC Data Center Kearney LLC and MARA Garden City LLC from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. These subsidiaries’ combined total assets and total revenues represent approximately 6.2% and 4.8%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31,2024.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying “Management Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.” Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable 
56
Table of 
Contents
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
