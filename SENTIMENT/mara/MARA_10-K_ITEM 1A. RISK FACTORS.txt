Risks Related to Our Business
Bitcoin price volatility may affect our ability to effectively manage our growth plans and profitability.
The market price of bitcoin is extremely volatile, and in fiscal 2024 the price range of bitcoin was between approximately $39,000 and $106,000. The cost to mine a bitcoin is independent of the then current price of bitcoin, so when bitcoin prices are low, the cost per coin to mine may consume much of our available cash, limiting our ability to invest in expansion, upgrade mining equipment and infrastructure or fund other strategic initiatives. Additionally, because our revenue is primarily derived from mining bitcoin, our profitability fluctuates in direct correlation with bitcoin price movements. A decrease in bitcoin’s price results in a corresponding decrease in the value of the bitcoin we mine, reducing our revenues and profitability on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Given the volatility of bitcoin prices, we are unable to accurately predict our future growth trajectory or reliably forecast our revenue and profitability for any given reporting period. Our ability to expand our operations depends on our assumptions regarding bitcoin’s future price. If those assumptions are incorrect, and bitcoin prices fail to reach or sustain levels 
14
Table of 
Contents
high enough to justify our capital expenditures, we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to maintain profitability or execute our growth strategy, which could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Regulatory, commercial and technical uncertainties may influence bitcoin prices.
The market price of bitcoin is subject to numerous uncertainties, including evolving regulatory frameworks, commercial adoption trends and technical risks, any of which could negatively impact its value. Regulatory treatment of digital assets remains uncertain in various jurisdictions, and new regulations, enforcement actions, or interpretations by governmental authorities could diminish bitcoin’s appeal, restrict its use or otherwise depress its market price.
Beyond regulation, bitcoin’s price is influenced by factors such as:
•
public perception and media coverage of bitcoin and digital assets;
•
accessibility and convenience of purchasing, holding and transacting with bitcoin;
•
institutional demand for bitcoin as an asset class;
•
consumer adoption of bitcoin for everyday transactions; and
•
emergence of competing digital assets with potentially superior functionality, scalability or regulatory compliance.
Even if bitcoin adoption increases in the short term, there is no guarantee that this growth will be sustained. Since bitcoin exists solely as digital records on the Bitcoin blockchain, its value is also susceptible to technical risks, including:
•
a decrease in miner incentives due to declining block rewards and transaction fees;
•
security vulnerabilities, such as potential network attacks or software exploits;
•
forks or changes to the Bitcoin protocol that may split the network or cause instability; and
•
developments in mathematics or technology, including in digital computing, algebraic geometry and quantum computing, that could result in the cryptography used by the Bitcoin blockchain becoming insecure or ineffective.
Additionally, bitcoin’s liquidity could be adversely affected if financial institutions, payment processors or market makers withdraw their support for bitcoin-related services due to regulatory pressure, reputational concerns or operational risks. If any of these risks materialize, they could negatively impact bitcoin’s market price, which, in turn, would adversely affect our business and financial condition.
Failure to increase our hashrate may reduce our competitiveness and negatively impact our financial performance.
Our ability to earn bitcoin rewards is directly proportional to our mining power, or hashrate, relative to the total hashrate of the Bitcoin network. As more miners enter the network and deploy more powerful mining equipment, the global hashrate increases, making it more difficult to successfully mine bitcoin. To remain competitive, we must continuously invest in expanding our hashrate by acquiring new, more efficient mining hardware. However, as demand for mining equipment grows, the cost of acquiring and deploying new miners increases, which could limit our ability to scale. If we are unable to access capital to acquire additional miners, our hashrate may stagnate and we may fall behind our competitors. If we fail to increase our hashrate at a pace that keeps up with network difficulty growth, our share of total bitcoin mining rewards will decline, reducing our revenue and negatively impacting our financial performance.
Our HODL strategy exposes us to market volatility and liquidity risks.
In the third quarter of 2024, we adopted a HODL strategy whereby we retain all bitcoin mined in our operations or purchased in the open market, rather than selling bitcoin to generate revenue. In the second half of 2024, we raised approximately $2.2 billion, primarily through the issuance of the 2024 Convertible Notes, to acquire bitcoin as part of our HODL strategy. As a result, our financial condition is highly dependent on the market price of bitcoin, which historically has been volatile and subject to fluctuations due to regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, 
15
Table of 
Contents
technological advancements, security incidents, market speculation and adoption trends. If the price of bitcoin declines significantly or remains low for an extended period, the value of our holdings could decrease materially, affecting our balance sheet and liquidity. Since we do not generate significant revenue from other business activities, a prolonged downturn in bitcoin’s price could make it difficult to cover operational expenses, service debt or fund strategic initiatives. Additionally, if we need to sell bitcoin to meet financial obligations, we could face liquidity constraints, unfavorable market conditions or regulatory restrictions that limit our ability to do so. Any of these factors could adversely affect our financial stability and business prospects. While we believe our HODL strategy will create long-term value, there is no guarantee that it will generate the returns we expect or that we will be able to meet our obligations under outstanding convertible notes without negatively impacting our financial condition.
Significant disruptions in the cryptocurrency markets, like those in late 2022, could materially impair the value of our mining rigs, and prolonged low bitcoin prices could force us to idle mining rigs.
Major disruptions in the cryptocurrency market, such as those in late 2022, could significantly impact the value of our mining equipment. In the fourth quarter of 2022, bitcoin’s price fell from nearly $21,500 to a low of approximately $15,500. This decline, combined with negative market sentiment following the collapse of FTX Trading Ltd. in November 2022 and the bankruptcies and restructurings of multiple digital asset companies, caused a material decline in the fair value of our mining rigs and deposits for future mining rig purchases. As a result, we recorded a $332.9 million impairment charge for the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Similar market downturns in the future could force us to record further impairments on our current and future assets, which could negatively impact our financial condition.
Our ability to operate profitably depends heavily on bitcoin prices. If bitcoin’s price drops and remains low for an extended period, we may have to consider whether it is financially viable to continue operating certain mining rigs until prices recover. There is a theoretical minimum bitcoin price below which bitcoin mining becomes uneconomical, particularly when operating costs exceed mining revenue. However, determining this threshold is complex due to the constantly changing variables involved. We operate multiple mining sites with different hosting and electricity costs, each governed by separate contract structures. If market conditions make mining unprofitable across multiple sites, we may need to shut down or scale back operations, which could reduce our revenues and negatively impact our financial performance.
The adoption and long-term viability of digital asset networks is uncertain, and a decline in their growth or acceptance could negatively impact our business and the value of our stock.
Bitcoin and other digital assets are part of a new and rapidly evolving industry. The long-term growth and viability of digital assets depend on multiple factors, including:
•
continued global adoption and usage of bitcoin and other digital assets;
•
government regulations that impact digital asset transactions and network operations;
•
the development and maintenance of Bitcoin’s open-source software protocol;
•
shifting consumer demographics, preferences and payment habits;
•
the availability and popularity of alternative payment methods, including improved fiat currency solutions;
•
economic conditions and the regulatory environment for digital assets; and
•
regulatory scrutiny and associated compliance costs.
If bitcoin adoption stagnates or declines, demand for bitcoin could weaken, which could negatively affect our business. A prolonged lack of growth in bitcoin adoption could reduce market confidence, leading to lower trading volumes and diminished liquidity. Additionally, bitcoin’s price volatility undermines its role as a medium of exchange, as retailers are less likely to accept it as a form of payment. Marketplace acceptance of bitcoin as a medium of exchange and payment method may remain low. The relative lack of acceptance of bitcoin in the retail and commercial marketplace, or a reduction of such use, limits the ability of end users to use bitcoin to pay for goods and services.
Further, as block rewards decrease, higher transaction fees may be required to incentivize miners, potentially reducing bitcoin adoption and value. In order to incentivize miners to continue to contribute processing power to any digital asset network, such network may either formally or informally transition from a set reward to transaction fees earned upon solving for a block. This transition could be accomplished either by miners independently electing to 
16
Table of 
Contents
record in the blocks they solve only those transactions that include payment of a transaction fee or by the digital asset network adopting software upgrades that require the payment of a minimum transaction fee for all transactions. If transaction fees paid for digital asset transactions become too high, the marketplace may be reluctant to accept digital assets as a means of payment and existing users may be motivated to switch from one digital asset to another digital asset or back to fiat currency. A decline in bitcoin transactions and adoption could reduce demand, negatively impacting bitcoin’s price and affecting the value of our bitcoin holdings.
We face risks related to technological obsolescence, vulnerability of the global supply chain for cryptocurrency hardware, potential trade restrictions and difficulty in obtaining new hardware, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.
Bitcoin mining hardware experiences wear and tear over time, requiring periodic repairs or replacement to maintain efficiency. Additionally, as mining technology evolves, we must invest in newer, more efficient mining equipment to remain competitive, which requires significant capital expenditures.
Further, we have faced complications related to the import of mining equipment in the past and may face such complications in the future. The global supply of miners is unpredictable and presently heavily dependent on manufacturers based in China. Geopolitical matters, including the relationship between the United States and other countries and trade restrictions and tariffs (or the threat of trade restrictions or tariffs), may impact our ability to import miners or other equipment necessary for our operations. Restrictions or bans on mining equipment from China, whether due to trade restrictions, national security concerns or geopolitical tensions, could disrupt our supply chain, increase equipment costs and delay our growth plans.
In addition, officials of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency (“CBP”) have broad discretion regarding products imported into the United States, and the CBP has on occasion detained or seized imported miners and other equipment necessary to the operation of our miners, which has resulted in significant costs to us. If our imported mining equipment is detained or seized in the future, we may not be able to obtain adequate replacement parts for our existing miners and other equipment or obtain additional miners and other equipment from manufacturers on a timely basis or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
We may experience liquidity constraints and need additional capital, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.
Liquidity risk is the possibility that we will be unable to meet our financial obligations as they come due. To manage this risk, we use a planning and budgeting process to estimate the funds needed for ongoing operations and growth initiatives. In 2024, we settled our obligations using cash, cash equivalents and net proceeds from our offerings of the 2024 Convertible Notes and stock sales pursuant to our at-the-market offerings. Additionally, in October 2024, we secured a $200.0 million line of credit through master lending agreements with a consortium of lenders. This line of credit requires digital asset collateral, but since these agreements are uncommitted, we cannot guarantee access to funds on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Further, if bitcoin’s price drops significantly, we may face margin calls on our borrowings, requiring us to post additional collateral or risk liquidation of collateralized bitcoin.
We expect that we will need to raise additional capital to expand our operations, pursue our growth strategy and respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements. We may seek but fail to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all, which could impair our growth and adversely affect our existing operations. Raising capital through equity financing could dilute existing stockholders and reduce the value of their investment. Debt financing, on the other hand, could impose restrictive terms, prioritize creditors over stockholders or require us to maintain liquidity levels or financial ratios that may not align with our business needs or be in the best interest of our stockholders.
Our bitcoin lending arrangements expose us to risks of borrower default, operational failures and cybersecurity threats.
From time to time, we generate income through bitcoin lending, which carries significant risks. The volatility of bitcoin increases the likelihood that borrowers may default due to market downturns, liquidity crises, fraud or other financial distress. Because our bitcoin lending arrangements are unsecured, they rank below secured debt in a 
17
Table of 
Contents
borrower’s capital structure. If a borrower becomes insolvent, we may be unable to recover the loaned bitcoin, leading to substantial financial losses.
Additionally, digital asset lending platforms are vulnerable to operational and cybersecurity risks. Technical failures, software bugs or system outages could disrupt lending activities, delay transactions or result in inaccurate record-keeping. Cybersecurity threats, including hacking, phishing and other malicious attacks, pose further risks, potentially leading to the loss, theft or misappropriation of our loaned bitcoin. A successful cyberattack or security breach could materially and adversely impact our financial position, reputation and ability to conduct future lending activities.
The U.S. political and economic environment could materially impact our business operations and financial performance, and uncertainty surrounding the potential legal, regulatory and policy changes by the new U.S. presidential administration may directly affect us and the global economy.
Changes in U.S. political leadership and economic policies may create uncertainty that materially affects our business and financial performance. Shifts in legal, regulatory, and trade policies, particularly under a new presidential administration, could disrupt our operations and long-term strategy.
For example, if the U.S. government establishes a strategic bitcoin reserve, large-scale purchases could create price volatility or artificial price suppression, making our mining operations less profitable. Conversely, slow or no action in creating such a reserve could limit institutional adoption and negatively impact bitcoin’s value, which could also harm our financial condition. Additionally, increased government influence over the Bitcoin network could affect mining difficulty, transaction processing, and other technical aspects, further impacting our business.
We also face risks from trade policy changes, including tariffs and restrictions on imports of mining equipment. The current administration has imposed, and may continue to impose, tariffs on imports from key manufacturing regions, increasing costs and disrupting supply chains.
The scope and timing of potential policy changes remain uncertain, making it difficult to plan for or mitigate these risks. Any such changes could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We have engaged in, and may continue to engage in, strategic acquisitions and other transactions that could disrupt our business, dilute our stockholders, strain our financial resources and harm our operating results.
As part of our growth strategy, we have pursued strategic transactions, including acquiring companies, miners and data centers. In the future, we may seek additional opportunities to expand our mining operations, including purchasing miners, data centers and other facilities, potentially from companies in financial distress. Our ability to grow through acquisitions depends on several factors, including the availability of suitable opportunities at acceptable costs, our ability to compete effectively to attract those opportunities and access to financing.
Acquisitions may require us to issue common stock, thereby diluting existing stockholders, or take on liabilities from acquired businesses. They may also result in recording goodwill and intangible assets that require regular impairment testing, which could lead to periodic write-downs. Additionally, acquisitions often involve significant costs, including integration expenses, restructuring charges and potential litigation risks.
Even when successful, acquisitions and expansions may take considerable time to deliver anticipated benefits, if at all. Integrating new businesses, technologies, and personnel can be complex and may divert management’s attention from daily operations. We may also face liabilities related to a target company’s past operations. Entering new markets where we have little experience could pose additional challenges, particularly if competitors have stronger market positions. Furthermore, we may struggle to generate sufficient revenue to justify acquisition costs, and the integration process could disrupt relationships with employees, suppliers and other stakeholders.
Further, we may not be able to pursue our current acquisition strategy in the future. Beyond bitcoin mining and related acquisitions, we have explored, and may continue to explore, opportunities in adjacent or complementary businesses as market conditions allow. These ventures may carry similar risks, including operational and financial challenges, and there is no guarantee they will provide the expected benefits in a timely manner, if at all.

Geopolitical and economic crises could lead to increased uncertainty, large-scale selloffs of digital assets and a decline in bitcoin’s value, negatively impacting our business and stock price.
Bitcoin is an alternative to fiat currencies that are backed by central governments, but its value is highly dependent on supply and demand. It is unclear how global geopolitical and economic crises will affect the adoption and valuation of digital assets. However, such crises may lead to large-scale acquisitions or sales of digital assets, causing significant price volatility. A large-scale selloff of bitcoin could decrease its value, directly affecting our business and the price of our common stock. Additionally, broader macroeconomic instability, inflation and regulatory uncertainty could impact our ability to conduct business efficiently and profitably. A significant decline in bitcoin’s value due to economic or geopolitical factors could negatively affect our financial condition.
The lack of legal recourse and insurance for our digital assets increases the risk of total loss in the event of theft or destruction.
Our digital assets are not insured against theft, loss or destruction. If an event occurs where we lose our digital assets, whether due to cyberattacks, fraud or other malicious activities, we may not have any viable legal recourse or ability to recover the lost assets. Unlike funds held in insured banking institutions, our digital assets are not protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. If our digital assets are lost under circumstances that render another party liable, there is no guarantee that the responsible party will have the financial resources to compensate us. As a result, we and our stockholders could face significant financial losses.
The open-source structure of the Bitcoin network exposes us to risks related to software development, security vulnerabilities and potential disruptions.
Digital asset networks are open-source projects and, although there is an influential group of leaders in, for example, the Bitcoin network community known as the “Core Developers,” there is no official developer or group of developers that formally controls the Bitcoin network. As an open-source project, Bitcoin is not represented by an official organization or authority. The Bitcoin network protocol is not sold, and contributors generally are not compensated for maintaining and updating the Bitcoin network protocol. Without guaranteed financial incentives, there may be insufficient resources to address emerging issues, upgrade security or implement necessary improvements in a timely manner. If the Bitcoin network’s software is not properly maintained or developed, it could become vulnerable to security threats, operational inefficiencies and reduced trust, all of which could negatively impact bitcoin’s long-term viability and our business.
Bitcoin network forks, where the blockchain splits into two separate networks, could cause disruptions and negatively impact our business.
Since the Bitcoin network is an open-source project, any individual can download the Bitcoin network software and make any desired modifications, which are proposed to users and miners on the Bitcoin network through software downloads and upgrades and typically posted to the Bitcoin development forum on GitHub.com. A substantial majority of miners and Bitcoin users must consent to those software modifications by downloading the altered software or upgrade that implements the changes. Otherwise, the changes do not become a part of the Bitcoin network. 
Since the Bitcoin network’s inception, changes to the network have been accepted by the vast majority of users and miners, ensuring that the network remains a coherent economic system. However, a developer or group of developers could propose a modification to the Bitcoin network that is not accepted by a vast majority of miners and users, but that is nonetheless accepted by a substantial population of participants in the Bitcoin network. In such a case, and if the modification is material or not compatible with the prior version of Bitcoin network software, a fork in the blockchain could develop and two separate Bitcoin networks could result with one running the pre-modification software program and the other running the modified version (i.e., a second “Bitcoin” network). 
Historically, the Bitcoin community has worked to merge forked blockchains, but a prolonged or unresolved split could create confusion, disrupt the network and affect bitcoin’s stability. A fork could decrease confidence in bitcoin, negatively impacting its price and, in turn, our business and stock value.

Widespread delays in the recording of transactions could erode confidence in the Bitcoin network and negatively impact our business.
To the extent that any miners cease to record transactions in solved blocks, such transactions will not be recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain, until a block is solved by a miner who does not require the payment of transaction fees. Currently, there are no known incentives for miners to actively not record transactions in solved blocks. However, to the extent that any such incentives arise (e.g., a collective movement among miners or one or more mining pools forcing blockchain users to pay transaction fees as a substitute for or in addition to the award of new bitcoin upon the solving of a block), actions of miners solving a significant number of blocks could delay the recording and confirmation of transactions on the blockchain. Widespread delays could increase the risk of “double-spending” (i.e., spending the same digital assets in more than one transaction), reduce trust in the network, and negatively impact bitcoin’s adoption and price. This could, in turn, affect the value of our bitcoin holdings and our financial performance.
Our reliance on third-party mining pools for a portion of our mining revenue exposes us to operational and financial risks.
While we rely largely on our internal mining pool, we additionally rely on external open-access mining pools to receive certain mining rewards and fees from the Bitcoin network. External pools have the sole discretion to modify the terms of our agreement at any time, and, therefore, our future rights and relationship with such pools may change.
In general, mining pools allow miners to combine their computing and processing power, increasing their chances of solving a block and getting rewarded by the Bitcoin network. The rewards are distributed by the pool operator proportionally to our contribution to the pool’s overall mining power. Should any external pool’s operator systems suffer downtime due to cyber-attacks, software failures or operational issues, our ability to mine and receive revenue would be negatively impacted. Furthermore, while we receive daily reports from the external pools detailing the total processing power provided to the pool and the proportion of that total processing power we provided to determine the distribution of rewards to us, we are dependent on the accuracy of each such pool’s recordkeeping. We have minimal recourse against external pool operators if we determine the proportion of the reward paid out to us by the mining pool operator is incorrect, aside from leaving the pools. If we cannot consistently obtain accurate proportionate rewards, our business and financial performance could suffer.
A 51% attack on the Bitcoin network could undermine security and market confidence.
The security of the Bitcoin network relies on its decentralized nature, which makes it difficult for any single entity to control a majority of the network’s mining power. However, if a malicious actor or coordinated group were to gain control of more than 50% of the total hashrate, a scenario known as a “51% attack,” they could theoretically manipulate the network by:
•
reversing previously confirmed transactions, enabling double-spending of bitcoin;
•
preventing new transactions from being confirmed, effectively halting the network; and
•
excluding or modifying transactions, undermining the trustworthiness of the blockchain.
A 51% attack could occur through several mechanisms, including large-scale mining operations, through which a single entity invests in expansive mining facilities with enough computing power to control the majority of the network; mining pool dominance, in which mining pool becomes so large that it collectively controls more than 50% of the network’s hashrate; or botnet-based attacks, in which botnets (volunteers or hacked collections of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers) are used to hijack computing resources and direct them toward mining, effectively amassing enough power to launch an attack.
If a 51% attack were successfully executed, it could lead to a loss of confidence in bitcoin’s security and reliability, causing its price to drop significantly. Such an event could also prompt regulatory restrictions on cryptocurrency mining and trading, further exacerbating the negative impact on our business.
Even if a 51% attack does not occur, the mere perception that such an attack is possible could damage bitcoin’s credibility and discourage institutional adoption. Given our dependence on bitcoin mining, any loss of trust in the 
20

Contents
security of the Bitcoin network could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The scheduled reduction of bitcoin mining rewards due to halving events may decrease our revenue and could force us to cease mining operations.
Bitcoin undergoes a process known as “halving,” which reduces the reward miners receive for successfully mining a block. This process is designed to control the total supply of bitcoin and occurs approximately every four years. The most recent halving in April 2024 reduced mining rewards from 6.25 to 3.125 bitcoin per block, with the next halving expected in April 2028. Halvings are expected to continue until the total bitcoin supply reaches 21,000,000 bitcoin, projected around the year 2140.
Bitcoin prices have fluctuated around past halving events, and there is no guarantee that future halvings will result in price increases sufficient to offset reduced mining rewards. If bitcoin prices do not increase proportionately, our mining revenue may decline, potentially making continued operations financially unsustainable. If we reduce or cease mining, our business would be materially harmed, and investors could suffer a complete loss of their investment.
Further, reduced bitcoin mining incentives due to halving events may weaken network security and adversely affect our operations. Lower mining rewards could lead to a decrease in the hashrate securing the Bitcoin network if miners shut down operations due to reduced profitability. A lower hashrate could slow transaction confirmations and make the network more susceptible to malicious actors gaining control of 50% or more of the total processing power, increasing the risk of fraudulent transactions. Any weakening of Bitcoin network security could negatively impact our operations and harm investor confidence in our securities.
High operating costs and the need for professionalized mining operations may lead to downward pressure on bitcoin prices.
Over the past three years, digital asset mining operations have evolved from individual users mining with computer processors, graphics processing units and first-generation mining rigs. New processing power brought onto the digital asset networks is predominantly added by professionalized mining operations, which may use proprietary hardware or sophisticated machines. Professionalized mining operations require:
•
significant capital investment tin specialized hardware; 
•
leasing operating space (often in data centers or warehousing facilities); 
•
substantial electricity consumption; and 
•
employing technicians to operate the mining sites. 
Unlike past individual miners who may have held mined bitcoin for extended periods, professionalized mining operations typically sell newly mined bitcoin immediately to cover ongoing expenses. If mining profitability declines, professional miners may sell even more bitcoin into the market, increasing supply and potentially driving down bitcoin prices. If this price decline is significant, it could further reduce mining profitability, leading to additional sell-offs and a negative feedback loop that could harm our business and adversely affect an investment in our securities.
Our increasing reliance on immersion-cooling technology exposes us to operational and regulatory risks. 
We are expanding our use of immersion-cooling technology for bitcoin mining, particularly at our Granbury, Texas facility. Immersion-cooling is an emerging, relatively untested technology at scale within the bitcoin mining industry, and we may face challenges in achieving the expected cooling performance. If we fail to optimize our immersion-cooling systems, our mining efficiency and profitability may suffer.
In addition, regulation of certain perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, collectively known as “PFAS,” may affect our operations. Governments in the United States and internationally have increased their focus on and regulation of PFAS which are present in some coolants used in our immersion-cooling systems. Developments in global chemical regulatory trends (including relating to PFAS) could lead to additional compliance costs, potential litigation, or operational disruptions, all of which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.

Loss of access to our private keys or data could result in a permanent loss of our digital assets.
Digital assets are controllable only by the possessor of both the unique public key and private key relating to the local or online digital wallet which hold the digital assets. We are required by the operators of digital asset networks to publish the public key relating to a digital wallet in use once we first verify a spending transaction from that digital wallet and broadcast such information into the respective network. We safeguard the private keys relating to our digital assets by relying on four custody providers, including New York Digital Investment Group LLC (“NYDIG”). To the extent a private key is lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private key is accessible, we would be unable to access the digital assets and the private key would not be capable of being restored by the respective digital asset network. Any loss of private keys relating to digital wallets used to store our digital assets could adversely affect an investment in our securities.
Cybersecurity threats, including hacking and malware, could result in loss of digital assets, reputational damage, and business disruptions.
The digital asset industry is a frequent target for cyberattacks, including:
•
unauthorized access to systems and data;
•
intentional corruption, destruction, or loss of digital assets; and
•
social engineering attacks targeting employees 
A successful cybersecurity breach could result in the theft or loss of our bitcoin holdings, disruptions to our mining operations and significant reputational harm. As our digital asset holdings grow, we may become a more attractive target for cybercriminals, further increasing our risk exposure.
We rely on third-party custody providers’ solutions to safeguard digital assets from theft, loss, destruction or other issues relating to cyberattacks. Notwithstanding the safeguards implemented to protect our assets, the third-party security systems may not be impenetrable or free from defect, and any loss due to a security breach, software defect or event outside of our control will be borne by us.
Our systems and operational infrastructure may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, error or malfeasance of an employee or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our private keys, data or digital assets. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce our employees to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our systems or infrastructure. 
Despite our efforts, we may be unable to anticipate security breaches, including cyberattacks, or implement adequate preventative measures since the hacking techniques used often are not recognized until launched against a target. If an actual or perceived breach of our security systems occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our controls could be harmed, which could adversely affect an investment in our securities.
Further, in the event of a security breach, we may suffer damage to our key systems and experience interruption in our services, loss of ability to control or operate our equipment or loss of critical data that could interrupt our operations. Such potential consequences of a security breach may adversely impact our reputation and brand and expose us to increased risks of governmental and regulatory investigation and enforcement actions, private litigation and other liability, any of which could adversely affect our business.
The irreversibility of digital asset transactions exposes us to risks of theft, loss and human error, which could negatively impact our business.
Digital asset transactions are not, from an administrative perspective, reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the transaction or, in theory, control or consent of a majority of the processing power on that digital asset network. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain, an incorrect transfer of digital assets or a theft of digital assets generally will not be reversible, and we may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer or theft. 
22
Table of

Although we regularly transfer digital assets to or from vendors, consultants and services providers, it is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, such assets could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties. 
To the extent we are unable to seek a corrective transaction to identify the third party which has received our digital assets through error or theft, we will be unable to revert or otherwise recover the impacted digital assets, and any such loss could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our reliance on third-party hosting providers for bitcoin mining operations exposes us to financial and operational risks.

We rely on third-party hosting providers to power a portion of our mining rigs. If these providers experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, or fail to meet their contractual obligations, our ability to mine bitcoin could be significantly impacted.
In 2022, our largest hosting provider, Compute North, filed for bankruptcy, resulting in a $55.7 million impairment charge for our company. Hosting contracts often include provisions that allow hosting providers to place liens on our mining equipment, which could delay or prevent us from reclaiming our assets in the event of a provider’s bankruptcy. Additionally, significant deposits made to hosting providers may be at risk if those funds are used for the provider’s operations or are otherwise inaccessible due to bankruptcy proceedings. These factors introduce uncertainty and financial risk that could materially impact our business.
Intellectual property disputes related to digital asset technology could threaten our ability to operate.

The legal landscape for digital assets remains uncertain, and third parties may assert intellectual property claims related to blockchain technology, digital asset transactions or source code. Any litigation, regardless of its merit, could create uncertainty about the long-term viability of digital asset networks and reduce investor confidence in our business. If a court upholds an intellectual property claim, we and other market participants could be restricted from accessing certain digital asset networks or conducting transactions, which could materially impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Variability in intellectual property laws may adversely affect our intellectual property position.

Intellectual property laws, and patent laws and regulations in particular, have been subject to significant variability either through administrative or legislative changes to such laws or regulations or changes or differences in judicial interpretation, and we expect that such variability will continue to occur. Additionally, intellectual property laws and regulations differ among states and countries. Variations in patent laws and regulations (or in interpretations of patent laws and regulations) in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our intellectual property and may change the impact of third-party intellectual property on our business. Accordingly, we cannot predict the scope of patents that may be granted to us, the extent to which we will be able to enforce our patents against third parties or the extent to which third parties may be able to enforce their patents against us.

Developing and protecting new inventions and intellectual property is costly, time-consuming and uncertain.

Our pursuit to develop new inventions or intellectual property requires significant financial, managerial and other resources. There is no guarantee that these efforts will result in valuable intellectual property or generate revenue. Even if we develop new technologies, securing and maintaining a proprietary position presents additional risks, including:
•
delays or failures in obtaining patents;
•
patent challenges, including interference and opposition proceedings;
•
competitors developing similar or alternative technologies; and
•
complexity, cost, and uncertainty of patent enforcement.
Even issued patents may not provide meaningful protection, as they can be circumvented, challenged, invalidated or narrowed in scope. Additionally, if others have already patented similar technologies, we may need to obtain costly licenses or be restricted from commercializing certain products. Patent application delays could also impact our ability to generate revenue from internally developed patents and may cause us to miss market opportunities.

Our future success depends on our ability to expand our organization to match the growth of our activities
.

As our operations grow, the administrative demands and scaling demands upon us will grow, and our success will depend upon our ability to meet those demands. MARA and our subsidiaries require certain financial, managerial and other resources, which could create challenges to our ability to successfully manage our subsidiaries and operations and impact our ability to assure compliance with our policies, practices and procedures. These demands include, but are not limited to, increased executive, technical, operations, accounting, legal, staff support and general office services. We may need to hire additional qualified personnel, including contractors, to meet these demands, the cost and quality of which is dependent in part upon market factors outside of our control. Further, we will need to effectively manage the training and growth of our staff to maintain an efficient and effective workforce, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business and operating results.

We are highly dependent on the continued service of our executive team. 

We depend upon the efforts, experience, diligence, skill and network of business contacts of our senior management team, and our success will depend on their continued service. The departure of any of our executive officers or key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Prolonged power and internet outages, shortages or capacity constraints could harm our business.
Our mining operations rely on a significant amount of electricity and high-speed internet access. The success of any current or future mining site depends on securing sufficient, cost-effective power. We operate across a mix of fully owned campuses, leased properties, and active hosting agreements, each with unique power arrangements. If we are unable to obtain adequate electricity or experience prolonged internet outages, we may be forced to scale back or shut down operations.
Geopolitical events, including the war in Ukraine and high inflation, have driven up global energy prices. If power costs continue to rise, our ability to mine bitcoin profitably could be severely impacted. At times of high energy prices or shortages, we may voluntarily reduce power consumption or be required to do so under agreements with utility providers. In some cases, utilities or government entities may restrict or prohibit electricity use for mining operations, further limiting our ability to generate bitcoin.
As we expand to new sites, competition for locations with affordable power could intensify. Any limitations on power access could materially and adversely affect our business, financial performance and future growth.
Noise generated by our mining operations poses regulatory, legal, operational and reputational risks.
Our mining operations involve the use of a large number of high-powered miners and cooling systems that generate substantial noise. This noise poses risks to our business, including community complaints, reputational damage, litigation risk, regulatory risk, operational constraints, increased costs and opposition to expansion. These risks could lead to fines or penalties imposed by local governments, requirements to implement costly noise mitigation measures, restrictions on our operating hours, reduction of scale of our operations, stricter noise controls regulations on our operations, potential shutdown of data centers that cannot meet local noise regulations, damages resulting from lawsuits and difficulty obtaining necessary permits and approvals for expanding existing data centers or establishing new site operations. These risks may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Enforcement
The rapidly evolving and uncertain regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies exposes us to legal risks, compliance costs, and potential business disruptions.
Our business operates within a complex and evolving regulatory framework that includes a wide range of federal, state, and international laws, rules, and policies. These include regulations governing financial services, securities, commodities, money transmission, consumer lending, privacy, cybersecurity, taxation, anti-bribery, sanctions, anti-money laundering, and other areas. Many of these laws were enacted before the rise of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology, creating uncertainty in their interpretation and application.
24
Table of 
Contents
Regulatory bodies, including the SEC, CFTC, federal energy regulators, and other financial oversight agencies, frequently modify and reinterpret existing rules, leading to inconsistencies across jurisdictions. As a result, we must exercise judgment in determining how certain laws apply to our operations, and regulators may not always agree with our interpretations. If we are found to be in violation of any applicable laws, we could face significant fines, license revocations, product or service restrictions, reputational damage, and other regulatory consequences that could materially impact our business.
Additionally, failures of major cryptocurrency trading platforms and lenders, such as FTX, Celsius, Voyager, and Three Arrows Capital, have intensified calls for stricter oversight of the crypto economy. In response, legislative and regulatory bodies in the U.S. and abroad are actively considering new regulations that could affect our operations. Increased scrutiny and regulatory actions may subject us to audits, examinations, investigations, and enforcement proceedings that could disrupt our business and increase compliance costs
Given the unpredictable nature of cryptocurrency regulation and enforcement, any adverse regulatory developments, whether through new laws, changing interpretations, or enforcement actions, could negatively impact our reputation, business operations, financial condition, and ability to offer competitive products and services.
The unregulated nature and lack of transparency of many bitcoin trading venues may expose us to fraud, security failures, and operational risks, potentially harming the value of our bitcoin holdings.

Bitcoin trading venues are relatively new and, in some cases, operate with minimal regulation. Many exchanges do not provide the public with significant information about their ownership, management, corporate practices, or regulatory compliance. As a result, confidence in bitcoin trading venues could decline, especially if prominent exchanges suffer fraud, business failures, cyberattacks, or government-imposed restrictions.
A lack of stability in the broader bitcoin market or the closure of key trading venues could lead to increased price volatility. If investors view our common stock as linked to our bitcoin holdings, these market disruptions could negatively impact the market value of our stock.

If bitcoin is classified as a security, we may be subject to extensive regulation, which could result in significant costs or force us to cease certain operations.

Regulatory changes or interpretations that classify bitcoin as a security under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), could require us to register and comply with additional regulations. Compliance with these requirements could impose extraordinary, non-recurring expenses on our business. If the costs and regulatory burdens become too great, we may be forced to modify or cease certain operations, which could be detrimental to our investors.
The SEC has previously indicated that certain digital assets may be considered securities depending on their structure and use. While no formal regulations have been proposed to classify bitcoin as a security, future developments could change its legal status, requiring us to comply with securities laws. If we fail to do so, we may be forced to discontinue some or all of our business activities, negatively impacting investments in our securities.
If the SEC or other regulators determine that bitcoin or other digital assets we hold qualify as securities, we may be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. This classification would subject us to additional periodic reporting, disclosure requirements, and regulatory compliance obligations, significantly increasing our operational costs.
Although we do not currently engage in investing, reinvesting, or trading securities, and we do not hold ourselves out as an investment company, we could inadvertently be deemed one under the Investment Company Act. If we are unable to rely on an exclusion, we would be required to register with the SEC, which could impose additional financial and regulatory burdens.
Furthermore, state regulators may conclude that the digital assets we hold are securities under state laws, requiring us to comply with state-specific securities regulations. States like California have stricter definitions of “investment contracts” than the SEC, increasing the risk of additional regulatory scrutiny.
25
Table of 
Contents
Any additional registration requirements, whether due to regulatory developments or an inadvertent classification as an investment company, could result in extraordinary compliance costs and adversely impact an investment in our securities. If we determine that compliance is too costly, we may seek to cease certain or all operations, which could lead to significant investment losses for our shareholders.

Our bitcoin holdings could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and potential restrictions on future transactions.

Regulators are increasingly focused on the use of digital assets in illicit activities, such as money laundering and sanctions violations. We maintain policies designed to comply with anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and acquire bitcoin only from regulated entities. However, if we are found to have unknowingly purchased bitcoin from bad actors or sanctioned individuals, we could face regulatory proceedings, and our ability to engage in future bitcoin transactions may be restricted or prohibited.
Operating in foreign jurisdictions exposes us to political, legal, and regulatory risks that could negatively impact our financial condition.

Expanding our business internationally subjects us to the political, legal, and fiscal instability of different countries. Governments may enact policies that disrupt our operations, such as forced divestment, expropriation of assets, contract cancellations, additional taxes, or regulatory changes that increase our compliance burden. These actions could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow, and financial stability.
Additionally, political and social factors may lead to unpredictable judicial rulings that adversely affect our business. Some governments have unilaterally amended or canceled existing agreements, failed to honor contractual commitments, or intervened in disputes between private parties. In some cases, conflicting legal obligations in different jurisdictions could expose us to potential civil or criminal sanctions.
These risks, whether occurring individually or in combination, could negatively impact our financial performance and increase our exposure to regulatory investigations, litigation, and financial penalties.
Target energy regulations and taxes could increase our costs and adversely affect our business.
Bitcoin mining requires significant energy consumption, and our operations could be negatively impacted by government regulations or taxes specifically targeting energy usage in digital asset mining. Federal, state or local authorities may impose restrictions on energy consumption, mandate the use of renewable energy sources or implement higher electricity rates for mining operations, increasing our operating costs. Additionally, governments may introduce taxes on energy usage or carbon emissions that disproportionately affect bitcoin miners, further reducing our profitability. If regulatory or tax burdens make mining economically unviable in certain jurisdictions, we may be forced to relocate operations, secure alternative power sources at higher costs or scale back our mining activities, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Changes in regulatory interpretations could require us to register as a money services business or money transmitter, leading to increased compliance costs or operational shutdowns.

If regulatory changes or interpretations require us to register as a money services business with FinCEN under the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, or as a money transmitter under state laws, we may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements, resulting in significant compliance costs and operational burdens. In such a case, we may incur extraordinary expenses to meet these requirements or, alternatively, may determine that continued operations are not viable. If we decide to cease certain operations in response to new regulatory obligations, such actions could occur at a time that is unfavorable to investors.
Multiple states have implemented or proposed regulatory frameworks for digital asset businesses. Compliance with such state-specific regulations may increase costs or impact our business operations. Furthermore, if we or our service providers are unable to comply with evolving federal or state regulations, we may be forced to dissolve or liquidate certain operations, which could materially impact our investors.

The classification of bitcoin as a commodity could subject us to additional CFTC regulation, resulting in significant compliance costs or the cessation of certain operations.

Under current interpretations, bitcoin is classified as a commodity under the Commodity Exchange Act and is subject to regulation by the CFTC. If our activities require CFTC registration, we may be required to comply with extensive regulatory obligations, which could result in significant costs and operational disruptions. Additionally, current and future legislative or regulatory developments, including new CFTC interpretations, could further impact how bitcoin and bitcoin derivatives are classified and traded.
If bitcoin is further regulated as a commodity, we may be required to register as a commodity pool operator and register the Company as a commodity pool with the CFTC through the National Futures Association. Compliance with these additional regulatory requirements could result in substantial, non-recurring expenses, adversely affecting an investment in our securities. If we determine not to comply with such regulations, we may be forced to cease certain operations, which could negatively impact our investors.

Changes in tax laws or IRS guidance regarding bitcoin’s classification could negatively impact our business and stockholders.

If federal or state tax authorities change bitcoin’s classification from property to another category, such as currency or financial asset, the resulting tax implications could negatively affect us and our stockholders. Currently, the IRS treats bitcoin as property, which allows for capital gains treatment but also imposes certain tax reporting requirements, particularly for transactions classified as barter exchanges. Any changes in tax treatment could materially impact the financial and operational aspects of our business and adversely affect an investment in our securities.
Our interactions with the Bitcoin network may expose us to transactions with sanctioned individuals, leading to regulatory penalties and reputational harm.
The Office of Financial Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the U.S. Department of Treasury requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct business with persons named on its SDN list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions we may inadvertently and without our knowledge engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC’s SDN list. Our policy prohibits any transactions with such SDN individuals, and we take all commercially reasonable steps to avoid such transactions, but we may not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the individual with whom we transact with respect to selling cryptocurrency assets. Moreover, there is a risk that some bad actors will continue to attempt to use cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, as a potential means of avoiding federally imposed sanctions, such as those imposed in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 
We are unable to predict the nature or extent of new and proposed legislation and regulation affecting the cryptocurrency industry, or the potential impact of the use of cryptocurrencies by SDN or other blocked or sanctioned persons, which could have material adverse effects on our business and our industry more broadly. Further, we may be subject to investigation, administrative or court proceedings, and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties as a result of any regulatory enforcement actions, all of which could harm our reputation and affect the value of our common stock.
Changing environmental regulations and public energy policies could increase our costs and threaten our bitcoin mining operations.
Bitcoin mining requires substantial energy consumption, and our ability to operate profitably depends on securing electricity at competitive rates. Our strategic expansion plans rely on assumptions about current energy regulations and policies. If new environmental or energy regulations are enacted, or if existing ones change, we may face increased costs or operational limitations that could impact our business model.
The lack of consistent climate legislation creates uncertainty for our industry, and bitcoin mining’s high energy usage makes it a potential target for future regulations. New laws could impose higher energy costs, require additional capital investments, mandate environmental monitoring, or impose other compliance burdens. Additionally, bitcoin miners in Texas have recently been required to disclose extensive information about their 
27
Table of 
Contents
energy usage to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which could lead to negative public perception and further regulatory scrutiny.
The ongoing debate over climate change policies adds further uncertainty to our financial outlook. Even without regulatory changes, negative publicity regarding bitcoin mining’s environmental impact could damage our reputation and affect our financial condition.
Increased scrutiny and changing expectations from stockholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) practices and the impacts of climate change may result in additional costs or risks.
Companies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their ESG practices. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the non-financial impacts of their investments. Conversely, so-called “anti-ESG” and “anti-DEI” sentiment has also gained momentum across the United States, with several state and federal authorities having enacted or proposed “anti-ESG” policies or legislation, issued executive orders and legal opinions and engaged in related investigations and litigation. If our policies or practices are viewed as being in contradiction of such “anti-ESG” or “anti-DEI” policies, legislation executive orders or legal opinions, our reputation may be harmed and our business or financial condition may be adversely affected.
The SEC adopted a rule that requires climate disclosures in periodic and other filings with the SEC covering fiscal years beginning in 2025, which rule has been stayed pending the completion of a judicial review. To comply with this SEC rule, if the rule goes into effect in its current form, we will be required to establish additional internal controls, engage additional consultants and incur additional costs related to evaluating, managing and reporting on our environmental impact and climate-related risks and opportunities. If we fail to implement sufficient oversight or accurately capture and disclose on environmental matters, our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, increased public awareness and concern regarding environmental risks, including global climate change, may result in increased public scrutiny of our business and our industry, and our management team may divert significant time and energy away from our operations and towards responding to such scrutiny.
In addition, the physical risks of climate change may impact the availability and cost of materials and natural resources, sources and supplies of energy, and demand for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and could increase our insurance and other operating costs, including, potentially, to repair damage incurred as a result of extreme weather events or to renovate or retrofit facilities to better withstand extreme weather events. If environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements on our operations, or if our operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change, our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted.
Risks Relating to Our Common Stock

Our stock price is volatile and subject to significant fluctuations.

The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and may fluctuate widely due to factors beyond our control, including:
•
changes in our industry, particularly those affecting bitcoin and other digital assets;
•
variability in bitcoin pricing;
•
competitive pricing pressures;
•
our ability to obtain working capital financing;
•
additions or departures of key personnel;
•
sales of our common stock;
•
our ability to execute our business plan effectively;
•
operating results that fall below expectations;
•
loss of strategic relationships;
•
regulatory developments; and
28
Table of 
Contents
•
broader economic and external factors.
Additionally, securities markets have historically experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations unrelated to specific companies' performance. Such market fluctuations could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.
Our ongoing at-the-market stock issuances contribute to stockholder dilution and may intensify due to our HODL strategy.
Our at-the-market (“ATM”) offerings have contributed to dilution, and if we continue selling shares through future ATM offerings, stockholders will experience further dilution. Additionally, our strategy of holding bitcoin on our balance sheet may necessitate increased stock issuances through ATM offerings to fund operations, exacerbating dilution concerns. Investors should be aware that continued stock issuances may negatively impact the value of their holdings.
The issuance, conversion, or exercise of convertible notes and other convertible securities, options, and warrants will dilute our stockholders' ownership.

We have issued, and may continue to issue, convertible securities, options, and warrants to officers, directors, consultants, and certain stockholders. Additionally, we have issued convertible notes to certain institutional investors in private offerings. The exercise, conversion, or exchange of these instruments, including for other securities, will dilute existing stockholders’ ownership percentages. This dilution may negatively impact our ability to obtain additional capital. Holders of these securities may choose to exercise or convert them at times when we could otherwise secure equity capital on more favorable terms or when our common stock is trading above the exercise or conversion price.

Uncertainty in accounting standards for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may lead to financial restatements and business disruptions.
Limited precedent exists for the financial accounting of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets. Future changes in regulatory or accounting standards could require us to alter our accounting practices and restate financial statements, potentially affecting how we account for newly mined cryptocurrency rewards. Such changes could materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and operating results. A restatement may also raise concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern, negatively affecting investor confidence and the value of cryptocurrencies we hold or acquire.

The sale or availability of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may negatively impact our stock price.

If a significant number of our stockholders sell shares in the public market following the expiration of statutory holding periods or lock-up agreements, under Rule 144, or after the exercise of outstanding warrants or convertible securities, it could create an “overhang” effect. This anticipated sell-off could depress our stock price, regardless of actual sales activity. The presence of an overhang may also hinder our ability to raise additional capital through equity or equity-related securities on favorable terms.

ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY
Information Security Program
The mission of our information security organization is to design, implement, and maintain an information security program that protects our systems, services, and data against unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, damage, and loss. The information security organization is comprised of internal and external security and technology professionals. We continue to make investments in information security resources to mature, expand, and adapt our 
29
Table of 
Contents
capabilities to address emerging cybersecurity risks and threats. The information security organization is overseen by the Information Security Advisory Team (the “ISAT”), further detailed under the caption “Cybersecurity Governance” below.
Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy
Cybersecurity risk management is one component of our information security program that guides continuous improvement to, and evaluates the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our critical systems, data, and operations.
Our approach to controls and risk management is based on guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) and the CryptoCurrency Security Standard (“CCSS”). This does not mean that we meet any particular technical standards, specifications, or requirements, but rather that we use the NIST and CCSS as a guide to help us identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity controls and risks relevant to our business.
Our cybersecurity risk management program includes:
•
Identifying cybersecurity risks that could impact our facilities, 
third-party vendors/partners,
 operations, critical systems, information, and broader enterprise information technology (“IT”) environment. Risks are informed by threat intelligence, current and historical adversarial activity, and industry specify threats
;
•
Performing a cybersecurity risk assessment to evaluate our readiness if the risks were to materialize; and
•
Ensuring risk is addressed and tracking any necessary remediation through an action plan.
In addition, we periodically engage third-party consultants and providers to assist us in assessing, testing, enhancing and monitoring our cybersecurity risk management programs and responding to any incidents. These third parties work in conjunction with the ISAT in an effort to continuously improve our cybersecurity risk posture. Examples of third-party actions include risk assessments and penetration testing of our systems.
While we face a number of ongoing cybersecurity risks in connection with our business, such risks have not materially affected us to date, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.
Cybersecurity Governance
Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated the oversight of cybersecurity and other IT risks to the Board’s Risk and Audit Committee. 
As part of this oversight, we created the 
ISAT
.

The ISAT is comprised of cybersecurity consultants and senior managers and executives from multiple functions within MARA, including IT, finance, legal, internal audit and operations. Members of the ISAT have extensive professional experience in cybersecurity, software engineering and information technology and hold industry-recognized certifications, including Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP). The ISAT oversees our information security program and our strategy, including management’s implementation of cybersecurity risk management. The ISAT meets at least semi-annually to discuss matters involving cybersecurity risks.

The ISAT ultimately provides information to our Risk and Audit Committee regarding its activities, including those related to cybersecurity risks. 
The Risk and Audit Committee also receives a briefing and continuing education from a member of the ISAT relating to our cybersecurity risk management program at least annually.
 The ISAT is responsible for notifying the Risk and Audit Committee of material cybersecurity incidents.
