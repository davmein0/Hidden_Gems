Forward-Looking Statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbor for "forward-looking statements" provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements may include statements that expressly or implicitly predict future results, performance, or events. Statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. You can find many of these statements by looking for words such as "anticipates," "expects," "believes," "estimates," "intends," "forecast", and words or phrases of similar meaning. 
We make forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, statements about derivatives and hedging; the results and performance of models and economic forecasts used in our calculation of the ACL; projected sources of funds and the Company's liquidity position and deposit level and types; our securities portfolio; loan sales; adequacy of our ACL, including the RUC; provision for credit losses; non-performing loans and future losses; our commercial real estate portfolio, its collectability and subsequent charge-offs; resolution of non-accrual loans; mortgage volumes and the impact of rate changes; the economic environment; inflation and interest rates generally; litigation; dividends; junior subordinated debentures; fair values of certain assets and liabilities, including MSR values and sensitivity analyses; tax rates; deposit pricing; and the effect of accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting methodology.

Introduction
Columbia Banking System, Inc. (referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as "we," "our," the "Company," and "Columbia") is a registered financial holding company. Columbia completed its previously announced merger with UHC on February 28, 2023, combining two premier banks in the Northwest to create one of the largest banks headquartered in the West.
Through the Bank, we provide a broad range of banking, private banking, mortgage, and other financial services to corporate, institutional, small business, and individual customers. FinPac, a commercial equipment leasing company, is a subsidiary of the Bank. Along with its subsidiaries, the Company is subject to the regulations of state and federal agencies and undergoes regular examinations by these regulatory agencies. 
The majority of the Bank’s loans and deposits are within its service areas in Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah. Umpqua Bank is an Oregon state-chartered commercial bank, the deposits of which are insured in whole or in part by the FDIC.
Business Strategy
Columbia, through its principal subsidiary, Umpqua Bank, seeks to bank businesses of all sizes, along with their owners, executives, and employees, in addition to the residents of the communities we serve. We seek to provide our customers with the financial sophistication and product depth of a regional banking company while retaining the appeal and service level of a community bank. Our approach is a concentrated focus on full banking relationships, bringing together collaborative teams from commercial and consumer banking as well as wealth management, and leveraging our retail branch network to provide community banking at scale through our "Business Bank of Choice" across the West strategy.
We continually evaluate our existing business processes while focusing on maintaining asset quality and granular loan and deposit portfolios diversified by product, customer, industry, and geography. Our merger with UHC accelerated our targeted strategy to expand market share in communities in the western United States. Our scaled franchise and offerings, talented associate base, and customer-focused business model enable us to provide comprehensive financial services in a manner that serves our four identified stakeholder groups: associates, customers, shareholders, and communities. We seek to expand total revenue while controlling expenses in an effort to gain operational efficiencies and increase our return on average tangible common equity. As a result of our strong commitment to highly personalized, relationship-oriented customer service, our diverse products, our strategic branch locations, and the long-standing community presence of our associates, we believe we are well positioned to attract new customers while not only retaining existing customers, but also deepening our relationship with them. Our ability to attract and retain talented associates strengthens our ability to drive balanced growth in loans, deposits, and sustainable core fee income that results from providing customers tailored financial solutions to meet their needs.
Products and Services
We place the highest priority on customer service and assist our customers in making informed decisions when selecting from the products and services we offer. Our array of financial products are delivered through traditional and digital channels to meet the banking needs of our market area and commercial and consumer customers. To ensure the ongoing viability of our product offerings, we regularly examine the desirability and profitability of existing and potential new products. Our customers can access our products through our branch network, mobile banking applications, and our website: www.umpquabank.com (information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K).
Commercial Lending Products.
 We offer specialized loans for corporate, middle market, and small business customers, including commercial lines of credit and term loans, accounts receivable and inventory financing, international trade finance, commercial property loans, multifamily loans, equipment loans, commercial equipment leases, real estate construction loans and permanent financing, SBA program financing, and capital markets.

Treasury Management and Payments.

As

Umpqua Bank focuses on banking the full customer relationship and meeting the needs of customers of all sizes, we offer treasury management and payments solutions to our customers through our Global Payments & Deposits group. These products include business digital and mobile banking solutions, ACH, wires, positive pay, remote deposit capture, integrated payments, integrated receivables, lockbox, cash vault, Real-Time Payments via The Clearinghouse, commercial card, and foreign exchange and international banking related products. We also offer merchant services in coordination with a strategic partner. Within our business digital experience, customers can engage in a fully authenticated chat and co-browse feature with a knowledgeable representative if they require assistance with any of the Bank’s solutions. We offer our treasury management and payments solutions using a unique consulting experience for prospects and customers that involves a holistic review of a business's cash flows and financial operations to advise the business on opportunities to optimize working capital, gain efficiencies through automation, and achieve cost savings through financial technology deployment.
Deposit Products.
 We offer deposit products, including non-interest-bearing checking accounts, analyzed business accounts, interest-bearing checking and savings accounts, money market accounts, insured cash sweep and other investment sweep solutions, and certificates of deposit. Interest-bearing accounts earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and management's desire to increase certain types of deposit liabilities. Our approach is to provide a streamlined and differentiated experience that meets the customer's needs across all channels. This approach is designed to add value for the customer and generate related fee income for the services provided. 
Wealth Management.
 As a division of Umpqua Bank, the Wealth Management team provides a full suite of financial planning, investment, trust, insurance, and private banking solutions to individuals, families, and businesses through Columbia Wealth Advisors, Columbia Trust Company, and Columbia Private Bank. We deliver personalized service and experience through dedicated financial advisors that leverage an approach revolving around the three stages of the wealth cycle: grow, preserve, and transition.
Residential Real Estate Loans.
 Real estate loans are available for the construction, purchase, and refinancing of residential owner occupied and rental properties. Borrowers can choose from a variety of fixed and adjustable rate options and terms. We sell many of the residential real estate loans that we originate into the secondary market. Servicing is retained on the majority of these loans.
Consumer Loans.
 We provide loans to individual borrowers for a variety of purposes, including secured and unsecured personal loans, home equity and personal lines of credit, and motor vehicle loans.
Market Area and Competition
The geographic markets we serve are highly competitive for deposits, loans, and leases. We compete with traditional banking institutions, as well as non-bank financial service providers, such as credit unions, mortgage companies, fintechs, and online based financial service providers. In our market areas of Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah, major national banks generally hold top market share positions. Competition also includes small community banks that operate in concentrated areas within our footprint and other regional banks that focus on commercial and retail banking. 
As the industry becomes increasingly oriented toward technology-driven delivery systems, permitting transactions to be conducted on mobile devices and computers, non-bank institutions are able to attract customers and provide lending and other financial services even without offices located in our primary service area. Some insurance companies and brokerage firms compete for deposits by offering rates that are higher than the weighted average market price and may be inappropriate for the Bank in relation to its asset and liability management objectives. 
Credit unions present a significant competitive challenge for our banking services and products. As credit unions currently enjoy an exemption from income tax, they are able to offer higher deposit rates and lower loan rates than banks can on a comparable basis. Credit unions are also not currently subject to certain regulatory constraints, such as the Community Reinvestment Act, which, among other things, requires us to implement procedures to make and monitor loans throughout the communities we serve. Adhering to such regulatory requirements raises the costs associated with our lending activities and reduces potential operating profits.

We seek to compete by focusing on building customer relationships, providing superior service, and offering a wide variety of commercial and consumer banking products. Our branch system funds our lending activities and allows us to better serve both retail (consumer) and business (commercial) depositors. We believe this approach enables us to expand lending activities while attracting a stable core deposit base and enhancing utilization of our full range of products and services. Our branch system and other delivery channels are continually evaluated as an important component of ongoing efforts to improve efficiencies without compromising customer service.
The following table presents the Bank's market share percentage for total deposits as of June 30, 2024 in each state where we have operations. The table also indicates the ranking by deposit size in each market. All information in the table was obtained from S&P Global, which compiles deposit data published by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as of June 30, 2024 and updates the information for any bank mergers and acquisitions completed subsequent to the reporting date.

Sustainability and Responsible Business 
We take pride in being an active partner to build stronger, more resilient, better connected, and thriving economies throughout our footprint. Our approach to sustainability is about making responsible business decisions that support all of our stakeholders for the long term, and it is embedded in the fabric of our corporate values and culture, driving us to think very intentionally about how we serve our communities. 
To inform our strategy and approach, the Company completed a comprehensive assessment of our corporate impact in early 2024 to identify priority sustainability areas for the Company, building on research completed in 2023. Through internal and external stakeholder analysis, fourteen key topics were identified and ranked with the final prioritization approved by executive leadership and the Board’s Nominating and Governance Committee. Additionally, the Company expanded its corporate responsibility performance reporting in our most recent annual Corporate Responsibility Report to reference recommendations by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure, alongside standards outlined by the Global Reporting Initiative and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board frameworks.
Our annual Corporate Responsibility Report is available at the “About Us-Our Impact” section of the Bank's website (www.umpquabank.com) but is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This report provides additional detail about our commitment to operating responsibly and building long-term value for all of our stakeholders. A brief overview: 
Associates
We create an environment where our associates have the chance to grow, connect, and do meaningful work together.                                                     
Relationship banking is at our core, and our people are the key to maintaining relationships with each other, our customers, and our communities. Our Do Right TOGETHER culture lays the foundation for fostering an environment where associates care about one another, root for the customer down the street, and participate in making their community a better place to live and work. Our associates are encouraged to use their skills and passions to make a difference in their communities while growing their careers and being recognized and appreciated for their respective talents, backgrounds, and perspectives.

Workforce Composition
.
 As of December 31, 2024, we employed 4,721 employees, the majority of which were full-time associates. Our workforce includes customer-facing associates across our various business lines. These include our retail branches, business and commercial banking teams, wealth management and trust experts, as well as professionals in various support functions that enable the business, such as technology, finance, risk, audit, legal, and human resources. Our teams are primarily in eight western states.

Total workforce decreased by 8%, which was driven primarily by staff reductions that took place in 2024 related to the enterprise-wide evaluation of our operations, which resulted in consolidated positions and simplified reporting and organizational structures; natural attrition; and shifts in the business strategy in specific lines of business. Turnover rate, as calculated in our payroll system on a combined basis, was 25%.

We offer competitive medical, dental, vision, life, short and long-term disability, and accident insurance, in addition to paid time off for vacation, sick time, and volunteerism. Medical benefits are available to associates working 30 hours per week, while paid time off begins at 20 hours per week. These programs are assessed regularly against market benchmarks. 
Compensation.
 We attract and reward our associates by providing market competitive compensation and benefit practices. Our compensation approach is designed to pay for performance and reward associate contributions. Our salary structure is informed by market data, and recognizing that the compensation environment is dynamic, we review and adjust our pay ranges regularly. This includes an ongoing practice of analyzing pay equity. In addition, many positions have incentive plans to encourage achievement of various corporate, business unit, and individual goals.
On a regular basis, we conduct an associate engagement survey to gain insights into associate sentiment about various aspects of the associate experience. This feedback is used to assess the effectiveness of our people practices and prioritize enhancements to our programs. 
Talent Development.
 We believe in the growth of our associates as individuals and as professionals. Our talent development programs provide our associates with the skills and experiences that allow them to thrive, supporting achievement of their personal career goals. We provide on-demand learning for all associates, in addition to specific training for many roles. Our development programs build key leadership capabilities, and support growth of our internal leadership talent pipeline. We have available new manager programs, tuition reimbursement, banking school participation, coaching, and mentoring programs. Additionally, we have a robust annual talent review and succession planning program that is key to our overall talent management practice. This results in targeted development approaches, identification of emerging talent, and a healthy succession-talent bench.
Inclusion and Belonging
. 
The Company’s culture starts with providing a great place to work where appreciation for different experiences, cultures and perspectives builds a sense of belonging that attracts an associate base that reflects the composition of our communities. We are committed to creating banking experiences and solutions that support and attract our communities. We accomplish this by recruiting the best qualified associates and building teams that reflect our communities. It is our policy to comply with all laws applicable to discrimination in the workplace. We believe we are stronger when we have people at the table who represent the different life experiences and perspectives of our customers and community. 
Our culture of belonging is created through a comprehensive support system guided by the Company’s executive team and supported by our Belonging Council, which is comprised of leaders from across the organization. We strive to be a bank that serves our full community and take pride in our role as a community leader. 
Information about our Executive Officers
Information regarding employment agreements with our executive officers is contained in Item 11 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which item is incorporated by reference to the Proxy Statement.
Government Policies
The operations of the Company and our subsidiaries are affected by state and federal legislative and regulatory changes and by policies of various regulatory authorities, including domestic monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, United States fiscal policy, and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies. 
Supervision and Regulation
The following discussion provides an overview of certain elements of the extensive regulatory framework applicable to the Company and Umpqua Bank, which operates in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington. This regulatory framework is primarily designed for the protection of depositors, customers, federal DIFs and the banking system as a whole, rather than specifically for the protection of shareholders or non-depository creditors. Due to the breadth and growth of this regulatory framework, our costs of compliance continue to increase in order to monitor and satisfy these requirements.

To the extent that this section describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified by reference to those provisions. These statutes and regulations, as well as related policies, are subject to change by Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulators. Changes in statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to us, including the interpretation or implementation thereof, cannot be predicted, but may have a material effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Our continued efforts to monitor and comply with new regulatory requirements and developments add to the complexity and cost of our business.
We expect that the change in presidential administration will result in a regulatory agenda that differs from that of the previous presidential administration, which could lead to significant impacts on the rulemaking, supervision, examination, and enforcement priorities of federal agencies, including the federal banking agencies. We will continue to monitor regulatory developments and assess their impacts on the Company.
Federal and State Bank Holding Company Regulation
General
. The Company is a bank holding company as defined in the BHCA that has elected to become a financial holding company, and is therefore subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve. The Company must file reports with and provide the Federal Reserve such additional information as it may require. Under the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, a bank holding company may apply to the Federal Reserve to become a financial holding company, and thereby engage (directly or through a subsidiary) in certain expanded activities deemed financial in nature, such as securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and brokerage, merchant banking and other activities that are determined by the FRB, in coordination with the Treasury Department, to be “financial in nature or incidental thereto” or that the FRB determines unilaterally to be “complementary” to financial activities. Upon the consummation of our merger with UHC in early 2023, the Company elected to be treated as a financial holding company. To maintain its status as a financial holding company, a bank holding company (and all of its depository institution subsidiaries) must each remain “well capitalized” and “well managed.” If a bank holding company fails to meet these regulatory standards, the Federal Reserve could place limitations on its ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies or impose limitations or conditions on the conduct or activities of the bank holding company or its affiliates. If the deficiencies persisted, the Federal Reserve could order the bank holding company to divest any subsidiary bank or to cease engaging in any activities permissible for financial holding companies that are not permissible for bank holding companies.
Holding Company Bank Ownership
.

The BHCA requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5% of such shares; (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company; or (iii) merging or consolidating with another bank holding company. In addition, under the BMA, the prior approval of the FDIC is required for the Bank to merge with another bank or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or assume any of the deposits of another FDIC IDI. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, bank regulators consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position and managerial resources of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant’s performance record under the CRA, the applicant’s compliance with other laws, including fair housing and consumer protection laws, and the effectiveness of all organizations involved in combating money laundering activities. In addition, failure to implement or maintain adequate compliance programs could cause bank regulators not to approve an acquisition where regulatory approval is required or to prohibit an acquisition even if approval is not required.

These provisions “encourage” the Department of Justice and the federal banking regulators to update guidelines on banking mergers and to provide more scrutiny of bank mergers. In September 2024, the FDIC approved a final statement of policy on bank merger transactions that details the types of transactions that require FDIC approval, the principles the FDIC applies when applying the BMA statutory factors, and the procedures the FDIC uses in reviewing BMA applications. The statement of policy provides, among other things, that (i) the evaluation of a merger’s competitive effects may take into account concentration beyond deposits, including the ability of the resulting IDI to better meet the needs of the community to be served, (ii) the FDIC may require divestitures to be completed before allowing bank merger transactions to be consummated, (iii) the FDIC expects to hold public hearings for mergers resulting in IDIs that have $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, and (iv) mergers resulting in IDIs that have $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets will be subject to added scrutiny. The FDIC statement of policy will apply where the surviving bank is a state bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve system. In September 2024, the Department of Justice withdrew from the 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines and issued a banking addendum to its 2023 Merger Guidelines, which will apply to all bank mergers. The banking addendum to the 2023 Merger Guidelines provides that the Department of Justice will evaluate potential harms to more narrowly defined customer markets and that the federal bank regulators may, at their discretion, use their own methods to evaluate bank mergers. We are unable to predict what impact the executive order, the FDIC statement of policy, the Department of Justice withdrawal from the 1995 Bank Merger Guidelines and the issuance of a banking addendum to the 2023 Merger Guidelines, or any other responsive changes to such guidelines, will have on the timing of or ability to obtain regulatory approvals of future mergers.
In July 2024, the FDIC issued a proposed rule to amend its regulations under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, which generally provides that no person, acting directly or indirectly, may acquire control of an IDI unless the person has given the appropriate federal banking agency prior notice of the proposed transaction, and the agency has not disapproved the transaction. The proposed rule would eliminate the existing exemption from FDIC approval for acquisitions of voting securities at the bank holding company level for which the Federal Reserve reviews a notice pursuant to the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978.
Holding Company Control of Nonbanks.

With some exceptions, the BHCA also prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring or retaining direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company, or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing, or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries. The principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non-bank activities that, by statute or by Federal Reserve regulation or order, have been identified as activities so closely related to the business of banking as to be a proper incident thereto.
Tying Arrangements
.

We are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, sale or lease of property or furnishing of services. For example, with certain exceptions, neither the Company nor its subsidiaries may condition an extension of credit to a customer on either (i) a requirement that the customer obtain additional services provided by us; or (ii) an agreement by the customer to refrain from obtaining other services from a competitor.
Support of Subsidiary Banks
.

Under Federal Reserve policy and federal law, the Company is required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to Umpqua Bank, including at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources, and it may not be in our, or our shareholders’ best interests to do so. This means that the Company is required to commit resources, as necessary, to support Umpqua Bank. Any capital loans the Company makes to Umpqua Bank are subordinate to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of Umpqua Bank.
State Law Restrictions
.

As a Washington corporation, the Company is subject to certain limitations and restrictions under applicable Washington corporate law. For example, state law restrictions in Washington include limitations and restrictions relating to indemnification of directors, distributions to shareholders, transactions involving directors, officers or interested shareholders, maintenance of books, records and minutes, and observance of certain corporate formalities. 
Federal and State Regulation of Umpqua Bank
General
.

The deposits of Umpqua Bank, an Oregon state-chartered commercial bank in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington, are insured by the FDIC. As a result, Umpqua Bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the DCBS and the FDIC. These agencies have the authority to prohibit banks from engaging in what they believe constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices. Furthermore, under the FDIA, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC if the FDIC finds that the IDI has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order, or condition imposed by the FDIC. With respect to branches of Umpqua Bank, the Bank is also subject to certain laws and regulations governing its activities in the states in which we operate.

State Bank Regulation
.

Umpqua Bank, as an Oregon state-chartered bank, is primarily subject to the state-level supervision and regulation of the DCBS. In addition, Umpqua Bank is subject to regulation by the financial institution oversight authorities in the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Washington. Our primary state regulator regularly examines the Bank or participates in joint examinations with the FDIC; these agencies may prohibit the Bank from engaging in what they believe constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices.
Consumer Protection
.

The Bank is subject to a variety of federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations that govern its relationship with consumers, including laws and regulations that impose certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which we take deposits, make, and collect loans, and provide other services. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may subject the Bank to various penalties, including but not limited to, enforcement actions, injunctions, fines, civil monetary penalties, criminal penalties, punitive damages, and the loss of certain contractual rights. As an IDI with assets of $10 billion or more, the CFPB has primary enforcement and enforcement authority for federal consumer financial laws over the Bank. This includes the right to obtain information about the Bank’s activities and compliance systems and procedures and to detect and assess risks to consumers and markets. The CFPB engages in several activities, including (i) investigating consumer complaints about credit cards and mortgages, (ii) launching supervisory programs, (iii) conducting research for and developing mandatory financial product disclosures, and (iv) engaging in consumer financial protection rulemaking. Umpqua Bank has established a compliance management system designed to ensure consumer protection. In October 2024, the CFPB adopted a final rule regarding personal financial data rights that applies to financial institutions that offer consumer deposit accounts such as Umpqua Bank. Covered financial institutions are required to provide consumers electronic access to 24 months of transaction data and certain account information under the final rule and are prohibited from imposing any fees or charges for maintaining or providing access to such data. The final rule also imposes data accuracy, retention, and other obligations. These requirements will apply to Umpqua Bank beginning on April 1, 2027, and we will continue to evaluate the final rule and the impact on Umpqua Bank. In December 2024, the CFPB adopted a final rule that significantly reforms the regulatory framework governing overdraft practices applicable to banks, including Umpqua Bank, that have more than $10 billion in assets. The rule will become effective on October 1, 2025. The rule modifies or eliminates several long-standing exclusions from requirements generally applicable to consumer credit that previously exempted certain overdraft practices. The rule also generally requires banks to restructure many overdraft fees, overdraft lines of credit, and other overdraft practices as separate consumer credit accounts that would be subject to those requirements.
With the recent change in presidential administration and control of Congress, the scope of regulation by the CFPB and other federal agencies remains uncertain. In February 2025, the acting director of the CFPB directed the CFPB’s staff to cease all supervision and examination activity and stakeholder engagement, stop all work on proposed rulemaking, suspend the effective dates of any finalized but not yet effective rules, and halt other actions relating to investigations, enforcement, and litigation. The extent to which these recent or other future developments will ultimately impact the CFPB’s regulation of the Bank’s business remains uncertain.
Community Reinvestment
.

The CRA requires that, in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their jurisdiction, the Federal Reserve, the OCC or the FDIC evaluate the record of the financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution. A bank’s community reinvestment record is also considered by the applicable banking agencies in evaluating mergers, acquisitions, and applications to open a branch or facility. The Bank’s failure to comply with the CRA could, among other things, result in the denial or delay of such transactions. The Bank received a rating of "Satisfactory" in its most recently completed CRA examination. On October 24, 2023, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC jointly issued a final rule amending the agencies’ CRA regulations to achieve the following goals: (i) encourage banks to expand access to credit, investment and banking services in low- and moderate-income communities, (ii) adapt to changes in the banking industry, including internet and mobile banking, (iii) provide greater clarity and consistency in the application of the CRA regulations, and (iv) tailor CRA evaluations and data collection to bank size and type. A court has issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the federal bank regulators from enforcing the revised regulations pending resolution of the lawsuit challenging the regulations.

Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism and Sanctions.

The BSA requires all financial institutions, including banks, to, among other things, establish a risk-based system of internal controls reasonably designed to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. It includes a variety of recordkeeping and reporting requirements (such as cash and suspicious activity reporting) as well as due diligence/know-your-customer documentation requirements. In June 2024, the United States Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) issued a proposed rule that would amend the anti-money laundering/countering the financing of terrorism (“AML/CFT”) program requirements for all financial institutions subject to the BSA with AML/CFT program obligations, including the Bank. The proposed rule would, among other things, require that (i) financial institutions have a risk assessment process to identify, evaluate, and document the financial institution’s money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activity risks, and (ii) the risk assessment process must be updated on a periodic basis, including when certain material changes occur in the financial institution’s products, services, customer base, intermediaries, and geographic footprint. In July 2024, the OCC, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC each proposed rules to amend their respective BSA compliance program rules to align with FinCEN’s June 2024 proposed rule.
The Patriot Act further augments and strengthens the requirements set forth in the BSA. The Patriot Act, in relevant part, (i) prohibits banks from providing correspondent accounts directly to foreign shell banks; (ii) imposes due diligence requirements on banks opening or holding accounts for foreign financial institutions or wealthy foreign individuals; (iii) requires financial institutions to establish an anti-money-laundering compliance program; and (iv) eliminates civil liability for persons who file suspicious activity reports. The Patriot Act also includes provisions providing the government with power to investigate terrorism, including expanded government access to bank account records. 
Umpqua Bank is also subject to regulation under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Trading with the Enemy Act, as administered by the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“Sanctions Laws”). The Sanctions Laws are intended to restrict transactions with persons, companies, or foreign governments sanctions by U.S. authorities. An institution that fails to meet these standards may be subject to regulatory sanctions, including limitations on growth. Umpqua Bank has established compliance programs designed to comply with the BSA, the Patriot Act and applicable Sanctions Laws.
Transactions with Affiliates; Insider Credit Transactions
.

Transactions between the Bank and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Company or any other subsidiary, on the other hand, are regulated under federal banking law. The Federal Reserve Act imposes quantitative and qualitative requirements and collateral requirements on covered transactions by the Bank with, or for the benefit of, its affiliates. In addition, subsidiary banks of a bank holding company are subject to restrictions on extensions of credit to the holding company or its subsidiaries, on investments in securities of the holding company or its subsidiaries and on the use of their securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. These regulations and restrictions may limit the Company’s ability to obtain funds from Umpqua Bank for its cash needs, including funds for payment of dividends, interest, and operational expenses.
Banks are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, or any related interests of such persons. Extensions of credit (i) must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are at least as stringent as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the lending bank; and (ii) must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to insiders. A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties, regulatory enforcement actions, and other regulatory sanctions. The Umpqua Bank board has established controls to ensure compliance with regulatory expectations around affiliated transactions.
Regulation of Management
.

Federal law (i) sets forth circumstances under which officers or directors of a bank may be removed by the institution’s federal supervisory agency; (ii) places constraints on lending by a bank to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders, and their related interests; and (iii) generally prohibits management personnel of a bank from serving as directors or in other management positions of another financial institution whose assets exceed a specified amount or which has an office within a specified geographic area.
Safety and Soundness Standards
.

Certain non-capital safety and soundness standards are also imposed upon banks. These standards cover internal controls, information systems and internal audit, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, such other operational and managerial standards as the agency determines to be appropriate, and standards for asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation. An institution that fails to meet these standards may be subject to regulatory sanctions, including limitations on growth. Umpqua Bank has established policies and risk management activities designed to ensure the safety and soundness of the Bank.

Interstate Banking and Branching
The Interstate Act together with the Dodd-Frank Act relaxed prior interstate branching restrictions under federal law by permitting, subject to regulatory approval, state and federally chartered commercial banks to establish branches in states where the laws permit banks chartered in such states to establish branches. The Interstate Act requires regulators to consult with community organizations before permitting an interstate institution to close a branch in a low-income area. Federal banking agency regulations prohibit banks from using their interstate branches primarily for deposit production and the federal banking agencies have implemented a loan-to-deposit ratio screen to ensure compliance with this prohibition.
Dividends
Columbia is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and its other subsidiaries. As a bank holding company, Columbia is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to pay dividends under applicable banking laws and regulations. Federal bank regulators are authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. In particular, federal bank regulators have stated that paying dividends that deplete a banking organization’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. In addition, in the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. Federal Reserve policy also provides that a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bank holding company’s capital structure. 
A significant portion of our income comes from dividends from the Bank, which is also the primary source of our liquidity. In addition to the restrictions discussed above, the Bank is subject to limitations under Oregon law regarding the level of dividends that it may pay to the Company. Oregon law provides that a bank may not pay dividends greater than the bank’s unreserved retained earnings, deducting therefrom, to the extent not already charged against earnings or reflected in a reserve, all bad debts, which are debts on which interest is past due and unpaid for at least six months, unless the debt is fully secured and in the process of collection; all other assets charged-off as required by Oregon bank regulators or a state or federal examiner; and all accrued expenses, interest and taxes of the institution. Under the Oregon Bank Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, Umpqua Bank is subject to restrictions on the payment of cash dividends to its parent company and may be required to receive prior approval in certain circumstances. In addition, state and federal regulatory authorities are authorized to prohibit banks and holding companies from paying dividends that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The Bank currently has an accumulated deficit and is required to seek FDIC and DCBS approval for dividends from Umpqua Bank to the Company.
Regulatory Capital Requirements
The Federal Reserve monitors the capital adequacy of the Company on a consolidated basis, and the FDIC and the DCBS will monitor the capital adequacy of the Bank. The Capital Rules are based on the December 2010 final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards, known as Basel III, of the Basel Committee. As of December 31, 2024, Columbia and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements under the Capital Rules, as described below.
The Capital Rules, among other things (i) include a capital measure called CET1, (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements, and (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital. Under the Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios are (i) 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) 6% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets, and (iii) 8% total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets.
The Capital Rules also require an institution to establish a capital conservation buffer of CET1 in an amount above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for “adequately capitalized” institutions equal to 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and the institution’s “eligible retained income” (that is, the greater of (i) net income for the preceding four quarters, net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income and (ii) average net income over the preceding four quarters).
17

t
s
The Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. The Capital Rules also generally preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, from being counted as Tier 1 capital for most bank holding companies.
In addition, the Company and the Bank are subject to the final rule adopted by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC in July 2019 relating to simplifications of the capital rules applicable to non-advanced approaches banking organizations. These rules became effective for the Company on April 1, 2020 and provide for simplified capital requirements relating to the threshold deductions for mortgage servicing assets, deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that a banking organization could not realize through net operating loss carry backs, and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions, as well as the inclusion of minority interests in regulatory capital.
In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms. The standards are commonly referred to as “Basel IV.” Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee’s standardized approach for credit risk (including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain “unconditionally cancellable commitments,” such as home equity lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. The Basel framework standards have been generally effective since January 1, 2023, with an aggregate output floor phasing in through January 1, 2028. 
The Bank is also subject to the prompt corrective action regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the FDIA. See “Prompt Corrective Action Framework” below.
Prompt Corrective Action Framework
The FDIA requires the federal bank regulators to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that fail to meet specified capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital categories (“well-capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized”), and the federal bank regulators are required to take certain mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized. The severity of these mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. Generally, subject to a narrow exception, the FDIA requires the regulator to appoint a receiver or conservator for an institution that is critically undercapitalized.
Under the rules currently in effect, the following table presents the requirements for an IDI to be classified as well-capitalized or adequately capitalized:
“Well-capitalized”
“Adequately capitalized”
Total capital ratio of at least 10%,
Total capital ratio of at least 8%,
Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8%,
Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6%
CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%,
CET1 ratio of at least 4.5%, and
Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5%, and
Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 4%.
Not subject to any order or written directive requiring a specific capital level.
An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. A bank’s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the Bank’s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company and the Bank met the capital requirements to be well-capitalized with CET1 capital ratios of 10.54% and 11.37%, respectively, Tier 1 capital ratios of 10.54% and 11.37%, respectively, total capital ratios of 12.75% and 12.42%, respectively, and Tier 1 leverage ratios of 8.31% and 8.97%, respectively.

s
An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal bank regulator. Under the FDIA, in order for the capital restoration plan to be accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency, a bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution will comply with its capital restoration plan, subject to certain limitations. The bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance. The obligation of a controlling bank holding company under the FDIA to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of 5% of an undercapitalized subsidiary’s assets or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions and capital distributions, establishing any branches, or engaging in any new line of business, except in accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with the approval of the FDIC. Institutions that are undercapitalized or significantly undercapitalized and either fail to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fail to implement an approved capital restoration plan may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions failing to submit or implement an acceptable capital restoration plan are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator.
Resolution Planning
In June 2024, the FDIC issued a final rule that revised its then existing rule that requires the submission of resolution plans by IDI’s with $50 billion or more in total assets. Under the final rule, IDI’s with more than $50 billion in total assets, but less than $100 billion in total assets, must submit a full informational filing to the FDIC every three years, with interim supplements to be submitted in years that an informational filing is not required. The final rule also contains a credibility standard which provides that an informational filing can be found “not credible” if the information and analysis in the informational filing are not supported with observable and verifiable capabilities and date and reasonable projections, or the IDI fails to comply in all material respects with the requirements of the final rule. The information filing does not require, among other things, development of an identified strategy for resolution of the IDI in a failure scenario. Umpqua Bank’s initial informational filing under the final rule will be due on or before April 1, 2026.
Brokered Deposits
The FDIA prohibits an IDI from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the Bank’s normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited) unless it is well-capitalized or is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A depository institution that is adequately capitalized and accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates. In July 2024, the FDIC issued a proposed rule to amend the FDIC’s brokered deposit regulations. The proposed rule would, among other things, (i) significantly expand the definition of deposit broker by replacing the “matchmaking” prong with a broader definition relating to “deposit allocation” services, eliminating the exclusive arrangement exception, and including a fee-based trigger, (ii) consider the third party’s intent in placing deposits at a particular IDI when analyzing the applicability of the primary purpose exception, (iii) eliminate the ability for an agent or nominee to submit their own primary purpose exception applications, instead requiring that the application be submitted by each IDI for each specific deposit placement arrangement it has with a third party, (iv) narrows the current 25 percent exemption so that it is only available to broker-dealers or investment advisers registered with the SEC who place less than 10 percent of the total assets under management into non-maturity accounts at one or more IDIs, and (v) eliminate the enabling transactions designated business exception.
Regulatory Oversight and Examination
The Federal Reserve conducts periodic inspections of bank holding companies. The supervisory objectives of the inspection program are to ascertain whether the financial strength of the bank holding company is being maintained on an ongoing basis and to determine the effects or consequences of transactions between a holding company or its non-banking subsidiaries and its subsidiary banks.
Banks are subject to periodic examinations by their primary regulators. Bank examinations have evolved from reliance on transaction testing in assessing a bank’s condition to a risk-focused approach. These examinations are extensive and cover the entire breadth of operations of the Bank. Generally, FDIC safety and soundness examinations for a bank of our size are completed on an annual basis through the execution of a quarterly focal review process. The FDIC and state bank regulatory agencies complete these examinations on a combined schedule.
19
Table of 
Conte
n
t
s
The CFPB has primary examination and enforcement authority over institutions with assets of $10 billion or more, including the Bank, with respect to various federal consumer protection laws, and we are subject to continued examination by the FDIC on certain consumer regulations. State authorities are also responsible for monitoring our compliance with all state consumer laws.
The frequency of consumer compliance and CRA examinations is linked to the size of the institution and its compliance and CRA ratings at its most recent examinations. However, the examination authority of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC allows them to examine supervised banks as frequently as deemed necessary based on the condition of the supervised bank or as a result of certain triggering events.
Financial Privacy
Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, as amended, a financial institution may not disclose non-public personal information about a consumer to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution satisfies various disclosure requirements and the consumer has not elected to opt out of the information sharing. The financial institution must provide its customers with a notice of its privacy policies and practices. The Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and other financial regulatory agencies issued regulations implementing notice requirements and restrictions on a financial institution's ability to disclose non-public personal information about consumers to unaffiliated third parties.
In addition, privacy and data protection are areas of increasing state legislative focus, and several states have recently enacted consumer privacy laws that impose significant compliance obligations with respect to personal information. For example, the Company is subject to the CCPA and its implementing regulations. The CCPA gives consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them, and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the right to request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), the right to opt out of the sale of the consumer’s personal information, and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights. The CCPA contains several exemptions, including an exemption applicable to information that is collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, as amended. In November 2020, voters in the CPRA, a ballot measure that amends and supplements the CCPA by, among other things, expanding certain rights relating to personal information and its use, collection, and disclosure by covered businesses. The key provisions of the CPRA became effective on January 1, 2023, with civil and administrative enforcement of the CPRA beginning July 1, 2023. Similar laws may in the future be adopted by other states where the Company does business. The Company has made and will make operational adjustments in accordance with the requirements of the CCPA and other state privacy laws. Furthermore, privacy and data protection areas are expected to receive further attention at the federal level. The potential effects of state or federal privacy and data protection laws on the Company’s business cannot be determined at this time and will depend both on whether such laws are adopted by states in which the Company does business and/or at the federal level and the requirements imposed by any such laws.
Cybersecurity
The federal banking agencies have established certain expectations with respect to an institution's information security and cybersecurity programs, with an increasing focus on risk management, processes related to information technology and operational resiliency, and the use of third parties in the provision of financial services. In October 2016, the federal banking agencies jointly issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on enhanced cybersecurity risk-management and resilience standards that would address five categories of cyber standards which include (i) cyber risk governance, (ii) cyber risk management, (iii) internal dependency management, (iv) external dependency management, and (v) incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. The federal banking agencies have not yet taken further action on these proposed standards. 
State regulators have also been increasingly active in implementing privacy and cybersecurity standards and regulations. Recently, several states have adopted regulations requiring certain financial institutions to implement cybersecurity programs with detailed requirements, including data encryption requirements. Many states have also recently implemented or modified their data breach notification and data privacy requirements. For example, in November 2024, the California Privacy Protection Agency proposed regulations under the CCPA relating to cybersecurity audits, risk assessments, and automated decision-making technology. We expect this trend of state-level cybersecurity regulation to continue and are continually monitoring developments in the states in which the Company operates.

In February 2018, the SEC published interpretive guidance to assist public companies in preparing disclosures about cybersecurity risks and incidents. These SEC guidelines, and any other regulatory guidance, are in addition to notification and disclosure requirements under state and federal banking law and regulations. In addition, on July 26, 2023, the SEC adopted rules that require reporting in Current Reports on Form 8-K of material cybersecurity incidents. These rules also require disclosures in Annual Reports on Form 10-K describing (i) the processes for assessing, identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, (ii) the material effects or reasonably likely material effects of risks from cybersecurity threats and previous cybersecurity incidents, and (iii) the board of directors’ oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats and management’s role and expertise in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. 
In November 2021, the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies adopted a rule regarding notification requirements for banking organizations related to significant computer security incidents. Under the final rule, a bank holding company, such as the Company, and an FDIC-supervised IDI, such as the Bank, are required to notify the Federal Reserve or FDIC, respectively, within 36 hours of incidents that have materially disrupted or degraded, or are reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization’s ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base, jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking organization, or impact the stability of the financial sector.
Corporate Governance and Accounting
SOX addresses, among other things, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information, and penalties for non-compliance. Generally, SOX (i) requires CEOs and CFOs to certify the accuracy of periodic reports filed with the SEC; (ii) imposes specific and enhanced corporate disclosure requirements; (iii) accelerates the time frame for reporting of insider transactions and periodic disclosures by public companies; (iv) requires companies to adopt and disclose information about corporate governance practices, including whether or not they have adopted a code of ethics for senior financial officers and whether the audit committee includes at least one “audit committee financial expert;” and (v) requires the SEC, based on certain enumerated factors, to regularly and systematically review corporate filings.
Deposit Insurance
The Bank’s deposits are insured under the FDIA up to the maximum applicable limits and are subject to deposit insurance assessments designed to tie what banks pay for deposit insurance to the risks they pose. Under the FDIC’s assessment system for determining payments to the DIF, large IDIs with more than $10 billion in assets are assessed under a complex “scorecard” methodology that seeks to capture both the probability that an individual large IDI will fail and the magnitude of the impact on the DIF if such a failure occurs. The assessment base of a large IDI is its total assets less tangible equity. 
In November 2023, the FDIC finalized a rule that imposes special assessments to recover the losses to the DIF resulting from the FDIC’s use, in March 2023, of the systemic risk exception to the least-cost resolution test under the FDIA in connection with the receiverships of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The FDIC estimated in approving the rule that those assessed losses total approximately $16.3 billion. The rule provides that this loss estimate will be periodically adjusted, which will affect the amount of the special assessment. As of September 30, 2024, the FDIC’s total loss estimate was $24.1 billion, of which $18.9 billion will be recovered through the special assessment. Under the final rule, the assessment base is the estimated uninsured deposits that an IDI reported in its December 31, 2022 Call Report, excluding the first $5 billion in estimated uninsured deposits. The special assessments will be collected at an annual rate of approximately 13.4 basis points per year (3.36 basis points per quarter) over eight quarters in 2024 and 2025, with the first assessment period beginning January 1, 2024. Because the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination will be periodically adjusted, the FDIC retains the ability to cease collection early, extend the special assessment collection period and impose a final shortfall special assessment on a one-time basis. In June 2024, due to the increased estimate of losses, the FDIC announced that it projects that the special assessment will be collected for an additional two quarters beyond the initial eight-quarter collection period, at a lower rate. For additional discussion of this special assessment, see the section entitled "Non-Interest Expense" under Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Volcker Rule
The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. The statutory provision is commonly called the “Volcker Rule.” The Volcker Rule does not significantly impact the operations of the Company and the Bank, as we do not have any significant engagement in the businesses prohibited by the Volcker Rule.

Interchange Fees
The Company is subject to rules governing interchange fees, which establish standards for assessing whether the interchange fees that may be charged with respect to certain electronic debit transactions are “reasonable and proportional” to the costs incurred by issuers for processing such transactions.
Interchange fees, or “swipe” fees, are charges that merchants pay to us and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. Under applicable rules, the maximum permissible interchange fee is equal to no more than 21 cents plus 5 basis points of the transaction value for many types of debit interchange transactions. The Federal Reserve also adopted a rule to allow a debit card issuer to recover one cent per transaction for fraud prevention purposes if the issuer complies with certain fraud-related requirements required by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve also has rules governing routing and exclusivity that require issuers to offer two unaffiliated networks for routing transactions on each debit or prepaid product. In October 2023, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule that would reduce the maximum permissible interchange fee to 14.4 cents plus 4 basis points of the transaction value plus 1.3 cents in adjustments for fraud prevention purposes for many types of debit interchange transactions. The proposed rule also included a mechanism to automatically update the maximum permissible interchange fee every two years based on responses to the debit card issuer survey. The proposed rule has yet to be finalized.
Incentive Compensation
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulators and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, including us and the Bank, having at least $1 billion in total assets that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements.
In June 2010, the Federal Reserve and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors.
During the second quarter of 2016, the U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve and the SEC, first proposed revised rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets. In May and July 2024, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the FDIC, the National Credit Union Administration, and the OCC re-proposed the revised rules on incentive-based payment arrangements that prohibit incentive-based compensation the encourages inappropriate risk. However, the Federal Reserve and the SEC have so far declined to join the other U.S. financial regulators in re-proposing the revised rules which are legislatively mandated to be a joint rule among the six aforementioned U.S. financial regulators.
The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as us, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.

In October 2023, Nasdaq adopted a rule as required by the SEC’s 2022 rule-making that requires listed companies to adopt policies mandating the recovery or “clawback” of excess incentive-based compensation earned by a current or former executive officer during the three fiscal years preceding a required accounting restatement, including to correct an error that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period. The excess compensation would be based on the amount the executive officer would have received had the incentive-based compensation been determined using the restated financials. Effective as of December 1, 2023, Columbia adopted a clawback policy in accordance with Nasdaq’s listing standards.
Proposed Legislation
Proposed legislation relating to the banking industry is introduced in almost every legislative session. Certain of such legislation could dramatically affect the regulation of the banking industry. We cannot predict if any such legislation will be adopted or if it is adopted how it would affect the business of Umpqua Bank or the Company.
Effects of Government Monetary Policy
Our earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession, but its open market operations in U.S. government securities, control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the Federal Reserve, and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits influence the growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty.
