Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, on Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2024.
EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW
Financial Performance 
•
Earnings per diluted common share were $2.55 for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $1.78 for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year, was primarily driven by a decrease in non-interest expense due to lower expenses related to the Merger, as the majority were recognized in 2023. In addition, provision for credit losses decreased, primarily due to the initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans that was recorded in the first quarter of 2023, as well as credit migration trends, charge-off activity, changes in the economic forecasts used in credit models, and a recalibration of the commercial CECL model in the first quarter of 2024. These favorable changes were partially offset by a decrease in net interest income.
•
Net interest income was $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities and a shift in the funding mix into higher-cost sources, partially offset by higher average yields on interest-earning assets and higher average balances.
•
Net interest margin, on a tax equivalent basis, was 3.57% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 3.91% for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to higher funding costs that reflect deposit repricing and a shift in product mix. This was partially offset by an increase in interest-earning asset yields given interest rate movements, with the most impactful average rate increase in the loan and leases category. 
•
Non-interest income was $211.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $203.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase was partially due to a favorable change in the net fair value loss of the MSR asset as a result of a $15.9 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a net fair value loss of $28.5 million for the prior year. In addition, there were increases in many other non-interest income categories, largely due to the impact of a full year as a combined company compared to only ten months as a combined company for the prior year, as well as increasing fee-generating product traction with our customer base as we execute our Business Bank of Choice operating strategy. These favorable changes were partially offset by a decrease in other income of $8.0 million, largely driven by interest rate fluctuations impacting the fair value of certain loans held for investment, partially offset by the impact of rate fluctuations on swap derivatives. 
•
Non-interest expense was $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. This reflects a decrease in merger and restructuring expenses of $147.9 million and decreases in FDIC assessments, which was impacted by the $32.9 million special assessment expense that was incurred in 2023. Salaries and employee benefits also decreased, largely due a reduction in employees as a result of Merger synergies realized in 2023 and operational efficiency activities in 2024.

•
Total loans and leases were $37.7 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $239.0 million, or 0.6%, compared to December 31, 2023. The increase in total loans and leases was primarily due to increases in the commercial and commercial real estate loan balances, partially offset by a decrease in residential balances. The increase was driven by commercial line utilization and new originations, partially offset by charge-offs and loan payoffs. Balances were also impacted by a decline in transactional multifamily and residential loans, which trended lower as we organically remix the portfolio into relationship-driven commercial loans.

•
Total deposits were $41.7 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $113.7 million, or 0.3%, from December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in customer deposits with the largest change being in the commercial customer balances, reflective of our Business Bank of Choice operating strategy. This was partially offset by a decrease in brokered deposits. The interest-bearing deposit mix increased mainly due to a migration from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing accounts as customers seek higher rates in the current interest rate environment. 

•
Total consolidated assets were $51.6 billion as of December 31, 2024, compared to $52.2 billion as of December 31, 2023. The reduction is primarily due to decline in investment debt securities, driven by paydowns, calls, maturities, and a reduction in fair value given interest rate changes during the year. Additionally, there was a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, reflecting the deleveraging of wholesale borrowings. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in loans and leases, primarily driven by organic loan growth. 
Credit Quality
•
Non-performing assets increased to $169.6 million, or 0.33% of total assets, as of December 31, 2024, compared to $113.9 million, or 0.22% of total assets, as of December 31, 2023. Non-performing loans were $166.9 million, or 0.44% of total loans and leases, as of December 31, 2024, compared to $112.9 million, or 0.30% of total loans and leases, as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, non-performing loans included $73.6 million in government guarantees. The rise in non-performing assets was mainly due to migration in our SBA portfolio, an owner-occupied commercial real estate property, and the end of certain COVID-related designations in the residential mortgage portfolio.

•
The ACL was $440.8 million, or 1.17% of loans and leases, as of December 31, 2024, a decrease of $23.3 million, as compared to $464.1 million, or 1.24% of loans and leases, as of December 31, 2023. The change in the ACL was due to changes in the economic assumptions used in credit models, credit migration trends, and a recalibration of the commercial CECL model in the first quarter of 2024.
•
The Company had a provision for credit losses of $105.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a provision for credit losses of $213.2 million in the prior year. The decrease in provision expense for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the prior year was due to the prior year including an $88.4 million initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans related to the Merger. This initial provision, as well as changes in the economic assumptions used in credit models and a recalibration of the commercial CECL model in the first quarter of 2024, contributed to the change when compared to the same period in the current year. As a percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, the provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 0.28%, as compared to 0.60% for the prior year.
Liquidity
•
Total cash and cash equivalents were $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2024, a decrease of $284.3 million from December 31, 2023. The Company manages its cash position as part of management's strategy to maintain a high-quality liquid asset position to support balance sheet flexibility, fund growth in lending and investment portfolios, and deleverage the balance sheet by decreasing debt and non-deposit liabilities as economic conditions permit. 
•
Including secured off-balance sheet lines of credit, total available liquidity was $18.0 billion as of December 31, 2024, representing 35% of total assets, 43% of total deposits, and 128% of estimated uninsured deposits.
Capital
•
The Company's total risk-based capital ratio was 12.8% and its CET1 risk-based capital ratio was 10.5% as of December 31, 2024, as compared to 11.9% and 9.6%, respectively, as of December 31, 2023. 
•
The Company paid cash dividends of $1.44 per common share during the year ended December 31, 2024.

California Wildfires
•
Southern California has experienced unprecedented wildfires in recent years, which have impacted the Bank's customers and associates. While some of our businesses and associates have been directly affected by the damage, the response from our teams across the organization has been truly inspiring. As a company, we have established grant programs to support communities in the wake of disasters like wildfires. We actively collaborate with community organizations to aid in recovery efforts as they unfold. Our commitment to our communities, customers, and associates is unwavering, and we are dedicated to supporting, rebuilding, and restoring the communities affected by these devastating fires.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 
The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and follow general practices within the financial services industry, in which the Company operates. This preparation requires management to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions, and judgments reflected in the financial statements. Certain estimates inherently have a greater reliance on the use of assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. 
Management believes the ACL and goodwill estimates are important to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and requires difficult, subjective, or complex judgments and, therefore, management considers them to be critical accounting estimates.
Allowance for Credit Losses 
The ACL represents management's best estimate of lifetime credit losses for loans and leases and unfunded commitments. The ACL was $440.8 million at December 31, 2024 and $464.1 million at December 31, 2023. 
Under CECL, Management has flexibility in selecting the methodology for estimating expected credit losses, which must be calculated over the asset’s contractual term, and adjusted for prepayments, utilizing quantitative and qualitative factors. Management uses complex models to forecast future economic conditions based on specific macroeconomic variables for each loan and lease portfolio
. 
The adequacy of the ACL is monitored regularly, considering factors such as: CECL model outputs; loan portfolio quality and risk ratings; economic conditions; loan concentrations and growth rates; past-due and non-performing trends; specific loss estimates for significant problem loans; historical charge-off and recovery experience. As of December 31, 2024, the Bank used Moody's Analytics' November 2024 consensus forecast to estimate the ACL. 
To assess sensitivity, the Bank applied the Moody's Analytics' November 2024 S2 scenario, which predicts a 75% probability of better economic performance and a 25% probability of worse performance. For additional information related to the economic scenario, see Note 6 – 
Allowance for Credit Losses 
in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
This scenario would result in a quantitative lifetime loss estimate approximately 1.2 times our modeled period-end ACL, an increase of approximately $87 million, without qualitative adjustments. This analysis pertains solely to the modeled credit loss estimate and does not encompass the overall period-end ACL, which incorporates qualitative adjustments. 
The determination of the ACL considers both quantitative and qualitative factors. This sensitivity analysis does not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the ACL or what the ACL would be under these economic circumstances. Instead, it highlights the impact of adverse macroeconomic changes on modeled loss estimates. The hypothetical determination does not incorporate management judgment or other qualitative factors that could be applied in the actual estimation of the ACL and does not imply any expected future deterioration in loss rates.

Since economic conditions and forecasts can change, and future events are inherently difficult to predict, the estimated credit losses on loans, and therefore the appropriateness of the ACL, could change significantly. It is challenging to estimate how changes in any single economic factor or input might affect the overall allowance, as many factors and inputs are considered. These changes may not occur at the same rate or be consistent across all product types. Additionally, improvements in one factor may offset deterioration in others.
For additional information related to the Company's ACL, see Note 1 – 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Goodwill
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of October 31 each year, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. 
Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount. 
If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the difference is the amount of impairment and goodwill is written down to the fair value of the reporting unit. The
 Company has a single reporting unit. 
In testing goodwill, the Company may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In this qualitative assessment, the Company evaluates events and circumstances which may include, but are not limited to
: 
the general economic environment; banking industry and market conditions; 
a significant adverse change in legal factors; significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit; and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. 
If the quantitative impairment test is required or the decision to bypass the qualitative assessment is elected, the Company performs the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The determination of the fair value of a reporting unit is a
 subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments about economic and industry factors and the growth and earnings prospects of the Bank. Variability in the market and changes in assumptions or subjective measurements used to estimate fair value are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.
Based on the results of the annual goodwill impairment test, it was determined that no goodwill impairment charges were required as our single reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying amount. The determination of the fair value is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. The Company determined the fair value utilizing average acquisition multiples as well as calculating its market capitalization based on the closing price of the Company’s stock at the measurement date, incorporating an additional control premium, and comparing this market-based fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of the Company. The percentage at which the fair value exceeded the carrying value is approximately 25%. As of October 31, 2024, a decrease in market multiples and utilizing an average stock price for market capitalization would reduce estimated entity fair value by approximately $1 million and would not result in any impairment. 
As of December 31, 2024
, we determined there were no events or circumstances which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying amount.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Columbia's financial results for any periods ended prior to February 28, 2023, the Merger Date, reflect UHC results only on a standalone basis. Accordingly, Columbia's reported financial results for the first quarter of 2023 reflect only UHC financial results through the closing of the Merger. As a result of these two factors, Columbia's financial results for the year ended December 31, 2023, may not be directly comparable to prior or future reported periods.

Comparison of current year to prior year
For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company had net income of $533.7 million, compared to net income of $348.7 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in net income was mainly attributable to decreases in non-interest expense and provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decrease in net interest income. The $208.0 million decrease in non-interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in merger and restructuring expenses, as the majority of the merger expenses associated with the Merger were recognized in 2023. The decrease of $107.3 million in provision for credit losses was impacted by the initial provision of $88.4 million for historical Columbia non-PCD loans that was recorded in the first quarter of 2023, in addition to credit migration trends, charge-off activity, changes in the economic forecasts used in credit models, and the recalibration of the commercial CECL model in the first quarter of 2024. The decrease of $74.8 million in net interest income was due to higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities and a shift in the funding mix into higher-cost sources, partially offset by higher average yields on interest-earning assets and a larger average balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company paid down term debt and reduced brokered deposit balances during the year to continue to rebalance our funding sources in support of our liquidity management program and lower the cost of liabilities. 
During the first quarter of 2024, the Company conducted an enterprise-wide evaluation of our operations, which resulted in consolidated positions and simplified reporting and organizational structures. As of December 31, 2024, the Company incurred $12.9 million in restructuring expenses, but achieved $82 million in annualized cost savings, or $70 million net of planned reinvestment associated with recent operational initiatives. The Company will continue to invest in customer-focused technology, experienced bankers, and strategic locations going forward. There are five branches slated to open in 2025, as well as technological enhancements that are targeted to create additional operational efficiencies and bring additional revenue opportunities to the Company in the future.
The following table presents the return on average assets (GAAP), average common shareholders' equity (GAAP), and average tangible common shareholders' equity (non-GAAP) for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. For each period presented, the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net income. To the extent return on average common shareholders' equity is used to compare our performance with other financial institutions that do not have merger and acquisition-related intangible assets, we believe it is beneficial to also consider the return on average tangible common shareholders' equity. This measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is also used as part of our incentive compensation program for our executive officers. The return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders' common equity less average goodwill and other intangible assets, net (excluding MSR). The return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction with the return on average common shareholders' equity.

Additionally, management believes 
tangible common equity
 and the
 tangible common equity ratio
 are meaningful measures of capital adequacy. Columbia believes the exclusion of certain intangible assets in the computation of tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio provides a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results and capital of the Company. Tangible common equity is calculated as total shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, net (excluding MSR). In addition, tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets, net (excluding MSR). The tangible common equity ratio is calculated as tangible common shareholders' equity divided by tangible assets. Tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio are considered non-GAAP financial measures and should be viewed in conjunction with total shareholders' equity and the total shareholders' equity ratio.

Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not reviewed or audited. Although we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.

NET INTEREST INCOME 

Net interest income for 2024 was $1.7 billion, a decrease of $74.8 million, or 4%, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease was due to higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities and a shift in the funding mix into higher-cost sources, partially offset by higher average yields on interest-earning assets and a larger average balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year, as a result of the Merger.
The net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets) on a fully tax equivalent basis was 3.57% for 2024, as compared to 3.91% for 2023, a decrease of 34 basis points. This decrease for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the prior year was due to higher funding costs that reflect deposit repricing and a shift in product mix. 
The yield on loans and leases for 2024 and 2023 was 6.15% and 5.95%, respectively, an increase of 20 basis points, primarily attributable to the higher interest rate environment during most of 2024. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 3.21% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to 2.56% for the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase of 65 basis points reflects a mix of higher-cost interest-bearing demand, money market, and time deposits and higher interest rates not offset by a reduction in borrowing and borrowing rates. Our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in the yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds.
The Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by 0.50% in September 2024 and an additional 0.25% in both November and December 2024. During the January 2025 meeting, the Federal Reserve maintained the target rate at 4.25%-4.50%. Between March 2022 and July 2023, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 5.25%. During that period, our net interest margin expanded as our balance sheet became increasingly profitable due to active rate increases by the Federal Reserve and the lagged impact to deposit pricing compared to earning asset repricing. After the Federal Reserve ceased increasing the federal funds rate, we experienced an increase in our funding costs that outpaced the increase in our earning asset yields, as our deposits continued to reprice higher and our funding base experienced a shift toward higher-cost sources as Federal Reserve actions reduced available liquidity within the banking industry. As a result, our net interest margin contracted during the latter half of 2023 due to the impact of higher funding costs and minimal change to the average yield on earning assets. Our net interest margin began to stabilize in the 3.5% to 3.6% range beginning in February 2024, following a comprehensive review related to how we evaluate and approve deposit pricing. Further, the impact of balance sheet composition changes and the higher interest rate environment shifted the interest rate sensitivity position of the balance sheet to a liability sensitive position as of December 31, 2024 from an asset sensitive position at the onset of the rising rate environment.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The Company had a $105.9 million provision for credit losses for 2024, as compared to a $213.2 million provision for credit losses for 2023. The change was primarily driven by the $88.4 million initial provision for historical Columbia non-PCD loans that was recorded in the first quarter of 2023, in addition to credit migration trends, charge-off activity, and changes in the economic forecasts used in credit models. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2024, we recalibrated the commercial CECL model to be more reflective of the post-Merger loan portfolio after a full year operating as a combined organization. We believe the recalibrated model is more reflective of the quality of our underwriting and borrower profiles. As a percentage of average outstanding loans and leases, the provision for credit losses recorded for 2024 was 0.28%, as compared to 0.60% for the prior period. 
Net charge-offs were $129.2 million for 2024, or 0.34% of average loans and leases, compared to net charge-offs of $96.7 million, or 0.27% of average loans and leases, for 2023. Net charge-offs in the FinPac portfolio were $87.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $87.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net charge-offs for the Bank were $41.6 million and $9.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net charge-offs for the Bank in 2024 reflect the transition to a more typical credit environment after a period of exceptional quality and a charge-off in the first quarter of 2024 centered in a single commercial credit.

Typically, loans in non-accrual status will not have an ACL as they will be written down to their net realizable value or charged off. However, the net realizable value for homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements are determined by the loss given default calculated by the CECL model, and therefore, homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements on non-accrual will have an ACL amount until they become 181 days past due, at which time they are charged off. The non-accrual leases and equipment finance agreements of $21.0 million as of December 31, 2024 have a related ACL of $18.3 million, with the remaining loans written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less estimated costs to sell, and are expected to be resolved with no additional material loss, absent further decline in market prices.

Service charges on deposits, card-based fees, and financial services and trust revenue increased in 2024 compared to 2023. The increases reflect the impact of a full year as a combined company compared to only ten months as a combined company for the prior year period, as well as increasing fee-generating product traction with our customer base as we execute our Business Bank of Choice operating strategy. We continue to focus on generating sustainable core fee income with new and existing customers. 
Residential mortgage banking revenue increased in 2024 compared to 2023. The variance was due to a favorable change in the net fair value loss of the MSR asset as a result of a $15.9 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a net fair value loss of $28.5 million for the same period in 2023, which is inclusive of MSR hedge losses of $8.6 million for the current year compared to $4.7 million in the prior year. While there was an increase in the origination and sale of mortgages during 2024 when compared to 2023, it was more than offset by a decrease in servicing revenue. The decrease in servicing revenue was expected for 2024 due to a reduction in the serviced loan portfolio size as result of the September 2023 sale of approximately one-third of the MSR portfolio. This sale was the result of strategic actions taken by the Company to restructure its mortgage business given the lower mortgage origination volume in the higher rate environment and focus on relationship banking that drives balanced growth in loans, deposits, and core fee income. These changes were intended to reduce expenses, limit the impact of fair value changes to the statement of income, and moderate portfolio mortgage growth.
(Loss) gain on loan and lease sales, net had an unfavorable change in 2024 compared to 2023, largely driven by lower volume of SBA loan sales combined with strategic sales of existing loans that had greater potential for charge-offs in the future.
Other income in 2024 compared to 2023 decreased primarily due to an unfavorable change of $13.1 million in the fair value of certain loans held for investment, as the impact of interest rate fluctuations resulted in a loss of $10.5 million in the current year as compared to a gain of $2.6 million in the prior year. The decrease was partially offset by the impact of rate fluctuations on swap derivatives with a gain in the current year compared to a loss in the prior year, resulting in a favorable change of $6.3 million.

Salaries and employee benefits decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to a reduction in employees related to the merger synergies realized in 2023 and the additional operational efficiency activities in 2024, partially offset by the current year including a full year as a combined company, compared to only ten months during the year ended December 31, 2023.
FDIC assessments decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 due to the prior period including $32.9 million in expense related to the FDIC special assessment to replenish the DIF following bank closures in March 2023, whereas the current period includes $5.7 million in FDIC special assessment expense.
Merger and restructuring expense decreased in 2024 compared to 2023, with the largest drivers of the decrease being lower legal and professional fees and premises and equipment expense related to the Merger. Columbia closed the Merger and completed the core systems conversion during the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in Merger expenses was partially offset by $12.9 million in restructuring expenses during the year ended December 31, 2024.
INCOME TAXES

Our consolidated effective tax rate for 2024 was 25.7%, compared to 26.0% for 2023. The 2024 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 21% principally because of state taxes, net tax-exempt income on investment securities, non-deductible FDIC assessments, and tax credits and benefits arising from low-income housing investments. Refer to Note 25 – 
Income Taxes

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

Cash and cash equivalents were $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2024, compared to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2023. Excess cash was used to pay down borrowings, as well as to fund loan portfolio growth of $239.0 million.
INVESTMENT SECURITIES 

The composition of our investment securities portfolio reflects management's investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of interest income. The investment securities portfolio provides a vehicle for the investment of available funds, a source of liquidity (by pledging as collateral or through repurchase agreements) and collateral for certain public funds deposits.
Equity and other securities consist primarily of investments in fixed income mutual funds to support our CRA initiatives and securities invested in rabbi trusts for the benefit of certain current or former executives and employees as required by the underlying agreements. Equity and other securities were $78.1 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $77.0 million as of December 31, 2023.

Investment debt securities available for sale were $8.3 billion as of December 31, 2024, compared to $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to paydowns, calls, and maturities of $552.4 million and a decrease of $150.8 million in fair value of investment securities available for sale, due to changes in market interest rates during the period, partially offset by net accretion and purchases, which have been focused on CRA qualifying investments.

The weighted average yields represent a projected yield to maturity given current cash flow projections for MBS/CMOs and is a yield to worst for callable securities. For adjustable MBS, the projected book yield represents the yield to maturity based on current index levels. Yields are calculated on an amortized cost basis and are stated on a federal tax equivalent basis of 21%.

The mortgage-related securities in the table above include both pooled mortgage-backed issues and high-quality collateralized mortgage obligation structures, with an average duration of 5.1 years. These mortgage-related securities provide yield spread to U.S. Treasury or agency securities; however, the cash flows arising from them can be volatile due to refinancing of the underlying mortgage loans. 
We review investment securities on an ongoing basis for the presence of impairment, taking into consideration current market conditions, fair value in relationship to cost, extent and nature of the change in fair value, issuer rating changes and trends, whether we intend to sell a security or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost basis of the investment, which may be maturity, and other factors. 
As December 31, 2024, the available for sale investment portfolio had gross unrealized losses of $591.5 million. Unrealized losses included unrealized losses on mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations of $485.4 million. The unrealized losses were primarily attributable to changes in market interest rates or the widening of market spreads subsequent to the initial purchase of these securities and are not attributable to changes in credit quality. In the opinion of management, no ACL was considered necessary on these debt securities as of December 31, 2024.
RESTRICTED EQUITY SECURITIES

Restricted equity securities were $150.0 million and $179.3 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, the majority of which represents the Bank's investment in the FHLB. The decrease is attributable to redemptions of FHLB stock due to decreased FHLB borrowing activity during the period. FHLB stock is carried at par and does not have a readily determinable fair value. Ownership of FHLB stock is restricted to the FHLB and member institutions, and can only be purchased and redeemed at par. As of December 31, 2024, the Bank's minimum required investment in FHLB stock was $149.5 million. 
LOANS AND LEASES
Total loans and leases outstanding as of December 31, 2024 were $37.7 billion, an increase of $239.0 million compared to December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to organic loan growth of $538.6 million, partially offset by charge-offs of $151.2 million and loan sales of $148.5 million. The loan to deposit ratio as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023 was 90%.

Loan Origination/Risk Management

The Bank has certain lending policies and procedures in place that are designed to maximize loan income within an acceptable level of risk. Management reviews and approves these policies and procedures on a regular basis. A reporting system supplements the review process by providing management with frequent reports related to loan production, loan quality, concentrations of credit, loan delinquencies and non-performing and potential problem loans. Diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of managing risk associated with fluctuations in economic conditions. 
The Bank maintains an independent loan review department that reviews and validates the credit risk program on a periodic basis. Results of these reviews are presented to management and the appropriate committees of our board of directors. The loan review process evaluates that the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel are in line with our policies and procedures.
Commercial Real Estate and Commercial Loans
Commercial real estate and commercial loans are the largest classifications within earning assets, representing 41% and 20%, respectively, of average earning assets for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to 40% and 20%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in commercial real estate and commercial loan balances between December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was driven by commercial line utilization and new originations, partially offset by loan payoffs.
Delinquency and non-accrual loan movements during the period reflect an anticipated move toward a normalized credit environment following a phase of exceptional high credit quality. Non-performing loans as of December 31, 2024 included $73.6 million in government guarantees on the commercial real estate, commercial, and residential portfolios, which offsets our credit exposure in those portfolios.

Commercial Real Estate Loans
The commercial real estate portfolio includes loans to developers and institutional sponsors supporting income-producing or for-sale commercial real estate properties. We mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with projected cash flow in excess of the debt service requirement. Commercial real estate loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrower's ability to operate profitably and are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The properties securing the commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location. This diversity helps reduce the exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry. 
Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on debt service coverage, collateral, and risk grade criteria. As a general rule, we avoid financing single-purpose projects unless other underwriting factors are present to help mitigate risk. Third-party experts are also utilized to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting market areas we serve. In addition, management tracks the level of owner-occupied commercial real estate loans versus non-owner occupied loans. Owner-occupied real estate loans are based on cash flows from ongoing operations and the borrower must generally occupy more than 50% of rentable space or pay more than 50% of rents. At December 31, 2024, approximately 26.9% of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loan portfolio were secured by owner-occupied properties.
As of December 31, 2024, the commercial real estate loan portfolio was $19.6 billion, an increase of $113.2 million compared to December 31, 2023, driven by construction and development loan and line utilization, offset by loan payoffs. Commercial real estate concentrations are managed with a goal of optimizing relationship-driven commercial loans, as well as geographic and business diversity, primarily in our footprint.

Loans secured by multifamily properties, including construction, represented 19% of the total loan portfolio at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. These assets continue to perform well due to demand for rental properties in our geographical footprint. Although management believes such concentrations have no more than the normal risk of collectability, a substantial decline in the economy in general, material increases in interest rates, changes in tax and rent control policies, tightening credit or refinancing markets, or a decline in real estate values in the Bank's primary geographic footprint in particular, could have an adverse impact on the repayment of these loans. 
Loans secured by office properties, which are predominantly located in suburban markets, represented approximately 8% of our total loan portfolio at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and were comprised of 57% non-owner occupied, 40% owner occupied, and 3% construction loans at December 31, 2024, compared to 57% non-owner occupied, 39% owner occupied, and 4% construction loans at December 31, 2023. Excluding floating rate loans, which have already repriced to prevailing rates, only 5% of our office portfolio reprices through 2025.

Commercial Loans and Leases
Commercial loans are made to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs, equipment purchases, or other projects. The Bank focuses on borrowers doing business within our geographic markets. Commercial loans are generally underwritten individually and secured with the assets of the company and/or the personal guarantee of the business owners. Underwriting standards are designed to promote relationship banking rather than transactional banking. Once it is determined that the borrower’s management possesses sound ethics and solid business acumen, current and projected cash flows are examined to determine the ability of the borrower to repay their obligations as agreed.

Commercial loans and leases are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial loans and leases are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets such as accounts receivable or inventory and may incorporate a personal guarantee; however, some short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. As of December 31, 2024, commercial loans held in our loan portfolio were $10.0 billion, an increase of $271.7 million compared to December 31, 2023, which is mainly attributable to relationship driven commercial loan growth and line utilization. 
Lease and equipment financing products are designed to address the diverse financing needs of small to large companies, primarily for the acquisition of equipment. The leases and equipment finance portfolio represented 17% of the commercial portfolio and 4% of the total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2024, as compared to 18% of the commercial portfolio and 5% of the total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2023. The leasing portfolio has had non-performing leases and charge-offs centered in the trucking and transportation portion of the portfolio. Net charge-offs in the FinPac lease portfolio were $87.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $87.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Net charge-offs were up $27.6 million in the remaining commercial portfolio from the prior year, largely due to a charge-off on a single commercial credit in the first quarter as well as the transition to a more typical credit environment after a period of exceptional quality. Delinquencies and non-accrual loan movements in the transportation and trucking portion of the FinPac lease portfolio over the year were anticipated and a slow recovery is in process for this portfolio.

Residential Real Estate Loans
Residential real estate loans represent mortgage loans and lines of credit to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence. The properties securing our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are primarily located within our geographic footprint. We originate first-lien residential home mortgages considered to be of prime quality. We generally hold variable-rate loans in our portfolio and sell conforming fixed-rate loans to third parties for which representations are made that the loans meet certain underwriting and collateral documentation standards.

The Bank underwrites all residential mortgage applications centrally, with a focus on higher quality borrowers. We do not originate residential mortgages that allow negative amortization or allow the borrower multiple payment options. Residential mortgages are originated based on a completed full appraisal during the credit underwriting process. The values are updated in compliance with applicable regulations to facilitate our portfolio management, as well as our workout and loss mitigation functions.
As of December 31, 2024, residential real estate loans held in our loan portfolio were $8.0 billion, a decrease of $130.3 million as compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to greater originations of loans sold on the secondary market, rather than being retained in our loans held for investment portfolio. 
Consumer Loans
Consumer loans, including secured and unsecured personal loans, home equity and personal lines of credit, and motor vehicle loans, decreased $15.6 million to $180.1 million 
as of 
December 31, 2024, as compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease was due to normal business activity. Consumer loans are originated utilizing a credit scoring analysis to supplement the underwriting process. To monitor and manage consumer loan risk, policies and procedures are developed and modified, as needed, jointly by line and staff personnel. This activity, coupled with relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers, minimizes risk. Additionally, trend and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis.

ASSET QUALITY AND NON-PERFORMING ASSETS
The Bank manages asset quality and controls credit risk through diversification of the loan and lease portfolio and the application of policies designed to promote sound underwriting and loan and lease monitoring practices. The Bank's Credit Quality Administration department is charged with monitoring asset quality, establishing credit policies and procedures, and enforcing the consistent application of these policies and procedures across the Bank. Reviews of non-performing, past due loans and leases and larger credits, designed to identify potential charges to the allowance for credit losses, and to determine the adequacy of the allowance, are conducted on an ongoing basis. These reviews consider such factors as the financial strength of borrowers, the value of the applicable collateral, loan and lease loss experience, estimated loan and lease losses, growth in the loan and lease portfolio, prevailing economic conditions, and other factors.

Excludes certain mortgage loans guaranteed by GNMA, which Columbia has the unilateral right to repurchase but has not done so, totaling $2.4 million as of December 31, 2024 and $1.0 million at December 31, 2023.

As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately $110.7 million of loans and leases, or 0.29% of total loans and leases, modified due to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, as compared to $138.1 million or 0.37% as of December 31, 2023. 
A decline in economic conditions and other factors could adversely impact individual borrowers or the loan portfolio in general. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that loans will not become 90 days or more past due, placed on non-accrual status, restructured, or transferred to other real estate owned in the future. As of December 31, 2024, there was an increase in non-performing loans as compared to December 31, 2023, which is representative of a more normalized credit environment.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

The ACL represents management's best estimate of lifetime credit losses for loans and leases and unfunded commitments. The ACL totaled $440.8 million as of December 31, 2024, a decrease of $23.3 million from the $464.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The changes in the ACL estimate during the year ended December 31, 2024 reflect credit migration trends, changes in the economic assumptions used in the credit models, and the recalibration of the commercial CECL model during the first quarter of 2024.

To calculate the ACL, the CECL models use a forecast of future economic conditions and are dependent upon specific macroeconomic variables that are relevant to each of the Bank's loan and lease portfolios, as well as qualitative factors to address uncertainty not measured within the quantitative analysis. In estimating the December 31, 2024 ACL, the Bank used Moody's Analytics' November 2024 consensus economic forecast to project the variables used in the models and used upward qualitative overlays, mainly in the commercial portfolio, to align with the S2 scenario and to account for the transportation segment of the lease portfolio. The 2024 forecast is projecting higher GDP growth and unemployment rates with average federal funds rates trending lower. Refer to Note 6 – 
Allowance for Credit Losses
 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Refer to Note 1 – 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the ACL methodology. 
The models for calculating the ACL are sensitive to changes to economic variables, which could result in volatility as these assumptions change over time. We believe that the ACL as of December 31, 2024 is sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and in credit commitments outstanding as of that date based on the information available. If the economic conditions decline, the Bank may need additional provisions for credit losses in future periods.

Residential MSR are adjusted to fair value quarterly with the change recorded in residential mortgage banking revenue on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and borrowers are able to take advantage of a refinance incentive, prepayments increase, and the total value of existing servicing rights declines as expectations of future servicing fee collections decline. Historically, the fair value of our residential MSR will increase as market rates for mortgage loans rise and decrease if market rates fall. 
Due to changes to inputs in the valuation model including changes in discount rates and prepayment speeds, the fair value of the MSR asset increased by $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to a decrease of $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The fair value of the MSR asset decreased by $12.6 million in 2024 due to the passage of time, including the impact of regularly scheduled repayments, paydowns, and payoffs, as compared to a decrease of $17.7 million in 2023. 
In September 2023, the Company closed the sale of $57.3 million in mortgage servicing rights, which related to the non-relationship component of the serviced loan portfolio.
GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $1.0 billion in goodwill, which was recorded as a result of the Merger. Goodwill is recorded in connection with business combinations and represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment annually, on October 31, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no goodwill impairment losses recognized.
As of December 31, 2024, we had other intangible assets of $484.2 million, compared to $603.7 million as of December 31, 2023. As part of a business combination, the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as core deposits, which includes all deposits except certificates of deposit, was recognized at the acquisition date. Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their respective estimated useful lives. The core deposit intangible assets recorded are amortized on an accelerated basis over a period of 10 years using the sum-of-the-years-digits method. Intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment. No impairment losses have been recognized in the periods presented. 
DEPOSITS

Total deposits were $41.7 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $113.7 million, or 0.3%, compared to December 31, 2023. The increase was due to an increase in customer deposits with the largest change being in the commercial customer balances, reflective of our Business Bank of Choice strategy, partially offset by a decrease in brokered deposits. The interest-bearing deposit mix increased mainly due to a migration from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing accounts as customers seek higher rates in the current interest rate environment.

The Company's total core deposits, which are deposits less time deposits greater than $250,000 and all brokered deposits, were $37.5 billion as of December 31, 2024, compared to $37.4 billion as of December 31, 2023. The Company's total brokered deposits were $3.0 billion or 7% of total deposits as of December 31, 2024, compared to $3.1 billion or 8% of total deposits as of December 31, 2023.
The FDIC generally provides a standard amount of insurance of $250,000 per depositor for each account ownership category defined by the FDIC. Depositors may qualify for coverage of accounts over $250,000 if they have funds in different ownership categories and all FDIC requirements are met. All deposits that an account owner has in the same ownership category at the same bank are added together and insured up to the standard insurance amount. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $27.7 billion, or 66%, and $28.1 billion, or 68%, respectively, of the Bank’s deposits were estimated to be insured. Uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2024, totaled $14.0 billion, as compared to $13.5 billion as of December 31, 2023. Uninsured deposits are an estimated amount based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank's regulatory requirements. As of December 31, 2024, total available liquidity was $18.0 billion, or 128% of estimated uninsured deposits.
BORROWINGS

As of December 31, 2024, the Bank had outstanding securities sold under agreements to repurchase of $236.6 million, a decrease of $15.5 million from December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, the Bank had no outstanding federal funds purchased balances. The Bank had outstanding borrowings consisting of FHLB advances of $3.1 billion as of December 31, 2024. Total borrowings decreased $850.0 million since December 31, 2023, primarily due to repayment of borrowings as well as general liquidity management. The FHLB advances have fixed rates ranging from 4.48% to 5.25% and are set to mature in 2025. Advances from the FHLB are secured by investment securities and loans secured by real estate. The Bank's FRB BTFP borrowings were paid off during 2024 and the ability to take new advances under this program ended in March 2024.
JUNIOR AND OTHER SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES 

We had junior and other subordinated debentures with carrying values of $438.6 million and $424.3 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase is mainly due to an increase of $14.8 million in fair value for the junior subordinated debentures elected to be carried at fair value. The change in fair value was driven by increases in credit spreads and changes in swap rates during 2024. As of December 31, 2024, substantially all of the junior subordinated debentures had interest rates that are adjustable on a quarterly basis based on a spread over three-month term SOFR. The $10.0 million subordinated debenture matures in December 2025.

LIQUIDITY AND SOURCES OF FUNDS

The principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain the Bank's ability to meet the day-to-day cash flow requirements of our customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs. The Bank's liquidity strategy includes maintaining sufficient on-balance sheet liquidity to support balance sheet flexibility, fund growth in lending and investment portfolios, and deleverage non-deposit liabilities as economic conditions permit. As a result, the Company believes that it has sufficient cash and access to borrowings to effectively manage through the current economic conditions, as well as meet its working capital and other needs. The Company will continue to prudently evaluate and maintain liquidity sources, including the ability to fund future loan growth and manage our borrowing sources.
We monitor the sources and uses of funds daily to maintain an acceptable liquidity position. One source of funds includes public deposits. Individual state laws require banks to collateralize public deposits, typically as a percentage of their public deposit balance in excess of FDIC insurance. Public deposits represented 7% of total deposits at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The amount of collateral required varies by state and may also vary by institution within each state, depending on the individual state's risk assessment of depository institutions. Changes in the pledging requirements for uninsured public deposits may require pledging additional collateral to secure these deposits, drawing on other sources of funds to finance the purchase of assets that would be available to be pledged to satisfy a pledging requirement, or could lead to the withdrawal of certain public deposits from the Bank. 
The Banks’s diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, while reducing the Bank’s reliance on the wholesale markets. Total core deposits were $37.5 billion as of December 31, 2024, compared with $37.4 billion as of December 31, 2023. The Bank also has liquidity from excess bond collateral of $3.1 billion.
In addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities, the Bank can sell securities under agreements to repurchase, issue brokered certificates of deposit, or utilize off-balance sheet funding sources.
The Bank maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of off-balance sheet funding sources. These liquidity sources include capacity to borrow from uncommitted lines of credit, advances from the FHLB, and the Federal Reserve Bank’s Discount Window. Availability of the uncommitted lines of credit is subject to federal funds balances available for loan and continued borrower eligibility. These lines are intended to support short-term liquidity needs, and the agreements may restrict consecutive day usage.

The Company is a separate entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. Substantially all of the Company's revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the Bank. There were $360.0 million of dividends paid by the Bank to the Company in 2024. There are statutory and regulatory provisions that limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Company. FDIC and Oregon Division of Financial Regulation approval is required for quarterly dividends from the Bank to the Company.

Although we expect the Bank's and the Company's liquidity positions to remain satisfactory during 2025, it is possible that our deposit balances may not be maintained at previous levels due to pricing pressure or customers' behavior in the current economic environment. In addition, in order to generate deposit growth, our pricing may need to be adjusted in a manner that results in increased interest expense on deposits. We may utilize borrowings or other funding sources, which are generally more costly than deposit funding, to support our liquidity levels.
Commitments and Other Contractual Obligation
s - The Company participates in many different contractual arrangements which may or may not be recorded on its balance sheet, under which the Company has an obligation to pay certain amounts, provide credit or liquidity enhancements, or provide market risk support. Our material contractual obligations are primarily for time deposits, borrowings, and subordinated debentures. As of December 31, 2024, time deposits totaled $6.1 billion, of which $6.0 billion matures in a year or less. Total FHLB advances as of December 31, 2024 were $3.1 billion, all of which mature within one year. The Company also has a $10.0 million subordinated debenture that matures within one year. These arrangements also include off-balance sheet commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and various forms of guarantees. As of December 31, 2024, our loan commitments were $10.1 billion and letter of credit commitments were $216.4 million. A portion of the commitments will eventually result in funded loans and increase our profitability through net interest income when drawn and unused commitment fees prior to being drawn. Refer to Note 16 – 
Commitments and Contingencies and Related-Party Transactions 
in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information. Financing commitments, letters of credit and deferred purchase commitments are presented at contractual amounts and do not necessarily reflect future cash outflows as many are expected to expire unused or partially used.

CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2024 was $5.1 billion, an increase of $123.2 million from December 31, 2023. The fluctuation in shareholders' equity during the year ended December 31, 2024 was principally due to net income of $533.7 million, partially offset by cash dividends paid of $303.4 million during the period and other comprehensive loss of $121.8 million.

The Federal Reserve Board has guidelines in place for risk-based capital requirements applicable to U.S. banks and bank/financial holding companies. These risk-based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors, as defined by regulation, associated with various categories of assets, both on and off-balance sheet. Refer to the discussion of the capital adequacy requirements in 
Supervision and Regulatio
n in Item 1

of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Under the Basel III guidelines, capital strength is measured in three tiers, which are used in conjunction with risk-adjusted assets to determine the risk-based capital ratios. The guidelines require an 8% total risk-based capital ratio, of which 6% must be Tier 1 capital and 4.5% must be CET1. Our CET1 capital primarily includes shareholders' equity less certain deductions for goodwill and other intangibles, net of taxes, net unrealized gains (losses) on AFS securities, net of tax, net unrealized gains (losses) related to fair value of liabilities, net of tax, and certain deferred tax assets that arise from tax loss and credit carry-forwards, and totaled $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2024. Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of CET1 capital, less certain additional deductions applied during the phase-in period, and totaled $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2024. Tier 2 capital components include all, or a portion of, the ACL in excess of Tier 1 statutory limits and combined trust preferred security debt issuances. The total of Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital components is referred to as Total Risk-Based Capital and was $5.1 billion as of December 31, 2024. 
A minimum leverage ratio is required in addition to the risk-based capital standards and is defined as period-end shareholders' equity, less accumulated other comprehensive income, goodwill, and deposit-based intangibles, divided by average assets as adjusted for goodwill and other intangible assets. Although a minimum leverage ratio of 4% is required for the highest-rated financial holding companies that are not undertaking significant expansion programs, the Federal Reserve may require a financial holding company to maintain a leverage ratio greater than 4% if it is experiencing or anticipating significant growth or is operating with less than well-diversified risks in the opinion of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve uses the leverage and risk-based capital ratios to assess capital adequacy of banks and financial holding companies.

Basel III also requires all banking organizations to maintain a 2.50% capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital requirements to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions, stock repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital conservation buffer is exclusively comprised of CET1 capital, and it applies to each of the three risk-based capital ratios but not to the leverage ratio. The CET1, Tier 1, and total capital ratio minimums inclusive of the capital conservation buffer were 7.00%, 8.50%, and 10.50%, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, the Company and Bank were in compliance with the capital conservation buffer requirements.
As of December 31, 2024, the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as "well-capitalized" under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank's regulatory capital category.
Along with enactment of the CARES Act, the federal bank regulatory authorities issued an interim final rule to provide banking organizations that are required to implement CECL before the end of 2020 the option to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital by up to two years, with a three-year transition period to phase out the cumulative benefit to regulatory capital provided during the two-year delay. The Company elected this capital relief and delayed the estimated regulatory capital impact of adopting CECL, relative to the incurred loss methodology's effect on regulatory capital.
As of December 31, 2024, all four of the capital ratios of the Bank exceeded the minimum ratios required by federal regulation. Management monitors these ratios on a regular basis to ensure that the Bank remains within regulatory guidelines. 
The Company's dividend policy considers, among other things, earnings, regulatory capital levels, the overall payout ratio and expected asset growth to determine the amount of dividends declared, if any, on a quarterly basis. There is no assurance that future cash dividends on common shares will be declared or increased. We cannot predict the extent of the economic decline that could result in inadequate earnings, regulatory restrictions and limitations, changes to our capital requirements, or a decision to increase capital by retention of earnings, that may result in the inability to pay dividends at previous levels, or at all.
During 2024, Columbia declared a cash dividend of $0.36 per common share for all four quarters. These dividends were made pursuant to our existing dividend policy and in consideration of, among other things, earnings, regulatory capital levels, the overall payout ratio, and expected asset growth. 
The payment of future cash dividends is at the discretion of our Board and subject to a number of factors, including results of operations, general business conditions, growth, financial condition, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. Further, our ability to pay future cash dividends is subject to certain regulatory requirements and restrictions discussed in the 
Supervision and Regulation 
section in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
The following table presents cash dividends declared and dividend payout ratios (dividends declared per common share divided by basic earnings per common share) for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022:

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Market risk management is an integral part of our risk culture. Our Financial Risk Management group (FRM) is the risk management function that partners with business units to identify, measure, and manage market risks throughout the Company. FRM ensures transparency of significant market risks, helps set risk limits that are consistent with the risk appetite approved by the Board, monitors compliance with risk limits, and escalates limit exceptions to appropriate executive management and the Board. The various business units are responsible for implementing effective internal controls and maintaining appropriate processes for identifying, assessing, controlling, and mitigating the market risk arising from their activities consistent with the Company’s established risk appetite and risk limits. Market risk is monitored through various measures, such as simulations, routine stress testing, sensitivity analysis, and scenario analysis.
Market risk is the risk arising from adverse changes in market factors, including interest rates, credit spreads, and volatilities on the income and the value of our portfolios. These market factors influence prospective yields, values, or prices of the assets and liabilities of the company. Our market risk arises primarily from the interest rate risk inherent in our investment, lending, and financing activities.
Interest rate risk is the risk to the company’s current or projected financial condition arising from adverse changes in interest rates. The absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant impact on the earnings and economic value of the company. The objective of interest rate risk management is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest income and economic value to changing interest rates to achieve our overall financial objectives. Interest rate risk exposure is managed primarily through a set of limits that are established considering strategic goals, risk appetite, and market conditions. We manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through actions that are established by the ALCO. The ALCO meets monthly and has responsibility for developing asset/liability management policy, formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings, and reviewing interest rate sensitivity. The Company's Board provides oversight of the asset/liability management process, reviews the results of the interest rate risk analyses prepared for the ALCO, and approves the asset/liability policy on an annual basis.
We measure our interest rate risk position monthly. The primary tools we use to measure our interest rate risk are net interest income simulation analyses and EVE (fair value of financial instruments) modeling. The results of these analyses are reviewed by the ALCO on a monthly basis. If hypothetical changes in interest rates cause changes to our simulated net interest income simulation or EVE modeling outside of our pre-established internal limits, we may adjust the asset and liability size or mix in an effort to bring our interest rate risk exposure within our established limits.
Net Interest Income Simulation
Interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. These repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement, repricing, or maturity during the life of the instruments. Interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during periods of changes in market interest rates.
An interest rate simulation model is used to estimate the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates. This model has inherent limitations, and these results are predicated on assumptions for interest rates, loan and investment pricing, loan and investment prepayments, deposit decay, and deposit rate movements. Our primary analysis assumes a static balance sheet, both in terms of the total size and mix of our balance sheet, meaning cash flows from the maturity or repricing of assets and liabilities are redeployed in the same instrument at modeled rates. We employ estimates based upon assumptions for each scenario, new volume rates for new balances, the rate of prepayments, and the correlation of pricing to changes in the interest rate environment. For example, for interest-bearing deposit balances, we utilize a repricing "beta" assumption, which is an estimate for the change in interest-bearing deposit costs given a change in the short-term market interest rates. Market risk models, including their key estimates and assumptions, are independently validated by the Company's Model Risk Management department.
Our simulation beta estimates applied to interest-bearing deposits in the rising rate and declining rate scenarios are 55% and 54%, respectively, for December 31, 2024, and are generally consistent with cumulative betas experienced in recent rate cycles.

Loan, time deposit, and term debt repricing characteristics are a significant component of interest rate sensitivity. Variable and adjustable-rate loans may or may not contain a rate floor, which impacts the sensitivity of the instrument based on repricing timing and the magnitude of the change in interest rate. The following tables show certain pricing characteristics including rate type, maturity, and floor detail of the loan portfolio, as well as maturity profile of term funding as of December 31, 2024:

 Commercial tranche loans that mature in one month are included in the floating rate loan category, not the fixed rate loan category, as these loans reprice in a manner similar to floating rate loans.
(2)
 Floating rate loans are indexed to prime and 1-month underlying interest rates. When adjustable rate loans reprice, they are indexed to interest rates that span 1-month tenors to 10-year tenors, as well as the prime rate; the most prevalent underlying index rates are 6-month tenors and 5-year tenors.

 Loans were grouped into three buckets: (1) No Floor: no contractual floor on the loan; (2) At Floor: current rate = floor; (3) Above Floor: current rate exceeds floor. The amount above the floor was based on the current margin plus the current index assuming the loan repriced on December 31, 2024. The adjustable loans may not reprice until well into the future, depending on the timing and size of interest rate changes.
Changes that could vary significantly from our assumptions include loan and deposit growth or contraction, changes in the mix of our earning assets or funding sources, and future asset/liability management decisions, all of which may have significant effects on our net interest income. Also, some of the assumptions made in the simulation model may not materialize and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur. In addition, the simulation model does not take into account actions management could undertake to mitigate negative impacts. Actions we could undertake include, but are not limited to, growing or contracting the balance sheet, changing the composition of the balance sheet, or changing our pricing strategies for loans or deposits.

The estimated impact on our net interest income over a time horizon of one year as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 are indicated in the table below. For the scenarios shown, the interest rate simulation assumes a parallel and sustained shift in market interest rates ratably over a twelve-month period with no change in the composition or size of the balance sheet. For example, the "up 200 basis points" scenario is based on a theoretical increase in market rates of 16.7 basis points per month for twelve months applied to the balance sheet as of December 31 for each respective year.

Our interest rate risk sensitivity at December 31, 2024 is minimal. Our current and 2023 projections indicate that in rising and falling interest rate environments the Company's net interest income would decrease or increase by a very modest amount. In 2022, we were "asset-sensitive" meaning we expected our net interest income to increase as market rates increased and to decrease as market rates decreased. The change in sensitivity as of December 31, 2024, from the prior year was due to the impact of decreasing interest rates resulting from Federal Reserve monetary policy and changes in funding and asset mixes. 
Interest rate sensitivity in the first year of the net interest income simulation for increasing interest rate scenarios is negatively impacted by non-maturity deposits repricing immediately while interest-earning assets (primarily the loan and leases held for investment portfolio) reprice at a slower rate based upon the instrument repricing characteristics. As a result, interest rate sensitivity in increasing interest rates scenarios improves in subsequent years as these assets reprice. Conversely, in a declining interest scenario, after year 1, net interest income is negatively impacted by assets repricing lower. Deposit products reprice lower, but certain low interest rate products remain at or hit their floors during the forecast horizon.
Management also prepares and reviews the long-term trends of the net interest income simulation to measure and monitor risk. This analysis assumes the same rate shift over the first year of the scenario as described above and holding steady thereafter. The estimated impact on our net interest income over the first and second-year time horizons as it relates to our balance sheet as of December 31, 2024, is indicated in the table below.

Economic Value of Equity
Another interest rate sensitivity measure we utilize is the quantification of economic value changes for all financial assets and liabilities, given an increase or decrease in market interest rates. This approach provides a longer-term view of interest rate risk, capturing all future expected cash flows. EVE measures the extent to which the economic value of assets, liabilities and derivative instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. Importantly, EVE values only the current balance sheet, excluding the growth assumptions used in net interest income sensitivity analyses. Additionally, the results are highly dependent on assumptions for products with embedded prepay optionality and indeterminate maturities. The uncertainty surrounding important assumptions used in EVE analysis may limit its efficacy. Assets and liabilities with option characteristics are measured based on different interest rate path valuations using statistical rate simulation techniques. The projections are by their nature forward-looking and therefore inherently uncertain and include various assumptions regarding cash flows and discount rates.

As of December 31, 2024, our EVE analysis indicates a liability sensitive profile. This suggests a sudden or sustained increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in our estimated EVE, as the decrease in the economic value of our interest-earning assets exceeds the increase in economic value of interest-bearing liabilities. In declining interest rate scenarios, our EVE increases. This occurs as the increase in economic value of interest-earning assets exceeds the decline in economic value of interest-bearing liabilities, including the core deposit intangible. Our overall sensitivity to changes in market interest rates shifted from the prior year, primarily due to the relative level of market interest rates and changes in asset and funding mix during the year. As of December 31, 2024, our estimated EVE (fair value of financial assets and liabilities) was above our book value of equity primarily due to an increase in the economic value of the core deposit intangible.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Columbia Banking System, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Columbia Banking System, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). 
We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Because management's assessment and our audit were conducted to meet the reporting requirements of Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA), management's assessment and our audit of the Company's internal control over financial reporting included controls over the preparation of the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements in accordance with the instructions for the Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (Form FR Y-9C).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans and Leases— Refer to Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The estimate of current expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. To calculate the ACLLL, management uses models to estimate the PD and LGD, utilizing inputs that include forecasted future economic conditions and specific macroeconomic variables relevant to each of the Bank’s loan and lease portfolios. The Bank has selected models at the portfolio level using a risk-based approach, with larger, more complex portfolios having more complex models. Loans and leases that have not been included in the models based on portfolio type are assigned a loss rate through an extrapolation methodology. This methodology applies to certain loans acquired through mergers, newly originated loans and leases, and those lacking the detailed data required for the models. 
Historical loss experience is the starting point for estimating expected credit losses. Adjustments are made to historical loss experience to reflect differences in asset-specific risk characteristics, such as underwriting standards, portfolio mix or asset terms, and differences in economic conditions – both current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. When the Company is not able to make or obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts for the entire life of the financial asset, it has estimated expected credit losses for the remaining life using an approach that reverts to historical credit loss information for the longer-term portion of the asset's life.
In calculating the ACLLL, the Bank considered the financial and economic environment at the time of assessment and economic scenarios that differed in the levels of severity and sensitivity to the ACLLL results. At each measurement date, the Bank selects the scenario that reflects its view of future economic conditions and is determined to be the most probable outcome. All forecasts are updated for each variable where applicable and incorporated as relevant into the ACLLL calculation. 
Along with the quantitative factors, qualitative factors are also considered in determining the ACLLL. Qualitative factors are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses but are not fully captured within the expected credit loss models. 
Given the size of the ACLLL, the complexity of the models, and the management judgments required for the selection of appropriate models, forecasting economic conditions, and determining qualitative adjustments, performing audit procedures to evaluate the ACLLL requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our credit specialists.

We have identified the ACLLL estimate for certain loan portfolios as a critical audit matter based upon the above factors, which includes the economic forecast selection, model applicability, and assessment of qualitative adjustments. 
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the ACLLL included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over the (i) selection of the economic forecasts, (ii) development, execution, and monitoring of the models and extrapolation methodology, (iii) data and data transfers, (iv) determination of the qualitative allowance, and (v) overall calculation and disclosure of the ACL.
•
With the assistance of credit specialists, we (i) evaluated the reasonableness of the models, extrapolation methodology, and related assumptions and (ii) assessed the reasonableness of design, theory, and logic of the models for estimating expected credit losses.
•
We tested the completeness and accuracy of key data elements used in the models and extrapolation methodology.
•
We (i) evaluated the appropriateness and relevance of the qualitative factors and (ii) tested the arithmetic accuracy of the calculation of the qualitative allowance.
•
We evaluated the reasonableness of the economic scenario utilized by management in the model by comparing it to the Company’s business environment and other third-party forecasts.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 – 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
Nature of Operations
-
Columbia Banking System, Inc. is headquartered in Tacoma, Washington, and is engaged primarily in the business of commercial and consumer banking. The Company provides a broad range of banking and other financial services to corporate, institutional, small business, and individual customers through its wholly-owned banking subsidiary Umpqua Bank. The Bank has a wholly-owned subsidiary, Financial Pacific Leasing, Inc., which is a commercial equipment leasing company.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation by certain federal and state agencies and undergo periodic examination by these regulatory agencies.
Basis of Financial Statement Presentation
-
On
 February 28, 2023
, UHC merged with and into Columbia, with Columbia continuing as the surviving legal corporation. Promptly following the Merger, Columbia’s wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Columbia State Bank, merged with and into UHC’s wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Umpqua Bank, with Umpqua Bank as the surviving bank. Upon completion of the Merger, the combined company became Columbia Banking System, Inc. (together with its direct and indirect subsidiaries, "we," "us," "our," "Columbia" or the "Company"), which is a financial holding company with its wholly-owned banking subsidiary Umpqua Bank (the "Bank").
The Merger was accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting; therefore, UHC was deemed the acquirer for financial reporting purposes, even though Columbia was the legal acquirer. The Merger was effectively an all-stock transaction and was accounted for as a business combination. Columbia's financial results for any periods ended prior to February 28, 2023, the Merger Date, reflect UHC results only on a standalone basis. Accordingly, Columbia's reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2023 reflect only UHC financial results through the closing of the Merger and may not be directly comparable to the prior or future reported periods. The number of shares issued and outstanding, earnings per share, additional paid-in capital, and all references to share quantities or metrics of Columbia have been retrospectively restated to reflect the equivalent number of shares issued in the Merger as the Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the reverse acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Columbia were recorded at their respective fair values as of February 28, 2023 ("historical Columbia"). Refer to Note 2 – 
Business Combination
 for additional information on this acquisition. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and with prevailing practices within the banking and securities industries. In preparing such financial statements, management is required to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of the ACL and goodwill.
Consolidation
-
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and the Bank's wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company has wholly-owned trusts that were formed to issue trust preferred securities and related common securities of the Trusts. The Company has not consolidated the accounts of the Trusts in its consolidated financial statements as they are considered to be variable interest entities for which the Company is not a primary beneficiary. As a result, the junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company to the Trusts are reflected on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as junior subordinated debentures.
Subsequent events
-
The Company has evaluated events and transactions through the date that the consolidated financial statements were issued for potential recognition or disclosure.
79
Table of 
Conte
n
t
s
Business Combinations
-The Company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Under the acquisition method, the acquiring entity recognizes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. Management utilizes prevailing valuation techniques appropriate for the asset or liability being measured in determining these fair values. This method often involves estimates based on third-party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, all of which are inherently subjective. Any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets and other identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed from contingencies must also be recognized at fair value if the fair value can be determined during the measurement period. Acquisition‑related costs, including conversion and restructuring charges, are expensed as incurred. Fair values are subject to refinement over the measurement period, not to exceed one year after the closing date.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
-
Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks and temporary investments which are interest-bearing balances due from other banks. Cash and cash equivalents generally have a maturity of 
90
 days or less at the time of purchase.
Equity and Other Securities
-
Equity and other securities are carried at fair value with realized and unrealized gains or losses recorded in non-interest income.

Investment Securities Available for Sale-
Debt securities are classified as available for sale if the Company intends and has the ability to hold those securities for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Any decision to sell a debt security classified as available for sale would be based on various factors, including significant movements in interest rates, changes in the maturity mix of assets and liabilities, liquidity needs, regulatory capital considerations, and other similar factors. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related investment security as an adjustment to yield using the effective interest method. Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned. 
Securities available for sale are carried at fair value. Realized gains or losses, determined on the basis of the cost of specific securities sold, are included in earnings. Unrealized holding gains or losses are included in other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders' equity, net of tax. When the fair value of an available-for-sale debt security falls below the amortized cost basis, it is evaluated to determine if any of the decline in value is attributable to credit loss. Decreases in fair value attributable to credit loss would be recorded directly to earnings with a corresponding ACL, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. If the credit quality subsequently improves, the allowance would be reversed up to a maximum of the previously recorded credit losses. If the Company intends to sell an impaired available-for-sale debt security, or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security prior to recovering the amortized cost basis, the entire fair value adjustment would be immediately recognized in earnings with no corresponding ACL.
Loans Held for Sale
-
Loans held for sale represent residential mortgage loans intended to be sold in the secondary market and non-mortgage loans that management has an active plan to sell. The Company has elected to account for residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value and non-mortgage loans at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair value is determined based on quoted secondary market prices for similar loans, including the implicit fair value of embedded servicing rights. The change in fair value of loans held for sale is primarily driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding, resulting in revaluation adjustments to the recorded fair value. The inputs used in the fair value measurements are considered Level 2 inputs. The use of the fair value option allows the change in the fair value of loans to more effectively offset the change in the fair value of derivative instruments that are used as economic hedges to loans held for sale. Loan origination fees and direct origination costs are recognized immediately in net income. Interest income on loans held for sale is included in interest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income and recognized when earned. Loans held for sale are placed on non-accrual in a manner consistent with loans held for investment. The Company recognizes the gain or loss on the sale of loans when the sales criteria for derecognition are met.
Loans and Leases
-Loans are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, net of unearned income and any deferred fees or costs. All discounts and premiums are recognized over the contractual life of the loan as yield adjustments. Origination and commitment fees and direct loan origination costs for loans and leases held for investment are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the yield over the life of the loans and leases. The recognition of these net deferred fees is accelerated at loan payoff, if earlier than the life of the loan.
Leases are recorded at the amount of minimum future lease payments receivable and estimated residual value of the leased equipment, net of unearned income and any deferred fees. Initial direct costs related to lease originations are deferred as part of the investment in direct financing leases and amortized over their term using the effective interest method. Unearned lease income is amortized over the lease term using the effective interest method.

Loans and leases purchased or acquired through business combinations without more-than-insignificant credit deterioration are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date. However, loans and leases purchased with more-than-insignificant credit deterioration will be recorded with their applicable ACL to determine the amortized cost basis. The difference between the fair value and principal balance is recognized as an adjustment to the yield over the remaining life of the loan and lease. The Company periodically sells loans through either securitizations or individual loans sales from its portfolio to maintain a balanced and healthy loan portfolio, enhance liquidity, and manage credit risk.
Non-Accrual and Past Due Loans and Leases
-
Loans and leases are considered past due when the contractual amounts due with respect to principal and interest are not received within 
30
 days of the contractual due date. Loans are classified as non-accrual if the collection of principal and interest is doubtful. Generally, this occurs when a loan is past due beyond its maturity, principal payment, or interest payment due date by 
90
 days or more, unless such loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans that are less than 
90
 days past due may also be classified as non-accrual if repayment in full of principal and/or interest is in doubt.
Generally, when a loan is classified as non-accrual, all uncollected accrued interest is reversed from interest income and the accrual of interest income is discontinued. In addition, any cash payments subsequently received are applied as a reduction of principal outstanding. In cases where the future collectability of the principal balance in full is expected, interest income may be recognized on a cash basis. A loan may be restored to accrual status when the borrower's financial condition improves so that full collection of future contractual payments is considered likely. For those loans placed on non-accrual status due to payment delinquency, return to accrual status will typically not occur until the borrower demonstrates repayment ability over a period of not less than six months.
Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty
-
A debtor is considered to be experiencing financial difficulty when there is significant doubt about the debtor’s ability to make required payments on the debt or to get equivalent financing from another creditor at a market rate for similar debt. The Company may modify the contractual terms of loans and leases to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties as a way to mitigate loss, proactively work with borrowers in financial difficulty, or to comply with regulations regarding the treatment of certain bankruptcy filing and discharge situations.
Modifications to borrowers in financial difficulty may include term extensions, interest rate reductions, principal or interest forgiveness, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, or any combination of these. The Company closely monitors the performance of loans and leases that are modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to understand the effectiveness of its modification efforts. Loans and leases are considered to be in payment default at 
90
 days or more days past due. Loans and leases with modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are subject to policies governing accrual/non-accrual evaluation consistent with all other loans of the same product types. As such, modifications to troubled borrowers may include loans remaining on non-accrual, moving to non-accrual, or continuing on accrual status, depending on the individual facts and circumstances.
Allowance for Credit Losses
-
ASC Topic 326 requires an expected loss model, which encompasses allowances for credit losses expected to be incurred over the contractual life of loans measured at amortized cost, including unfunded commitments. The estimate of current expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. To calculate the ACL, management uses models to estimate the PD and LGD for loans, utilizing inputs that include forecasted future economic conditions and specific macroeconomic variables relevant to each of the Bank’s loan and lease portfolios. Moody's Analytics, a third party, supplies the historical and forward-looking macroeconomic data utilized in the models used to calculate the ACL.
The Company utilizes complex models to obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts. Most of the models calculate two predictive metrics: the PD and LGD. The PD measures the probability that a loan will default within a given time horizon and primarily measures the adequacy of the debtor's cash flow as the primary source of repayment of the loan or lease. The LGD is the expected loss which would be realized presuming a default has occurred and primarily measures the value of the collateral or other secondary sources of repayment related to the collateral. Acquired and newly originated loans and leases that have not been modeled receive a loss rate via an extrapolated rate methodology.
81

Historical loss experience is the starting point for estimating expected credit losses. Adjustments are made to historical loss experience to reflect differences in asset-specific risk characteristics, such as underwriting standards, portfolio mix or asset terms, and differences in economic conditions – both current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. When the Company is not able to make or obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts for the entire life of the financial asset, it has estimated expected credit losses for the remaining life using an approach that reverts to historical credit loss information for the longer-term portion of the asset's life. The allowance related to the extrapolated population is based on loan segment, PD credit classification, and vintage year of the modeled loans and leases. A loss factor is calculated and applied to the non-modeled loans and leases.
In calculating the ACL, the Bank considered the financial and economic environment at the time of assessment and economic scenarios that differed in the levels of severity and sensitivity to the ACL results. At each measurement date, the Bank selects the scenario that reflects its view of future economic conditions and is determined to be the most probable outcome.

All forecasts are updated for each variable where applicable and incorporated as relevant into the ACL calculation. Actual credit loss results and the timing thereof will differ from the estimate of credit losses, either in a strong economy or a recession, as the portfolio will change through time due to growth, risk mitigation actions and other factors. In addition, the scenarios used will differ and change through time as economic conditions change. Economic scenarios might not capture deterioration or improvement in the economy timely enough for the Bank to be able to adequately address the impact to the ACL.
The ACL is measured on a collective (pool) basis when similar characteristics exist. The Company has selected models at the portfolio level using a risk-based approach, with larger, more complex portfolios having more complex models. Except as noted below, the macroeconomic variables that are inputs to the models are reasonable and supportable over the life of the loans in that they reasonably project the key economic variables in the near term and then converge to a long-run equilibrium trend. These models produce reasonable and supportable estimates of loss over the life of the loans as the projected credit losses will also converge to a steady state in line with the variables applied.
The following provides credit quality indicators and risk elements most relevant in monitoring and measuring the ACL on loans for each of the loan portfolio segments identified:
•
Commercial Real Estate:
 Non-owner occupied commercial real estate, multifamily, and commercial construction loans are analyzed using a model that uses four primary property variables: net operating income, property value, property type, and location. For PD estimation, the model simulates potential future paths of net operating income given commercial real estate market factors determined from macroeconomic and regional commercial real estate forecasts. Using the resulting expected debt service coverage ratios, together with predicted loan-to-values and other variables, the model estimates PD from the range of conditional possibilities. In addition, the model estimates maturity PD capturing refinance default risk to produce a total PD for the loan. The model estimates LGD, inclusive of principal loss and liquidation expenses, empirically using predicted loan-to-value as well as certain market and other factors. The LGD calculation also includes a separate maturity risk component. The primary economic drivers in the model are GDP growth, U.S. unemployment rate, and 10-Year Treasury yield. These economic drivers are translated into a forecast, provided by Moody's Analytics' REIS, of real estate metrics, such as rental rates, vacancies, and cap rates. The model produces PD and LGD on a quarter-by-quarter basis for the life of loan.
The owner-occupied commercial real estate portfolio utilizes a top-down macroeconomic model using logistic regression. This model produces portfolio level quarterly net charge-off rates according to the macroeconomic scenario over a reasonable and supportable two-year forecast. The primary economic drivers for this model are commercial real estate price index and a five-state average unemployment rate. The model utilizes output reversion methodology, which after two years reverts on a straight-line basis over one year to the long run historical average net charge-off rate.
•
Commercial:
 Non-homogeneous commercial loans and leases and residential development loans are analyzed in a multi-step process. An initial PD is estimated using a model driven by an obligor's selected financial statement ratios, together with cycle-adjusting information based on the obligor's state and industry. An initial LGD is derived separately based on collateral type using collateral value and a haircut to reflect the loss in liquidation. Another model then applies an auto-regression technique to the initial PD and LGD metrics to estimate the PD and LGD curves according to the macroeconomic scenario. The primary economic drivers in the model are GDP growth and commercial real estate price index.
82
Table of 
Conte

t
s
The model for the homogeneous lease and equipment finance agreement portfolio uses lease and equipment finance agreement information, such as origination and performance, as well as macroeconomic variables to calculate PD and LGD values. The PD calculation is based on survival analysis while LGD is calculated using a two-step regression. The model calculates LGD using an estimate of the probability that a defaulted lease or equipment finance agreement will have a loss, and an estimate of the loss amount. The primary economic drivers for the model are U.S. unemployment rate, the 5-year treasury rate, value of construction put in place, consumer price index, and a home price growth index. The model produces PD and LGD curves at the lease or equipment finance agreement level for each month in the forecast horizon.
•
Residential:
 The models for residential real estate and HELOCs utilize loan level variables, such as origination and performance, as well as macroeconomic variables to calculate PD and LGD. The U.S. unemployment rate and home price growth rate indexes are primary economic drivers in both the residential real estate and HELOC models. In addition, the prime rate is also a primary driver in the HELOC model. The models

focus on establishing an empirical relationship between default probabilities and a set of loan-level, borrower, and macroeconomic credit risk drivers. The LGD calculation for residential real estate is based on an estimate of the probability that a defaulted loan will have a loss, and then an estimate of the loss amount. HELOCs utilize the same model using residential real estate LGD values to assign loans to cohorts based on FICO scores and loan age. The model produces PD and LGD curves at the loan level for each quarter in the forecast horizon.
•
Consumer:
 Historical net charge-off information as well as economic assumptions are used to project loss rates for the Consumer segment.
Loans and leases that have not been included in the models based on portfolio type are assigned a loss rate through an extrapolation methodology. This methodology applies to certain loans acquired through mergers, newly originated loans and leases, and those lacking the detailed data required for the primary models. The extrapolation methodology involves calculating loss rates through the modeling process. These loss rates are determined based on the vintage year, credit classification, and reporting category of the loans and leases. The calculated loss factors are then applied to the excluded loans and leases and evaluated qualitatively to ensure reasonability and compliance with CECL.
Along with the quantitative factors, qualitative factors are also considered in determining the ACL. Qualitative factors are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses but are not fully captured within the expected credit loss models. These factors may include adjustments for changes in policies, procedures, personnel, and unforeseen events affecting key inputs and assumptions within the Bank’s expected credit loss models. 
Loss factors from the models, prepayment speeds, and qualitative factors are input into the Company's CECL accounting application, which aggregates the information. The Company then uses two methods to calculate the current expected credit loss: 1) the DCF method, which is used for all loans except lines of credit and 2) the non-DCF method, which is used for lines of credit due to the difficulty of calculating an effective interest rate when lines have yet to be drawn on. The DCF method utilizes the effective interest rate of individual assets to discount the expected credit losses adjusted for prepayments. The difference in the net present value and the amortized cost of the asset will result in the required allowance. The non-DCF method uses the exposure at default, along with the expected credit losses adjusted for prepayments to calculate the required allowance.
Typically, loans in a non-accrual status will not have an ACL as they will be written down to their net realizable value or charged-off. However, the net realizable value for homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements is determined by the LGD calculated by the CECL model and therefore leases and equipment finance agreements on non-accrual will have an ACL until they become 181 days past due, at which time they are charged-off. The Bank has elected to exclude accrued interest receivable from the measurement of its ACL given the well-defined non-accrual policies which results in timely reversal of outstanding interest through interest income. 
Fluctuations in the allowance are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of provision for credit losses. Loans are charged-off against the allowance when deemed uncollectible by management. Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off.

The Bank has established an Allowance for Credit Losses Committee, which is responsible for, among other things, regularly reviewing the ACL methodology, including allowance levels, and ensuring that it is designed and applied in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. There is, however, no assurance that future loan losses will not exceed the levels provided for in the ACL and could possibly result in additional charges to the provision for credit losses.
Collateral-Dependent Loan
-
A loan or lease is considered collateral dependent when repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. The Company's classification of CDLs includes: non-homogeneous non-accrual loans and leases; non-homogeneous loans and leases determined by individual credit review; homogeneous non-accrual leases and equipment finance agreements; and homogeneous real estate secured loans that have been charged down to net realizable value or the government guaranteed balance. Except for homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements, the expected credit losses for CDLs will be measured using the fair value of the underlying collateral, adjusted for costs to sell when applicable, less the amortized cost basis of the financial asset. The Company may also use the loan's observable market price, if available. If the value of the CDL is determined to be less than the recorded amount of the loan, a charge-off will be taken. To determine the expected credit loss for homogeneous leases or equipment finance agreements, the LGD calculated by the CECL model will be utilized. When a homogeneous lease or equipment finance agreement becomes 181 days past due, it is fully charged-off.

Reserve for Unfunded Commitments
-
A RUC is maintained at a level that, in the opinion of management, is adequate to absorb expected losses associated with the Bank's commitment to lend funds under existing agreements, such as letters or lines of credit. The RUC calculation utilizes the ACLLL rates by segment, and utilization rates based on the economic expectations over the contractual life of the commitment adjusted for qualitative considerations, if necessary. The reserve is based on estimates and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. These estimates are evaluated on a regular basis and adjustments are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known. Draws on unfunded commitments that are considered uncollectible at the time funds are advanced are charged to the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases. Provisions for unfunded commitment losses are added to the RUC, which is included in the other liabilities section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Restricted Equity Securities
-
Restricted equity securities consists mostly of the Bank's investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines stock that is carried at par value, which reasonably approximates its fair value. As a member of the FHLB system, the Bank is required to maintain a minimum level of investment in FHLB stock based on a specific percentage of total assets, with additional stock requirements based on use of FHLB products. The Bank may request redemption at par value of any stock in excess of the minimum required investment. Stock redemptions are at the discretion of the FHLB.
Premises and Equipment
-
Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is allocated over the estimated useful life of equipment, generally 
three
 to 
ten years
, and premises, up to 
39
 years, on a straight-line or accelerated basis. Generally, leasehold improvements are amortized or accreted over the life of the related lease, or the life of the related asset, whichever is shorter. Expenditures for major renovations and betterments of the Company's premises and equipment are capitalized. The Company purchases, as well as internally develops and customizes, certain software to enhance or perform internal business functions. Software development costs incurred in the preliminary project stages are charged to non-interest expense. Costs associated with designing software configuration, installation, coding programs and testing systems are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over 
three
 to 
seven years
. Implementation costs incurred for software that is part of a hosting arrangement are capitalized in other assets and amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract. In addition to annual impairment reviews, management reviews long-lived assets anytime a change in circumstance indicates the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.
Operating Leases
-
The Company leases branch locations, corporate office space, and equipment under non-cancelable leases. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. The leases contain various provisions for increases in rental rates, based either on changes in the published Consumer Price Index or a predetermined escalation schedule. Substantially all of the leases provide the Company with one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from 
one
 to 
ten years
 or more. The exercise of lease renewal options is at management's sole discretion. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company rents or subleases certain real estate to third parties. The Company's sublease portfolio consists of operating leases of mainly former branch locations or excess space in branch or corporate facilities. In addition to annual impairment reviews, management reviews right of use assets anytime a change in circumstances indicates the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.

Operating Segments
-
Operating segments are components of a business for which separate financial information is available and regularly evaluated by the CODM to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company must report information about its operating segment in financial statements, including details about products and services, geographic activities, and major customers. The Company’s CODM manages and evaluates financial performance on a company-wide basis. As such, the Company has determined it has one reportable segment.
Goodwill and Other Intangibles
-
Intangible assets are comprised of goodwill and other intangibles acquired in business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized but instead is periodically tested for impairment. The Company performs a goodwill impairment analysis on an annual basis as of October 31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level either qualitatively or quantitatively. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. 
Intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their respective estimated useful lives, and also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Amortization of intangible assets is included in non-interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Mortgage Servicing Rights
-
The Company determines its classes of servicing assets based on the asset type being serviced along with the methods used to manage the risk inherent in the servicing assets, which includes the market inputs used to value servicing assets. Fair value adjustments encompass market-driven valuation changes and the runoff in value that occurs from the passage of time, which are separately disclosed. Under the fair value method, the MSR is carried in the balance sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value are reported in earnings under the caption residential mortgage banking revenue, net in the period in which the change occurs.
The expected life of the loans underlying the MSR can vary from management's estimates due to prepayments by borrowers, especially when rates change significantly. Prepayments outside of management's estimates would impact the recorded value of the residential MSR. The value of the MSR is also dependent upon the discount rate used in the model, which management reviews on an ongoing basis. An increase in the discount rate would reduce the value of the MSR.
Revenue Recognition
-
The Company's revenue within the contracts with customers guidance are presented within non-interest income and include service charges on deposits, card-based fees, merchant fee income, and financial services, brokerage revenue and trust revenue. These revenues are recognized when obligations under the terms of a contract with customers are satisfied. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. When the amount of consideration is variable, the Company will only recognize revenue to the extent that it is probable that the cumulative amount recognized will not be subject to a significant reversal in the future. Substantially all of the Company's contracts with customers have expected durations of one year or less and payments are typically due when or as the services are rendered or shortly thereafter. When third parties are involved in providing services to customers, the Company recognizes revenue on a gross basis when it has control over those services being provided to the customer; otherwise, revenue is recognized for the net amount of any fee or commission.
Revenue is segregated based on the nature of product and services offered as part of contractual arrangements. Revenue from contracts with customers is broadly segregated as follows:
•
Service charges on deposits
 consist primarily of fees earned from deposit customers for account maintenance and transaction-based and overdraft services. Account maintenance fees consist primarily of account fees and analyzed account fees charged on deposit accounts on a monthly basis. The performance obligation is satisfied, and the fees are recognized on a monthly basis as the service period is completed. Transaction-based fees on deposit accounts are charged to deposit customers for specific services provided to the customer, such as non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft fees, and wire fees. The performance obligation is completed as the transaction occurs and the fees are recognized at the time each specific service is provided to the customer. 
•
Card-based fees
 are comprised of debit and credit card income, ATM fees, and merchant services income. Debit and credit card income is primarily comprised of interchange fees earned when the Bank's customers' debit and credit cards are processed through card payment networks. The performance obligation is satisfied, and the fees are earned when the cost of the transaction is charged to the cardholders' debit or credit card. Certain expenses and rebates directly related to the credit and debit card interchange contract are recorded on a net basis with the interchange income. 
85
Table of 
Conte

t
s
•
Financial services and trust revenue
 consists of brokerage revenue related to third-party revenue share agreements for commissions on brokerage services and trust revenue from trust administration and investment management services. Brokerage revenue is recognized when cash payment is received by the third party based on the net revenues earned on the products and services purchased in the month prior. Trust revenue is recognized monthly and based on the portfolio values at the end of the prior month. 
•
Other non-interest income 
includes a variety of other revenue streams including residential mortgage banking, net revenue, security gains and losses, loan sales gain and losses, BOLI income revenue, swap revenue, treasury management, and miscellaneous consumer fees. These revenue streams are not in the scope of revenue from contracts with customers guidance. Revenue is recognized when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Inherent variability in the transaction price is not recognized until the uncertainty affecting the variability is resolved.

Income Taxes
-
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under this method, a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the enacted tax rates which will be in effect when the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities are expected to be reported in the Company's income tax returns. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established to reduce the net carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is determined to be more likely than not, that all or some portion of the potential deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management's judgment that realization is "more likely than not." Uncertain tax positions that meet the "more likely than not" recognition threshold are measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax position is measured at the amount of benefit that management believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of realization upon settlement. 
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the DTA will or will not be realized. The Company's ultimate realization of the DTA is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the nature and amount of historical and projected future taxable income, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and available tax planning strategies in making this assessment. The amount of deferred taxes recognized could be impacted by changes to any of these variables.
The Company earns Investment Tax Credits on certain equipment leases and uses the deferral method to account for these tax credits.

Under this method, the Investment Tax Credits are recognized as a reduction of depreciation expense over the life of the asset.
Derivatives
-
The Bank enters into forward delivery contracts to sell residential mortgage loans or mortgage-backed securities to broker/dealers at specific prices and dates in order to hedge the interest rate risk in its portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale and its residential mortgage loan commitments. The commitments to originate mortgage loans held for sale and the related forward delivery contracts are considered derivatives. The Bank also executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are hedged by simultaneously entering into an offsetting interest rate swap that the Bank executes with a third party, such that the Bank minimizes its net risk exposure. The Bank also uses certain derivative financial instruments to offset changes in the value of its MSR. These derivatives consist primarily of interest rate futures and forward settling mortgage-backed securities. The Company considers all free-standing derivatives as economic hedges and recognizes these derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, and the Company requires measurement of those instruments at fair value through adjustments to current earnings. None of the Company's derivatives are designated as hedging instruments.
The fair value of the derivative residential mortgage loan commitments is estimated using the net present value of expected future cash flows. Assumptions used include pull-through rate assumption based on historical information, current mortgage interest rates, the stage of completion of the underlying application and underwriting process, direct origination costs yet to be incurred, the time remaining until the expiration of the derivative loan commitment, and the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan.
Stock-Based Compensation
-
The Company recognizes expense in its statement of income for the grant-date fair value of RSUs and RSAs issued over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Estimated forfeitures are included in the calculation of stock-based compensation expense, with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur. 
86
Table of 
Conte
n
t
s
RSAs and RSUs issued by the Company generally vest ratably over 
three years
, with the related compensation expense recognized over this period. Certain performance-based awards are subject to performance-based and market-based vesting criteria, in addition to a requisite service period. These awards cliff vest based on the specified conditions at the end of 
three years
, with compensation expense recognized over the service period to the extent the RSUs are expected to vest. Recipients of RSAs have voting rights, while recipients of RSUs do not. Unvested RSUs and RSAs accrue dividends, which are paid out upon vesting and issuance of common shares. The fair value of time-based and performance-based RSAs and RSUs is equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The fair value of market-based performance RSUs is estimated on the grant date using the Monte Carlo simulation model.

Earnings per Common Share
-Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share is computed in a similar manner, except that first the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive common shares were issued using the treasury stock method. For all periods presented, unvested RSUs and RSAs are potentially dilutive instruments issued by the Company. Undistributed losses are not allocated to the unvested stock-based payment awards as the holders are not contractually obligated to share in the losses of the Company.
Fair Value Measurements
-Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There is a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value. The classification of assets and liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-derived or market-based information obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect estimates about market data. In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets that the Company has the ability to access. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls was determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability

ASU No. 2022-03, 
Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions
The amendments in this ASU clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. The amendments also update the disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual restrictions.
Fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2023.
The Company adopted the guidance on January 1, 2024, using a prospective methodology, and it did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
ASU No. 2023-02, 
Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)
The amendments in this ASU permit companies to elect to account for their tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received and recognizes the net amortization and income tax credits and other income tax benefits in the statement of income as a component of income tax expense (benefit). The amendments also require that a reporting entity disclose certain information in annual and interim reporting periods that enable investors to understand the investments that generate income tax credits and other income tax benefits from a tax credit program.
Fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2023.
The Company adopted the guidance on January 1, 2024, and it did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 25 – 
Income Taxes and Investment Tax Credits
 for additional information.
ASU No. 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280)
The amendments improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments enhance interim disclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and contain other disclosure requirements. The ASU requires that a public entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in this ASU and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280.
Fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024.
The Company adopted the guidance for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2024 for annual reporting. The amendments for interim periods will be adopted in our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2025. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 26 – 
Segment Reporting

ASU No. 2023-06,
 Disclosure Improvements
The amendments in this ASU modify the disclosure or presentation requirements of a variety of topics in the codification. The amendments align the requirements in the codification with the SEC’s regulations. 
Each amendment is effective on the date on which the SEC removes the related disclosure requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, as applicable. For all entities within the scope of the affected codification subtopics, if, by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed the applicable requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K, the pending content of the associated amendment will be removed from the codification and will not become effective for any entities.
The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
ASU No. 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
The amendments are intended to provide more transparency about income tax information through improvements to income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The ASU requires annual disclosure of the rate reconciliation of specific categories as well as additional information related to the reconciliation of certain items that meet a quantitative threshold and further disaggregation of income taxes paid.
Annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024.
The Company expects the adoption of the standard to result in additional disaggregation in the income tax footnote disclosures.
ASU No. 2024-03 
Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
These amendments are aimed to enhance the transparency and usefulness of financial information by requiring entities to break down significant expense categories in the notes to the financial statements. The amendments focus on the disaggregation of income statement expenses and specifically address the need for more detailed disclosures about expense categories. 
Fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Note 2 – 
Business Combination

On February 28, 2023
, the Company completed the Merger and UHC merged with and into Columbia, with Columbia continuing as the surviving legal corporation. Promptly following the Merger, Columbia’s wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Columbia State Bank, merged with and into UHC’s wholly-owned bank subsidiary, Umpqua Bank, with Umpqua Bank surviving the Merger. Refer to

Note 1 – 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 under the Basis of Financial Statement Presentation for more information pertaining to the completed Merger.

Table of

t
s
The Merger was accounted for as a reverse merger using the acquisition method of accounting; therefore, UHC was deemed the acquirer for financial reporting purposes, even though Columbia was the legal acquirer. The Merger was an all-stock transaction and has been accounted for as a business combination. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on the Merger Date, each holder of UHC common stock received 
0.5958
 of a share (the "Exchange Ratio") of Columbia's common stock for each share of UHC common stock held. Each outstanding share of common stock of Columbia remained outstanding and was unaffected by the Merger. As of the Merger Date and following the exchange of UHC common stock for Columbia common stock, Columbia had approximately 
208.2
 million shares of common stock outstanding. On the Merger Date, the shares of UHC common stock, which previously traded under the ticker symbol "UMPQ" on Nasdaq, ceased trading on, and were delisted from, Nasdaq. Following the Merger, Columbia common stock continues to trade on Nasdaq with the ticker symbol of "COLB".
As the legal acquirer, Columbia issued approximately 
129.4
 million shares of Columbia common stock in connection with the Merger, which represented approximately 
62.1
% of the voting interests in Columbia upon completion of the Merger. The purchase price in a reverse acquisition is determined based on the number of equity interests the legal acquiree would have had to issue to give the owners of the legal acquirer the same percentage equity interest in the combined entity that results from the reverse acquisition. Therefore, the first step in calculating the purchase price in the Merger is to determine the ownership of the combined company following the Merger. 
The table below summarizes the ownership of the combined company, Columbia, following the Merger, as well as the market capitalization of the combined company using shares of Columbia and UHC common stock outstanding at February 28, 2023 and Columbia’s closing price of $

The following table provides the purchase price allocation as of the Merger Date and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair value as of the Merger Date as recorded by the Company. The estimates of fair value were recorded based on initial valuations available at the Merger Date and further adjusted in the second quarter based on additional information. In many cases, the determination of fair value required management to make estimates about discount rates, expected future cash flows, market conditions and other future events that are highly subjective in nature. As of December 31, 2023, the Company finalized its valuation of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the Merger.

In connection with the Merger, the Company recorded approximately $

None of the goodwill recognized was deductible for tax purposes. Information regarding the allocation of goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition, as well as the carrying amounts and amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, are provided in Note 9 – 
Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset
s of the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
. 
The following is a description of the methods used to determine the fair values of significant assets and liabilities presented above.
Cash and due from banks
: The carrying amount of these assets is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the short-term nature of these assets.
Investment securities
: Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value estimates are based on observable inputs including quoted market prices for similar instruments, quoted market prices that are not in an active market or other inputs that are observable in the market. In the absence of observable inputs, fair value is estimated based on pricing models and/or discounted cash flow methodologies.
Loans held for sal
e: The loans held for sale portfolio was recorded at fair value based on quotes or bids from third-party investors.
91
Table of 
Conte
n
t
s
Loans and leases
: A valuation of the loans held for investment portfolio was performed by a third party as of the Merger Date to assess the fair value. The loans held for investment portfolio was segmented into three groups, including performing PCD loans, non-performing PCD loans and non-PCD loans. The loans were further pooled based on loan type and risk rating bands. The loans were valued at the loan level using a discounted cash flow analysis. The analysis included projecting cash flows based on the contractual terms of the loans and the cash flows were adjusted to reflect credit loss expectations along with prepayments. Discount rates were developed based on the relative risk of the cash flows, taking into consideration the loan type, market rates as of the valuation date, recent originations in the portfolio, credit loss expectations, and liquidity expectations. Lastly, cash flows adjusted for credit loss expectations were discounted to present value and summed to arrive at the fair value of the loans.
The Company is required to record PCD assets, defined as a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination or issuance, at the purchase price plus the ACL expected at the time of acquisition. Under this method, there is no credit loss expense affecting net income on acquisition of PCD assets. Changes in estimates of expected credit losses after acquisition are recognized in subsequent periods as provision for credit losses (or recapture of credit losses) arises. Any non-credit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets with credit deterioration is allocated to each individual asset. At the acquisition date, the initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis is allocated to individual assets to appropriately allocate any non-credit discount or premium. The non-credit discount or premium, after the adjustment for the ACL, is accreted to interest income using the interest method based on the effective interest rate determined after the adjustment for credit losses at the adoption date.

Of the $
10.9
 billion net loans acquired, $
402.8
 million were identified as PCD assets on the Merger Date.

Premises and equipmen
t: The fair values of premises are based on a market approach, by obtaining third-party appraisals and broker opinions of value for land, office, and branch space.
Core deposit intangibles
: Core deposit intangibles is a measure of certain core deposit products that are acquired in a business combination. The fair value of the core deposit intangibles stemming from any given business combination is based on the present value of the expected cost savings attributable to the core deposit funding relative to an alternative source of funding. The fair value was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology that gave consideration to expected customer attrition rates, net maintenance cost of the deposit base, alternative cost of funds, and the interest costs associated with customer deposits. The intangible assets are being amortized over 
10
 years using the sum-of-years-digits, based upon the period over which estimated economic benefits are estimated to be received.
Deposits:
 The fair values used for the demand and savings deposits equal the amount payable on demand at the Merger Date. The fair values for time deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered to the contractual interest rates on such time deposits.
Borrowings
: The fair values of long-term debt instruments are estimated based on quoted market prices for the instrument if available, or for similar instruments if not available, or by using discounted cash flow analyses, based on current incremental
borrowing rates for similar types of instruments. 
The Company's operating results for the year ended December 31, 2023 include the operating results of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of historical Columbia subsequent to the Merger Date. Disclosure of the amount of historical Columbia’s revenue and net income (excluding integration costs) included in the Consolidated Statements of Income is impracticable due to the integration of the operations and accounting for the Merger.

The number of individual debt securities in an unrealized loss position in the tables above increased to 
1,210
 as of December 31, 2024, as compared to 
600
 at December 31, 2023. These unrealized losses on the debt securities held by the Company were caused by changes in market interest rates or the widening of market spreads subsequent to the initial purchase of these securities and are not due to the underlying credit of the issuers. Management monitors the published credit ratings of the issuers of the debt securities for material rating or outlook changes.

As the decline in fair value of the debt securities is attributable to changes in interest rates or widening market spreads and not credit quality, these investments do not have an ACL as of December 31, 2024.

 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024, loans totaling $
22.0
 billion were pledged to secure borrowings and available lines of credit. 
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the net deferred fees and costs were $
62.0
 million and $
71.8
 million, respectively. Originated loans are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned interest, deferred fees and costs, any partial charge-offs recorded, and interest applied to principal. Purchased loans are recorded at fair value at the date of purchase. The Company evaluates purchased loans for more-than-insignificant deterioration at the date of purchase. Purchased loans that have experienced more-than-insignificant deterioration from origination are considered PCD loans. All other purchased loans are considered non-PCD loans. Total loans and leases also include discounts on acquired loans of $
439.0
 million and $
552.5
 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The outstanding contractual unpaid principal balance of PCD loans, excluding acquisition accounting adjustments, was $
199.9
 million and $
331.9
 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The carrying balance of PCD loans was $
178.5
 million and $
300.2
 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
The Bank, through its commercial equipment leasing subsidiary, FinPac, is a provider of commercial equipment leasing and financing. Direct finance leases are included within the leases and equipment finance segment within the loans and leases, net line item. These direct financing leases typically have terms of 
three
 to 
five years
. Interest income recognized on these leases was $
21.4
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $
18.8
 million for both the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. 
Residual values on leases are established at the time equipment is leased based on an estimate of the value of the leased equipment when the Company expects to dispose of the equipment, typically at the termination of the lease. An annual evaluation is also performed each fiscal year by an independent valuation specialist and equipment residuals are confirmed or adjusted in conjunction with such evaluation.

In the course of managing the loan and lease portfolio, at certain times, management may decide to sell pools of loans and leases. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Bank sold a total of $
148.5
 million and $
743.9
 million, respectively, in loans from its portfolio.

Note 6 – 
Allowance for Credit Losses 
The ACL represents management's estimate of lifetime credit losses for assets within its scope, specifically loans and leases and unfunded commitments. Refer to Note 1 – 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
, for a description of the ACL methodology.
At December 31, 2024, the ACL was $
440.8
 million, a decrease of $
23.3
 million from the December 31, 2023 balance of $
464.1
 million. The change in the total ACL reflects credit migration trends, changes in the economic assumptions, and a recalibration of the commercial CECL model in the first quarter of 2024. To calculate the ACL, management uses models to estimate PD and LGD for loans and leases, incorporating forecasted economic conditions and macroeconomic variables. The Bank considers the current financial environment and various economic scenarios, selecting the most probable scenario at each measurement date. Forecasts for each variable are updated and incorporated into the ACL calculation. Projected macroeconomic variables over the forecast period can materially impact the ACL, with projections becoming less certain over time.
The Bank opted to use the Moody's Analytics' November 2024 consensus economic forecast for estimating the ACL as of December 31, 2024. In the consensus scenario, the probability that the economy will perform better than this consensus is equal to the probability that it will perform worse and included the following variables:

The Bank also uses an additional scenario with varying severity to assess ACL sensitivity and inform qualitative adjustments, keeping economic variables consistent. For this analysis, the Bank selected Moody's Analytics' November 2024 S2 scenario, which predicts a 75% probability of better economic performance and a 25% probability of worse performance. The scenario includes the following variables:
2025
2026

The 2024 forecast is projecting higher GDP growth and unemployment rates with average federal funds rates trending lower. This is compared to the December 31, 2023 ACL calculation which used Moody's Analytics' November 2023 baseline economic forecast to forecast the variables used in the models. 
Management reviewed the results derived from the economic scenarios and subsequent changes to macroeconomic variables for sensitivity analysis, considering these factors when evaluating qualitative adjustments.
Along with the quantitative factors produced by the above models, management also considers prepayment speeds and qualitative factors when determining the ACL. As of December 31, 2024, the Company evaluated qualitative factors and applied upward adjustments to the quantitative results for the ACL, compared to the downward adjustments made as of December 31, 2023. The majority of the qualitative overlays in this period are focused on the commercial loan portfolio. This adjustment is designed to more closely align the portfolio with the S2 scenario, as previously discussed. These overlays account for potential economic uncertainties and sector-specific risks, ensuring that the portfolio remains resilient. Additionally, we have implemented further overlays specifically for the transportation segment of the lease portfolio. This measure is aimed at addressing the unique risks and challenges faced by this industry, such as fluctuating fuel prices, regulatory changes, and market demand variability. By incorporating these targeted overlays, we aim to enhance the accuracy and robustness of our risk management strategy, providing a more comprehensive and adaptive approach to potential economic shifts. While qualitative overlays are applied, approximately 
91
% of the allowance is driven by modeled results, as management determined that the models adequately reflect the significant changes in credit conditions and overall portfolio risk.
Management believes that the ACL was adequate as of December 31, 2024. There is, however, no assurance that future loan losses will not exceed the levels provided for in the ACL and could possibly result in additional charges to the provision for credit losses.
The following tables summarize activity related to the ACL by portfolio segment for the periods indicated:

Asset Quality and Non-Performing Loans and Leases
The Bank manages asset quality and controls credit risk through diversification of the loan and lease portfolio and the application of policies designed to promote sound underwriting and loan and lease monitoring practices. The Bank's Credit Quality Administration department is charged with monitoring asset quality, establishing credit policies and procedures, and enforcing the consistent application of these policies and procedures across the Bank. Reviews of non-performing, past due loans and leases and larger credits, designed to identify potential charges to the allowance for credit losses, and to determine the adequacy of the allowance, are conducted on an ongoing basis. These reviews consider such factors as the financial strength of borrowers, the value of the applicable collateral, loan and lease loss experience, estimated loan and lease losses, growth in the loan and lease portfolio, prevailing economic conditions, and other factors. 
Loans and Leases Past Due and Non-Accrual Loans and Leases 
Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Loans are placed on non-accrual status when, in management’s opinion, the borrower may be unable to meet payment obligations as they become due, as well as when required by regulatory provisions. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, loans and leases on non-accrual status with no related allowance was $
3.6
 million and $
4.9
 million, respectively, excluding collateral dependent loans and leases that have been written down to net realizable value without an associated ACL of $
59.4
 million and $
36.7
 million, respectively. The remaining balance of non-accrual loans are substantially covered by government guarantees. The Company recognized 
no
 interest income on non-accrual loans and leases during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Loan and Lease Modifications Made to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty
The ACL on modified loans or leases is measured using the same credit loss estimation methods used to determine the ACL for all other loans and leases held for investment. These methods incorporate the post-modification loan or lease terms, as well as defaults and charge-offs associated with historical modified loans and leases.
The following tables present the amortized cost basis of loans and leases that were both experiencing financial difficulty and modified during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, by class and type of modification. The percentage of the amortized cost basis of loans and leases that were modified to borrowers in financial distress as compared to the amortized cost basis of each class of financing receivable is also presented below.

Credit Quality Indicators 
Management regularly reviews loans and leases in the portfolio to assess credit quality indicators and to determine appropriate loan classification and grading. The Bank differentiates its lending portfolios into homogeneous and non-homogeneous loans and leases. Homogeneous loans and leases are initially risk rated on a single risk rating scale based on the past due status of the loan or lease. Homogeneous loans and leases that have risk-based modifications or forbearances enter into an alternative elevated risk rating scale that freezes the elevated risk rating and requires six consecutive months of scheduled payments without delinquency before the loan or lease can return to the delinquency-based risk rating scale. 
The Bank's risk rating methodology for its non-homogeneous loans and leases uses a dual risk rating approach to assess the credit risk. This approach uses two scales to provide a comprehensive assessment of credit default risk and recovery risk. The PD scale measures a borrower's credit default risk using risk ratings ranging from 
1
 to 
16
, where a higher rating represents higher risk. For non-homogeneous loans and leases, PD ratings of 
1
 through 
9
 are "pass" grades, while PD ratings of 
10
 and 
11
 are "watch" grades. PD ratings of 12-16 correspond to the regulatory-defined categories of special mention (
12
), substandard (
13
-
14
), doubtful (
15
), and loss (
16
). The loss given default scale measures the amount of loss that may not be recovered in the event of a default, using six alphabetic ratings from A-F, where a higher rating represents higher risk. The LGD scale quantifies recovery risk associated with an event of default and predicts the amount of loss that would be incurred on a loan or lease if a borrower were to experience a major default and includes variables that may be external to the borrower, such as industry, geographic location, and credit cycle stage. It could also include variables specific to the loan or lease, including collateral valuation, covenant structure and debt type. The product of the borrower's PD and a loan or lease LGD is the loan or lease expected loss, expressed as a percentage. This provides a common language of credit risk across different loans.
The PD scale estimates the likelihood that a borrower will experience a major default on any of its debt obligations within a specified time period. Examples of major defaults include payments 
90
 days or more past due, non-accrual classification, bankruptcy filing, or a full or partial charge-off of a loan or lease. As such, the PD scale represents the credit quality indicator for non-homogeneous loans and leases.
The credit quality indicator rating categories follow regulatory classification and can be generally described by the following groupings for loans and leases:
Pass/Watch
—A pass loan or lease is a loan or lease with a credit risk level acceptable to the Bank for extending credit and maintaining normal credit monitoring. A watch loan or lease

is considered pass rated but has a heightened level of unacceptable default risk due to an emerging risk element or declining performance trend. Watch ratings are expected to be temporary, with issues resolved or manifested to the extent that a higher or lower risk rating would be appropriate within a short period of time. 
Special Mention—
A special mention loan or lease has potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the institution's credit position at some future date. These borrowers have an elevated probability of default but not to the point of a substandard classification. 
Substandard—
A substandard loan or lease is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans and leases classified as substandard have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
Doubtful
—Loans or leases classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, based on currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.
Loss
—Loans or leases classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
The Company had $
1.0
 billion in goodwill as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, which represents the excess of the total acquisition price paid over the fair value of the assets acquired, net of fair value of liabilities assumed in connection with the Merger. The Company performed its annual impairment assessment as of October 31 and concluded that there was no impairment. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, it was determined there were no events or circumstances which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying amount.
Core deposit intangible assets values were determined based on the present value of the expected cost savings attributable to the core deposit funding relative to an alternative source of funding. The intangible assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis over a period of 
10
 years. 
No
 impairment losses have been recognized in the periods presented.

The sensitivity analysis presents the hypothetical effect on fair value of the MSR, due to the change in assumptions. The effect of such hypothetical change in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in an assumption to the change in fair value is not linear. Additionally, in the analysis, the impact of an adverse change in one assumption is calculated independent of any impact on other assumptions. In reality, changes in one assumption may change another assumption. The Company has entered into a fair value hedge by purchasing interest rate futures and forward settling mortgage-backed securities to hedge the interest rate risk of MSRs. Refer to Note 17 – 
Derivatives
 for further information.

The Company has not consolidated the accounts of the Trusts in its consolidated financial statements as they are considered to be variable interest entities for which the Company is not a primary beneficiary. As a result, the junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company to the Trusts are reflected on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as junior subordinated debentures. The Trusts are reflected as junior subordinated debentures, either at fair value or at amortized cost. The common stock issued by the Trusts is recorded in other assets and totaled $
14.3
 million as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. As of December 31, 2024, all of the junior subordinated debentures were redeemable at par, at their applicable quarterly or semiannual interest payment dates.
The Company selected the fair value measurement option for junior subordinated debentures originally issued by UHC prior to the Merger (the Umpqua Statutory Trusts) and for junior subordinated debentures acquired by UHC from Sterling Financial Corporation prior to the Merger. The fair value of the junior subordinated debentures increased during the year due to movements in the spot curve and forward rates. A loss of $
14.8
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to a gain of $
7.9
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, was recorded in other comprehensive income.

Employee Benefit Plans
Employee Savings Plan
Substantially all of the Company's employees are eligible to participate in the Umpqua Bank 401(k) and Profit Sharing Plan, a defined contribution and profit sharing plan sponsored by the Company. Employees may elect to contribute a portion of their salary to the plan in accordance with Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. At the discretion of the Board of Directors, the Company may make matching and/or profit sharing contributions based on profits of the Bank. The Company's contributions charged to expense amounted to $
13.6
 million, $
20.9
 million, and $
10.6
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company maintains an ESPP in which substantially all of the Company's employees are eligible to participate. The ESPP provides participants the opportunity to purchase common stock of the Company at a discounted price. Under the ESPP, participants purchase common stock of the Company for 
90
% of the lowest price on either the first or last day in the look-back period of 
six months
. In 2024, the ESPP had a single offering period from July 1st to December 31st, with 
no
 purchases completed during 2024. At December 31, 2024, there were 
877,000
 shares available for purchase under the ESPP, 
78,000
 shares were purchased in January 2025 for $
1.4
 million, following the closing of the July 1st to December 31st 2024 offering period. In 2023, historical Columbia employees participated in the ESPP for the period from January 1st to June 30th of 2023 and purchased 
58,000
 shares for $
1.2
 million. 
Supplemental Retirement/Deferred Compensation Plans
The Company has established a Supplemental Retirement & Deferred Compensation Plan (SRP/DCP), a nonqualified deferred compensation plan designed to supplement the retirement income of certain highly compensated executives selected by resolution of the Board. The SRP/DCP has two components: a supplemental retirement plan and a deferred compensation plan. The Company may make discretionary contributions to the SRP. The SRP balances as of December 31, 2024, and 2023 were $
536,000
 and $
517,000
, respectively, and are recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under the DCP, eligible officers may elect to defer up to 
50
% of their salary into a plan account. The DCP balance was $
14.1
 million and $
13.1
 million as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Additionally, the Company has established an SRP for a former CEO. The balance for this plan was $
7.8
 million and $
8.2
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In connection with the closing of the Merger, the Company established a deferred compensation plan for certain executives. The balances for this plan were $
11.6
 million and $
8.5
 million as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
In connection with the Merger, the Company assumed a SERP, which is unsecured and unfunded with no program assets. The SERP's projected benefit obligation, representing the vested net present value of future payments to individuals under the plan, is accrued over the estimated remaining term of employment of the participants and was determined by actuarial valuation using a discount rate of 
5.60
% for 2024 and 
5.02
% for 2023. Additional assumptions and features of the plan include a normal retirement age of 
65
 and a 
2
% annual cost of living benefit adjustment. The projected benefit obligation of $
18.0
 million for 2024 and $
18.8
 million for 2023 is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Acquired Plans
In connection with prior acquisitions, the Bank assumed liability for certain salary continuation, supplemental retirement, and deferred compensation plans for key employees, retired employees, and directors of acquired institutions. No additional contributions have been made to these plans since the effective date of the acquisitions. These unfunded plans provide for the payment of a specified amount on a monthly basis for a specified period (generally 
10
 to 
20
 years) after retirement. In the event of a participant employee's death prior to or during retirement, the Bank may be obligated to pay the designated beneficiary the benefits outlined in the plans. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, liabilities recorded for the estimated present value of future plan benefits totaled $
47.2
 million and $
49.0
 million, respectively, and are recorded in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, expense recorded for these benefits totaled $
4.1
 million, $
4.8
 million, and $
1.5
 million, respectively. 
Rabbi Trusts
The Bank has established irrevocable rabbi trusts for the SRP/DCP plan and sponsors similar trusts for certain deferred compensation plans assumed from prior mergers. The trust assets, generally trading assets, are consolidated in the Company's balance sheets with the associated liabilities, equal to the asset balances, included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the asset and liability balances related to these trusts were $
15.9
 million and $
13.7
 million, respectively. 
Bank-Owned Life Insurance
The Bank has purchased, or acquired through mergers, life insurance policies in connection with certain executive supplemental income, salary continuation and deferred compensation retirement plans. These policies, for which the Bank is the owner and sole or partial beneficiary, provide protection against the adverse financial effects of a key employee's death and offer tax-exempt income to offset plan expenses. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the cash surrender value of these policies was $
693.8
 million and $
680.9
 million, respectively. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, and 2023, the Bank had liabilities for post-retirement benefits payable to other partial beneficiaries under some of these life insurance policies of $
6.2
 million and $
6.3
 million, respectively. The Bank is exposed to credit risk if an insurance company cannot fulfill its financial obligations under a policy. To mitigate this risk, the Bank uses a variety of insurance companies and regularly monitors their financial condition.

The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet credit risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees. These instruments involve elements of credit and interest-rate risk similar to the risk involved in on-balance sheet items. The contract or notional amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of the Bank's involvement in particular classes of financial instruments. 

The Bank's exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, and financial guarantees written, is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. 
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any covenant or condition established in the applicable contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. While most standby letters of credit are not utilized, a significant portion of such utilization is on an immediate payment basis. The Bank evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by the Bank upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral varies but may include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, premises and equipment and income-producing commercial properties. 

Standby letters of credit and written financial guarantees are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including international trade finance, commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Bank holds cash, marketable securities, or real estate as collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary. There were 
no
 financial guarantees in connection with standby letters of credit that the Bank was required to perform on during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $
183.3
 million of standby letters of credit expire within one year, and $
33.1
 million expire thereafter. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Bank recorded approximately $
2.9
 million and $
2.5
 million, respectively, in fees associated with standby letters of credit.
Residential mortgage loans sold into the secondary market are sold with limited recourse against the Company, meaning that the Company may be obligated to repurchase or otherwise reimburse the investor for incurred losses on any loans that suffer an early payment default, are not underwritten in accordance with investor guidelines or are determined to have pre-closing borrower misrepresentations.
Legal Proceedings and Regulatory Matters—
The Company is subject to litigation in court and arbitral proceedings, as well as proceedings, investigations, examinations, and other actions brought or considered by governmental and self-regulatory agencies. The Company is party to various pending and threatened claims and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business activities, some of which involve claims for substantial or uncertain amounts.
In September 2023, 
34
 related entities (the “iCap Entities”) that maintained their primary deposit accounts with the Bank filed jointly-administered Chapter 11 bankruptcies in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Washington. The Bank was served with a request for production of account records and produced such records through counsel. Concurrently, in pleadings filed in the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Washington on behalf of investors who claimed losses of approximately $
290.0
 million, the Bank was identified as a party against which claims may be brought in connection with the iCap Entities’ alleged operation of Ponzi schemes prior to the bankruptcy proceedings described above. The potential claims against the Bank and the amount of any alleged damages have not been identified. To the extent suits or actions are commenced, the Bank intends to vigorously defend any and all claims.

In August 2020, a class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court (ND Cal) alleging aiding and abetting claims against the Bank associated with the failure of two commercial real estate investment companies, Professional Financial Investors, Inc. and Professional Investors Security Fund, Inc., allegedly effected through a Ponzi scheme. Both companies maintained their primary deposit account relationship with the Bank’s Novato, Marin County, California branch office, acquired by the Bank from Circle Bank. The Bank's motion to dismiss was denied in January 2021, and its motion for summary judgment was denied in December 2022, and at the same time the District Court certified the plaintiffs’ proposed class. Two other related cases were filed in 2023: one case alleges similar claims by two investors and was filed in May 2023 in Marin County Superior Court; and another case was filed in June 2023 in the United States District Court (ND Cal) alleging claims by ten investors with different investments than the class members. The case filed in June 2023 was dismissed in July 2024 due to the plaintiffs' lack of standing. Plaintiffs in the District Court class action case allege damages resulting from the scheme of between $
297.4
 million and $
368.1
 million, which includes prejudgment interest. The Superior Court case does not yet have a clear estimate of damages. Trial in the District Court class action case commenced on February 3, 2025. Filing of these cases follows an SEC non-public investigation of Professional Financial Investors, Inc. and Professional Investors Security Fund, Inc. that commenced on May 28, 2020. The Bank intends to defend these matters vigorously and believes that it has meritorious defenses.
As previously disclosed, in 2023, the Bank was informed by one of its technology service providers (the "Vendor") that a widely reported security incident involving MOVEit, a filesharing software used globally by government agencies, enterprise corporations, and financial institutions, resulted in the unauthorized acquisition by a third party of the names and social security numbers or tax identification numbers of certain of the Bank’s consumer and small business customers (the "Vendor Incident").
Other than the information described above, no account information for accounts at the Bank was compromised as a result of the Vendor Incident, and no information from the Bank’s commercial customers was involved in the Vendor Incident. On June 22, 2023, the Bank sent an email to potentially affected consumer and small business customers informing them of the Vendor Incident. Between August 11, 2023, and August 15, 2023, the Vendor, on behalf of the Bank, initiated formal notice via U.S. Mail to the 429,252 Bank customers whose information was involved in the Vendor Incident. The Bank and the Vendor also notified applicable federal and state regulators regarding the Vendor Incident.
Beginning on August 18, 2023, some of the individuals who were notified of the Vendor Incident filed lawsuits against the Bank seeking monetary recovery and other relief on behalf of themselves and one or more putative classes of other individuals similarly situated. Two such cases were filed in federal court (the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington), one of which was later voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. Five such cases were filed in state court in Washington (the Washington Superior Court for Pierce County) and one case in state court in California (the California Superior Court for Contra Costa County). The state court cases were subsequently removed to federal court by the Bank. On October 4, 2023, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, in view of the large number of lawsuits arising out of the MOVEit data incident in federal courts across the United States, initiated a multidistrict litigation (“MDL”) for these cases to allow such cases to be transferred to one court for pre-trial proceedings. The MDL is titled 
In Re: MOVEit Customer Data Security Breach Litigation
, MDL No. 3083 and is pending in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts as MDL No. 1:23-md-03083-ADB-PGL. All seven cases against the Bank have been transferred to the MDL as of January 29, 2024. The cases collectively allege claims for negligence, negligence 
per se
, breach of contract, breach of implied contract, breach of third-party beneficiary contract, breach of fiduciary duty, invasion of privacy, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment and violation of certain statutes, namely the Washington Consumer Protection Act, the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the California Unfair Competition Law. The Bank has also received claims by or on behalf of individuals in connection with the Vendor Incident. Such claims have the potential to give rise to additional litigation. The Bank has engaged defense counsel and intends to vigorously defend against these suits and any similar or related suits or claims. The Bank has notified relevant insurance carriers and business counterparties and continues to reserve all of its relevant rights to indemnity, defense, contribution, and other relief in connection with these matters.

At least quarterly, liabilities and contingencies are assessed in connection with all outstanding or new legal matters, utilizing the most recent information available. If it is determined that a loss from a matter is probable and that the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, an accrual for the loss is established. Once established, each accrual is adjusted as appropriate to reflect any subsequent developments in the specific legal matter. It is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. Actual losses may be in excess of any established accrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. Management's estimate will change from time to time. For matters where a loss is not probable, or the amount of the loss cannot be estimated, no accrual is established. The Company has $
2.2
 million accrued related to legal matters as of December 31, 2024.
The resolution and the outcome of legal claims are unpredictable, exacerbated by factors including the following: damages sought are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; it is unclear whether a case brought as a class action will be allowed to proceed on that basis; discovery or motion practice is not complete; the proceeding is not yet in its final stages; the matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; there are a large number of parties, including multiple defendants; or there is a wide range of potential results. Any estimate or determination relating to the future resolution of legal and regulatory matters is uncertain and involves significant judgment. The Company is usually unable to determine whether a favorable or unfavorable outcome is remote, reasonably likely or probable, or to estimate the amount or range of a probable or reasonably likely loss until relatively late in the process. 
Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of a specific legal matter, the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against us in our currently outstanding legal matters, and the Company intends to continue to vigorously defend ourselves. The Company will consider settlement of legal matters when, in management's judgment, it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage, and established reserves, the Company believes that the eventual outcome of the actions against us will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material to the Company's results of operations for any particular reporting period.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
— The Bank grants real estate mortgage, real estate construction, commercial, agricultural and installment loans and leases to customers in Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah. In management's judgment, a concentration exists in real estate-related loans, which represented approximately 
75
% of the Bank's loan and lease portfolio for both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Commercial real estate concentrations are managed to ensure geographic and business diversity, primarily in our footprint. As of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the multifamily portfolio, including construction, represented approximately 
19
% of the total loan portfolio. The office portfolio represented approximately 
8
% of the total loan portfolio as of both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Although management believes such concentrations have no more than the normal risk of collectability, a substantial decline in the economy in general, material increases in interest rates, changes in tax policies, tightening credit or refinancing markets, or a decline in real estate values in the Bank's primary market areas in particular, could have an adverse impact on the repayment of these loans. Personal and business incomes, proceeds from the sale of real property, or proceeds from refinancing represent the primary sources of repayment for a majority of these loans. 

The Bank recognizes the credit risks inherent in dealing with other depository institutions. Accordingly, to prevent excessive exposure to any single correspondent, the Bank has established general standards for selecting correspondent banks as well as internal limits for allowable exposure to any single correspondent. In addition, the Bank has an investment policy that sets forth limitations that apply to all investments with respect to credit rating and concentrations with an issuer.
Related-Party Transactions
— In the ordinary course of business, the Bank has made loans to related parties, including its directors and executive officers (and their associated and affiliated companies). All such loans have been made in accordance with regulatory requirements, are on substantially the same terms and underwriting as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated persons, and do not involve higher than normal risk of collectability. The Bank has 
no
 material related-party transactions requiring disclosure.
Note 17 – 
Derivatives 

The Bank may use derivatives to hedge the risk of changes in the fair values of interest rate lock commitments, residential mortgage loans held for sale, and MSRs. None of the Company's derivatives are designated as hedging instruments. Rather, they are accounted for as free-standing derivatives, or economic hedges, with changes in the fair value of the derivatives reported in income. The Company utilizes forward interest rate contracts in its derivative risk management strategy. 
124
Table of 
Conte
n
t
s
The Bank enters into forward delivery contracts to sell residential mortgage loans or mortgage-backed securities to broker-dealers at specific prices and dates in order to hedge the interest rate risk in its portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale and its residential mortgage interest rate lock commitments. Credit risk associated with forward contracts is limited to the replacement cost of those forward contracts in a gain position. There were 
no
 counterparty default losses on forward contracts in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Market risk with respect to forward contracts arises principally from changes in the value of contractual positions due to changes in interest rates. The Bank limits its exposure to market risk by monitoring differences between commitments to customers and forward contracts with broker-dealers. In the event the Company has forward delivery contract commitments in excess of available mortgage loans, the Company completes the transaction by either paying or receiving a fee to or from the broker-dealer equal to the increase or decrease in the market value of the forward contract. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank had commitments to originate mortgage loans held for sale totaling $
46.2
 million and $
20.6
 million, respectively, and forward sales commitments of $
76.5
 million and $
39.5
 million, respectively, which are used to hedge both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures. 
The Bank purchases interest rate futures and forward settling mortgage-backed securities to hedge the interest rate risk of MSRs. As of December 31, 2024, the Bank had $
187.0
 million notional of interest rate futures contracts and $
12.0
 million of mortgage-backed securities related to this program. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank had $
150.0
 million notional of interest rate futures contracts and $
36.0
 million of mortgage-backed securities related to this program.
The Bank executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting the interest rate swaps that the Bank executes with a third party, such that the Bank minimizes its net risk exposure. As of December 31, 2024, the Bank had interest rate swap assets with a notional amount of $
4.3
 billion and interest rate swap liabilities with a notional amount of $
4.4
 billion related to this program. As of December 31, 2023, the Bank had interest rate swap assets and interest rate swap liabilities, both with a notional amount of $
4.7
 billion related to this program.
The Bank has collateral posting requirements for initial margins with its clearing members and clearing houses and is required to post collateral against its obligations under these agreements of $
87.2
 million and $
88.3
 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
The Bank's clearable interest rate swap derivatives are cleared through the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and London Clearing House. These clearing houses characterize the variation margin payments, for certain derivative contracts that are referred to as settled-to-market, as settlements of the derivative's mark-to-market exposure and not collateral. The Company accounts for the variation margin as an adjustment to cash collateral, as well as a corresponding adjustment to the derivative asset and liability. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the variation margin netting adjustments for centrally cleared interest rate swaps consisted of derivative asset adjustments of $
173.9
 million and $
166.3
 million, respectively.
The Bank also has solely executed swaps indexed to Term SOFR, which are not clearable. These swaps are executed on a bilateral basis with a counterparty bank. There is no initial margin posted for bilateral swaps, but cash collateral equivalent to variation margin is exchanged to cover the mark-to-market exposure on a daily basis. 
The Bank also executes foreign currency hedges as a service for customers. These foreign currency hedges are then offset with hedges with other third-party banks to limit the Bank's risk exposure. 
The Bank's derivative assets are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, while the derivative liabilities are included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Stock Compensation
Stock-based awards are eligible for issuance under the Company’s Incentive Compensation Plan to executives, directors and key employees. The 2024 Equity Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders and authorized the issuance of up to 
7.5
 million shares as equity compensation. The 2024 plan replaced the 2018 Equity Inventive Plan, which ceased to grant awards as of that date. The plan authorizes the issuance of RSAs, RSUs, and performance unit awards. As of December 31, 2024, there were 
6.9
 million shares available for future issuance. 
Total compensation cost related to restricted shares of Company stock granted to employees is included in salaries and employee benefits of the Consolidated Statements of Income and the income tax benefit or deficiency related to the vesting of RSUs and RSAs is recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the period the shares are vested.

The Company's restricted stock plans provide for the payment of withholding taxes by tendering previously owned or recently vested shares. Restricted shares cancelled to pay withholding taxes totaled 
285,000
, 
261,000
, and 
120,000
 shares during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. 
Restricted Stock Units
The Company grants RSUs periodically to employees and directors. RSUs provide for an interest in Company common stock to the recipient, with such units held in escrow until certain conditions are met. RSUs provide for vesting requirements that include time-based, performance-based, or market-based conditions. RSUs generally vest over 
three years
, subject to time or time plus performance vesting conditions. Recipients of RSUs do not pay any cash consideration to the Company for the units and the holders of the restricted units do not have voting rights; however, the holder accrues dividends, which are paid out when the shares vest. The fair value of time-based and performance-based units is equal to the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the grant date. The fair value of market-based units is estimated on the grant date using the Monte Carlo simulation model, which incorporates assumptions as to stock price volatility, the expected life of awards, a risk-free interest rate and dividend yield.

 Note 19 – 
Regulatory Capital
The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material effect on the Company and the Bank's operations and financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about risk components, asset risk weighting, and other factors. 
As permitted by the regulatory capital rules, the Company and the Bank elected the CECL transition option that delayed the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of CECL over a five-year transition period ending December 31, 2024. The Company elected this capital relief to delay the estimated regulatory capital impact of adopting CECL, relative to the incurred loss methodology's effect on regulatory capital. The Company phased out the cumulative adjustment as calculated at the end of 2021, by adjusting it by 
75
% in 2022, 
50
% in 2023, and 
25
% through the end of 2024.
Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total capital, Tier 1 capital, and Tier 1 common to risk-weighted assets (as defined in the applicable regulations), and of Tier 1 capital to average assets (as defined in the applicable regulations). Basel III also requires banking organizations to maintain a capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions, stock repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital conservation buffer is exclusively comprised of CET1 capital, and it applies to each of the three risk-based capital ratios but not to the leverage ratio. The capital conservation buffer is fully phased-in at 2.5%, such that the CET1, Tier 1, and total capital ratio minimums inclusive of the capital conservation buffers were 
7
%, 
8.5
%, and 
10.5
%. Management believes, as of December 31, 2024, that the Company meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.

The following methods were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument that is carried at fair value in the tables above: 

Securities
— Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices when available or through the use of alternative approaches, such as matrix or model pricing, or broker indicative bids, when market quotes are not readily accessible or available. Management periodically reviews the pricing information received from the third-party pricing service and compares it to a secondary pricing service, evaluating significant price variances between services to determine an appropriate estimate of fair value to report. 

Loans Held for Sale
— Fair value for residential mortgage loans originated as held for sale is determined based on quoted secondary market prices for similar loans, including the implicit fair value of embedded servicing rights. For loans not originated as held for sale, these loans are accounted for at lower of cost or market, with the fair value estimated based on the expected sales price.
Loans and leases
— Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type, including commercial, real estate, and consumer loans. Each loan category is further segregated by fixed and adjustable-rate loans. The fair value of loans is calculated by discounting expected cash flows at rates at which similar loans are currently being made. This model is periodically validated by an independent model validation group. These amounts are discounted further by embedded probable losses expected to be realized in the portfolio. For loans originated as held for sale and transferred into loans held for investment, the fair value is determined based on quoted secondary market prices for similar loans.
132
Table of 
Conte
n
t
s
Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights
— The fair value of MSR is estimated using a DCF model. Assumptions used include market discount rates, anticipated prepayment speeds, delinquency and foreclosure rates, and ancillary fee income net of servicing costs. This model is periodically validated by an independent model validation group. The model assumptions and the MSR fair value estimates are also compared to observable trades of similar portfolios as well as to MSR broker valuations and industry surveys, as available. Management believes the significant inputs utilized are indicative of those that would be used by market participants. 

Junior Subordinated Debentures
— The fair value of junior subordinated debentures is estimated using an income approach valuation technique. The significant unobservable input utilized in the estimation of fair value of these instruments is the credit risk adjusted spread. The credit risk adjusted spread represents the non-performance risk of the liability, contemplating the inherent risk of the obligation. The Company periodically utilizes a valuation firm to determine or validate the reasonableness of inputs and factors that are used to determine the fair value. The ending carrying (fair) value of the junior subordinated debentures measured at fair value represents the estimated amount that would be paid to transfer these liabilities in an orderly transaction among market participants. Due to credit concerns in the capital markets and inactivity in the trust preferred markets that have limited the observability of market spreads, the Company has classified this as a Level 3 fair value measurement.

Derivative Instruments
— The fair value of the interest rate lock commitments, interest rate futures, and forward sales commitments are estimated using quoted or published market prices for similar instruments, adjusted for factors such as pull-through rate assumptions based on historical information, where appropriate. The pull-through rate assumptions are considered Level 3 valuation inputs and are significant to the interest rate lock commitment valuation; as such, the interest rate lock commitment derivatives are classified as Level 3. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is determined using a DCF technique incorporating credit valuation adjustments to reflect non-performance risk in the measurement of fair value. Although the Bank has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its interest rate swap derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the CVA associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. However, as of December 31, 2024, the Bank has assessed the significance of the impact of the CVA on the overall valuation of its interest rate swap positions and has determined that the CVA are not significant to the overall valuation of its interest rate swap derivatives. As a result, the Bank has classified its interest rate swap and futures derivative valuations in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Generally, increases in the constant prepayment rate or the discount rate utilized in the fair value measurement of the residential mortgage servicing rights will result in a decrease in fair value. Conversely, decreases in the constant prepayment rate or the discount rate will result in an increase in fair value.
An increase in the pull-through rate utilized in the fair value measurement of the interest rate lock commitment derivative will result in an increase in the fair value measurement. Conversely, a decrease in the pull-through rate will result in a decrease in the fair value measurement.
Management believes that the credit risk adjusted spread utilized in the fair value measurement of the junior subordinated debentures carried at fair value is indicative of the non-performance risk premium a willing market participant would require under current market conditions, which is an inactive market. Generally, an increase in the credit spread will result in a decrease in the estimated fair value. Conversely, a decrease in the credit spread will result in an increase in the estimated fair value.

Changes in residential mortgage servicing rights carried at fair value are recorded in residential mortgage banking revenue within non-interest income. Gains (losses) on interest rate lock commitments carried at fair value are recorded in residential mortgage banking revenue within non-interest income.
The contractual interest expense on the junior subordinated debentures is recorded on an accrual basis as interest on junior subordinated debentures within interest expense. Settlements related to the junior subordinated debentures represent the payment of accrued interest that is embedded in the fair value of these liabilities. The change in fair value of junior subordinated debentures is attributable to the change in the instrument specific credit risk; accordingly, the unrealized losses of $
14.8
 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, were recorded net of tax as other comprehensive losses of $
11.0
 million. Comparatively, unrealized gains of $
7.9
 million were recorded net of tax as other comprehensive gains of $
5.8
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The change recorded for the year ended December 31, 2024 was mainly due to modest movements in the spot curve and forward rates, partially offset by decreases in the credit spreads. 
Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis

From time to time, certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These adjustments to fair value generally result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets due to impairment, typically on collateral-dependent loans. 
The following tables present information about the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis for which a nonrecurring change in fair value was recorded during the reporting period. The amounts disclosed below represent the fair values at the time the nonrecurring fair value measurements were made, and not necessarily the fair value as of the dates reported upon.

The following provides a description of the valuation technique and inputs for the Company's assets and liabilities classified as Level 3 and measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Unobservable inputs and qualitative information about the unobservable inputs are not presented as the fair value is determined by third-party information for loans and leases.
The loans and leases amounts above represent collateral-dependent loans and leases that have been adjusted to fair value. When a loan or non-homogeneous lease is identified as collateral-dependent, the Bank measures the impairment using the current fair value of the collateral, less estimated selling costs. Depending on the characteristics of a loan or lease, the fair value of collateral is generally estimated by obtaining external appraisals, but in some cases the value of the collateral may be estimated as having little to no value. When a homogeneous lease or equipment finance agreement becomes 181 days past due, it is determined that the collateral has little to no value. If it is determined that the value of the collateral-dependent loan or lease is less than its recorded investment, the Bank recognizes this impairment and adjusts the carrying value of the loan or lease to fair value, less costs to sell, through the ACL. The loss represents charge-offs on collateral-dependent loans and leases for fair value adjustments based on the fair value of collateral.

The Bank elected to measure certain residential mortgage loans held for sale under the fair value option, with interest income on these loans held for sale reported in interest and fees on loans and leases on the Consolidated Statements of Income. This reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges for these assets. Residential mortgage loans held for sale accounted for under the fair value option are measured initially at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Gains and losses from such changes in fair value are reported as a component of residential mortgage banking revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 the Company recorded a net increase in fair value of $
19,000
, a net decrease of $
342,000
, and a net decrease of $
10.7
 million, respectively.
Management's intent to sell certain residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale may change over time due to factors including changes in overall market liquidity or changes in characteristics specific to certain loans held for sale. Consequently, these loans may be reclassified as loans held for investment and maintained in the Bank's loan portfolio. In the event that loans currently classified as held for sale are reclassified as loans held for investment, the loans will continue to be measured at fair value. Gains and losses from changes in fair value for these loans are reported in earnings as a component of other income and interest income on these loans are reported in interest and fees on loans and leases on the Consolidated Statements of Income. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a net decrease in fair value of $
10.5
 million, as compared to a net increase in fair value of $
2.6
 million for the year ended December 31, 2023.
The Company selected the fair value measurement option for certain junior subordinated debentures originally issued by UHC prior to the Merger (the Umpqua Statutory Trusts) and for junior subordinated debentures acquired by UHC from Sterling Financial Corporation prior to the Merger, with changes in fair value recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. The remaining junior subordinated debentures were acquired through business combinations and were measured at fair value at the time of acquisition and subsequently measured at amortized cost.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company's gross deferred tax assets included $
1.9
 million and $
2.4
 million, respectively, of NOL carryforwards expiring in tax years 2030-2032. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has determined there is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain of its federal and state NOL and tax carryforwards will be realized. The Company has determined that 
no
 valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets is required as management believes it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the remaining gross deferred tax assets of $
660.9
 million and $
693.6
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, as well as the majority of states. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. income tax examinations for years prior to 2021 and is no longer subject to state income tax examinations for years prior to 2020.
The Company periodically reviews its income tax positions based on tax laws and regulations and financial reporting considerations, and records adjustments as appropriate. This review takes into consideration the status of current taxing authorities' examinations of the Company's tax returns, recent positions taken by the taxing authorities on similar transactions, if any, and the overall tax environment.
The Company had 
no
 gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Interest on unrecognized tax benefits is reported by the Company as a component of tax expense. There were 
no
 amounts related to interest and penalties recognized for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Investment Tax Credits
The Company is involved in various entities that are considered to be variable interest entities, which are primarily related to investments promoting affordable housing and trust preferred securities. The Company is not required to consolidate variable interest entities in which it has concluded it does not have a controlling financial interest, and thus not the primary beneficiary. In such cases, the Company does not have both the power to direct the entities' most significant activities and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. The maximum exposure to loss in the LIHTC is the amount of equity invested and credit extended by the Company. Refer to Note 14 – 
Junior and Other Subordinated Debentures 
for further discussion of junior subordinated debentures.
Affordable Housing Tax Credit Investments
The Company makes certain equity investments in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects; the purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the sale of additional affordable housing product offerings, and to assist in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. The primary activities of the limited partnerships include the identification, development, and operation of multi-family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants. 
The Company’s investments in these entities generate a return primarily through the realization of federal income tax credits and other tax benefits, such as tax deductions from operating losses of the investments, over specified time periods. These tax credits and deductions are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense.
The Company records the investments in affordable housing partnerships as a component of other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and uses the proportional amortization method to account for the investments. Amortization related to these investments is recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company's unfunded capital commitments to these investments is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
In 2023, the Company recorded $
47.2
 million of affordable housing investments and $
40.9
 million of related unfunded capital commitments associated with the Merger.

Segment Reporting
The Company has 
one
 reportable segment based on the products and services offered, primarily banking operations as well as the operations, technology, and administrative functions of the Bank and Holding Company. The Company primarily derives revenue from banking operations by providing consumer and residential real estate loans, commercial lending products, deposit products, and treasury and wealth management services. The Company's primary market areas are in Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, and Nevada and manages the business activities on a consolidated basis. The accounting policies of the Bank are the same as those described in Note 1 -
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

The Company's CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM assesses performance and decides how to allocate resources based on consolidated net income that is reported on the Consolidated Statements of Income as net income. The measure of segment assets is total consolidated assets which is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as total assets. 
The CODM uses consolidated net income to evaluate income generated from segment assets in making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources. Net income is used to monitor budget versus actual results. The CODM also uses consolidated net income in competitive analysis by benchmarking to the Company's competitors. The competitive analysis along with the monitoring of budgeted versus actual results are used in assessing performance of the segment and in establishing management’s compensation. 
The CODM is regularly provided with expense information at a level consistent with that disclosed in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.

As of December 31, 2024, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer, and Principal Accounting Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us that is required to be included in our periodic SEC filings.
Although management changes and improves our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis, we do not believe that any such changes occurred in the fourth quarter 2024 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
The management of Columbia Banking System, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:
•
Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets; 
•
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with the authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and 
•
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). This assessment included controls over the preparation of the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements in accordance with the instructions for the consolidated financial statements for Bank Holding Companies (Form FR Y-9C) to meet the reporting requirements of Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act. Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. 
The Company's independent registered public accounting firm has audited the Company's consolidated financial statements that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 and issued their Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, appearing under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The audit report expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.

ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION
Insider Trading Arrangements and Policies
A significant portion of the compensation of our executive officers is delivered in the form of equity awards, including time-vested restricted stock unit awards, and time-vested stock awards that vest ratably over three-year periods, and performance-based restricted stock unit awards. that typically vest over a three-year performance period. This compensation design is intended to align executive compensation with the performance experienced by our shareholders. Following the delivery of shares of our common stock under those equity awards, once any applicable service-, time- or performance-based vesting standards have been satisfied, our executive officers from time to time engage in the open-market sale of some of those shares. Certain of our officers have elected to have shares withheld at the time of vesting to cover withholding taxes.
Our directors and executive officers may also engage from time to time in other transactions involving our securities. Transactions in our securities by our directors and executive officers are required to be made in accordance with our Insider Trading and Information Policy, which, among other things, requires that the transactions be in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws that prohibit trading while in possession of material non-public information. Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense that enables pre-arranged transactions in securities in a manner that avoids concerns about initiating transactions at a future date while possibly in possession of material non-public information. Our Insider Trading and Information Policy permits our directors and executive officers to enter into trading plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1.
On 
December 3, 2024
, 
Torran Nixon
, 
Senior Executive Vice President
 of the Company, 
adopted
 a trading arrangement for the sale of shares of stock (a “Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan”) that is intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1(c). Mr. Nixon's Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan provides for termination on 
March 7, 2025
 (subject to earlier termination for certain customary termination events) and for the sale of up to 
7,461
 shares of common stock.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, other than disclosed above, none of our directors or officers adopted or terminated a trading plan intended to satisfy 
Rule 10b5-1
 or any "
non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement
," as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.
Certain of our officers and directors have made elections to participate in, and are participating in, our 401(k) and profit sharing plan and have made, and may from time to time make, elections to (i) have shares withheld to cover withholding taxes or (ii) have dividends from Columbia common stock reinvested into Columbia common stock, (iii) have a portion of their 401(k) account contributions used to purchase Columbia common stock, or (iv) participate in the employee stock purchase plan, which may be designed to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act or may constitute non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K). 
Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.

Executive Change in Control and Severance Plan (the "Plan"). The Participation Agreements are effective upon expiration of existing arrangements for Mr. Merrywell and Mr. Nixon on March 1, 2025. Under the Plan, if a Named Executive’s employment is terminated by Columbia without Cause or the Named Executive terminates their employment with Columbia for Good Reason following the effective date of the applicable Participation Agreement (as such terms “Cause” and “Good Reason” are defined in the Plan, each a “Qualifying Termination”), in each case not in connection with a change in control, the Named Executive will be entitled to receive, subject to execution and non-revocation of a release of claims, cash severance equal to one year’s base salary. If a Named Executive experiences a Qualifying Termination within six months prior to, or within 24 months following, a change in control, the Named Executive will be entitled to receive, subject to execution and non-revocation of a release of claims, (1) cash severance equal to two times the sum of the Named Executive’s annual base salary and target annual bonus, (2) a prorated target bonus for the year of termination, (3) continued health and welfare benefits for 18 months, and (4) vesting of any outstanding equity awards granted in full with respect to any service vesting requirement, and any awards subject to a performance-vesting condition will remain outstanding and eligible to be earned in full based on the level of performance achieved as if the Named Executive had remained employed for the duration of the performance period. The Named Executives will be subject to customary restrictive covenants, including non-competition and non-solicitation covenants, during employment and for up to two years thereafter.
