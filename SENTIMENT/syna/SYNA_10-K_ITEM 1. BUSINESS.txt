Customers
Our customers include many of the world’s largest mobile and PC OEMs, based on unit shipments, as well as many large IoT OEMs, automotive manufacturers and a variety of consumer electronics manufacturers. Our demonstrated track record of technological leadership, design innovation, product performance, cost-effectiveness and on-time deliveries has contributed to our position as a go-to supplier of human experience semiconductor product solutions. We believe our strong relationship with our OEM customers, many of which are also currently developing product solutions, aligned with our target markets, will continue to position us as a preferred partner.
We generally supply our products to OEMs through their contract manufacturers, supply chain partners or distributors. We consider both the OEMs and their contract manufacturers or supply chain partners to be our customers, as well as in some cases, our distributors. Both the OEMs and their partners may determine the design and pricing requirements and make the overall decision regarding the use of our semiconductor product solutions in their products. The contract manufacturers and distributors place product purchase orders with us, take title to the products upon delivery and pay us directly for those purchases. The majority of these customers do not have return rights except under applicable warranty provisions.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our product solutions for incorporation into the products of our OEM customers. We generate sales through direct sales employees as well as outside sales representatives, distributors and value-added resellers. Our sales personnel receive substantial technical assistance and support from our internal technical marketing and engineering resources due to the highly technical nature of our product solutions. Sales frequently result from multi-level engagement that involve our senior management, design engineers and sales personnel interacting with our customers’ decision makers throughout the product development and order process.
See “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 18. Segment and Other Information” for additional information on revenue by geographic location and product category.
Manufacturing
We employ a fabless semiconductor manufacturing platform through third-party relationships. We currently utilize third-party semiconductor wafer manufacturers to supply silicon wafers integrating our proprietary design specifications. The completed silicon wafers are forwarded to third-party package and test processors for further processing into die and packaged ASICs, as applicable, which are then used in our custom module products or processed as our ASIC-based solutions.
After processing and testing, the die and ASICs are consigned to various contract manufacturers for assembly or shipped directly to our customers. During the assembly process, our die or ASIC is either combined with other components to complete the module for our custom product solutions or the ASIC is maintained as a standalone finished good. The finished assembled product is subsequently shipped directly to our customers or to our contract manufacturers for integration into their products.
We believe our third-party manufacturing strategy provides a scalable business model, enables us to concentrate on our core competencies of research and development, technological advances and product design and engineering and reduces our capital investment.
Our third-party contract manufacturers and semiconductor fabricators are predominately Asia-based organizations. We generally provide our contract manufacturers with six-month rolling forecasts of our production requirements. As a result of past supply constraints and capacity shortages affecting the global semiconductor industry, we entered into long-term capacity and pricing agreements with some suppliers. Our reliance on these parties exposes us to vulnerability owing to our dependence on a few sources of supply. In some cases, we have alternative sources of supply to mitigate supplier risk. We may establish relationships with other contract manufacturers in order to reduce our dependence on any single source of supply.
Periodically, we purchase inventory from our contract manufacturers when a customer delays its delivery schedule or cancels its order. In such circumstances, we consider a write-down to reduce the carrying value of the inventory purchased to its net realizable value. We charge write-downs to reduce the carrying value of obsolete, slow moving and non-usable inventory to its net realizable value and charge such write-downs to cost of revenue. We also record a liability and charge to cost of revenue the estimated losses on inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays or order cancellations. In addition, the impact of entering into long-term capacity agreements could create significant inventory write-down if the end customer demand substantially declines.

Our proprietary firmware and software, including source code, are protected by copyright laws and trade secret laws.
Our technology portfolio spans ICs, firmware, software and mechanical hardware. The combination of these technologies within our products, along with the complexity of customer-specific customizations and the length of design cycles, provides a further barrier to replication and unauthorized use.
While we rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, confidentiality agreements and other legal and contractual protections, no single measure offers complete assurance and these measures may provide only limited protection. Accordingly, we continuously evaluate our IP protections and practices to safeguard our innovation assets in a dynamic global environment.
Human Capital and Workforce Management
Our company has been built on the collective contributions from people of many countries, religions and ethnic backgrounds. People are our most critical asset and are the core component behind our success. We want to attract, develop and retain the world’s best talent. As of June 2025, we employed approximately 1,700 employees. Our workforce is distributed globally across 15 countries with 21% of our employees located in North America, 69% located in Asia Pacific and 10% located in Europe and the Middle East. We believe our company attributes differentiate us in the market and have resulted in a lower voluntary attrition rate relative to benchmark data and a higher retention rate in fiscal 2025. Our employee average tenure globally is approximately eight years.
Our Board of Directors and its committees provide oversight on certain workforce management matters including, among other aspects, leadership development, management depth and strength assessment, people engagement and inclusion, and our employee experience survey results. The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring our business risks and our company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee oversees our Corporate, Governance and Sustainability (“CGS”) strategy, including talent attraction, retention and inclusion and belonging. The Compensation Committee provides oversight of our overall compensation philosophy, policies and programs and assesses whether our compensation establishes appropriate incentives for executive officers and other employees.
Competitive Compensation and Benefits
We provide competitive benefits related to health, wellness, mental health and family resources designed to meet the needs of our diverse global workforce. We have a robust pay for performance philosophy and compensation framework to reward high performance. We align executive compensation with our corporate strategies, business objectives and the creation of long-term value for our stockholders without encouraging unnecessary or excessive risk-taking.

oard of Directors identified as female. We continue to invest in programs that foster a respectful, inclusive and collaborative work environment that reflect the diverse cultural backgrounds represented in our global offices.
Corporate Responsibility
We are committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and to maintaining the highest ethical standards in our business practices. We believe that sustainable operations and consistent attention to CGS priorities support long-term stockholder value and reinforce the resiliency of our business. Our Board of Directors and management team integrate CGS considerations into strategy, financial planning and risk management to promote transparency, accountability and informed decision-making.
As part of our environmental efforts, we have implemented company-wide initiatives to reduce our natural resource consumption, minimize waste, promote reuse and recycling and dispose of end-of-life products in an environmentally safe manner.
Within our supply chain, we have adopted a supplier and vendor code of conduct and require our business partners to comply with and support the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct. Our vendors and suppliers are also required to obtain and maintain all required health and safety permits, provide reasonable working and living conditions and implement incident management systems and emergency preparedness protocols.
Oversight of CGS matters is embedded at the Board level. The Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee has oversight of CGS strategy and receives regular reports from management on progress and performance. The Audit Committee oversees our broader business risks and our company’s Code of Conduct. Our Board of Directors receives periodic updates from Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee and management on our CGS performance.
