ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are party to various litigation matters and claims arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business.

PART II
ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
Market Information on Common Stock
Our common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (formerly the Nasdaq National Market) under the symbol “SYNA” since January 29, 2002. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our common stock.
Stockholders
As of August 12, 2025, there were approximately 110 holders of record of our common stock. The closing price of our common stock as quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market as of August 12, 2025, was $67.49.
Dividends
We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently plan to retain all earnings to finance the growth of our business, make debt payments or purchase shares under our common stock repurchase program. Payments of any cash dividends in the future will depend on our financial condition, operating results and capital requirements as well as other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.
Our Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our Senior Notes also place restrictions on the payment of any dividends. For a further description of the terms of the Credit Agreement and our Senior Notes indenture, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 8. Debt and Revolving Credit Facility.”
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
During fiscal year 2025, we conducted repurchases under our previously authorized stock repurchase programs. The most recent of these programs expired in July 2025. As a result, on August 5, 2025, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $150 million of our common stock. This program does not have an expiration date; however, the Board will periodically review the authorization to assess its continued appropriateness in light of the Company’s capital allocation priorities and market conditions. Repurchases may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and are intended to comply with Rule 10b‑18 under the Exchange Act.
The number of shares repurchased and the timing of repurchases depend on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities.
During the three-month period ended June 28, 2025, repurchases under the previously authorized stock repurchase programs were as follows:
Period
Total Number of Shares Purchased
Average Price Paid Per Share
Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs
Approximate Dollar Value of shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1)
March 30, 2025 - April 26, 2025

Share Performance Graph
This performance graph shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act or otherwise subject to the liability of that section. The performance graph will not be deemed incorporated by reference into any filing of our company under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act.
In fiscal 2025, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector Index (“PHLX”) was selected as the most appropriate comparator index for the Company based on the characteristics of its constituents. This will be the last year that we present the Nasdaq Composite Index in the performance graph.
We operate on a 52 or 53-week fiscal year which ends on the last Saturday in June. Accordingly, the last day of our fiscal year varies. For consistent presentation and comparison to the industry indices shown herein, we have calculated our stock performance graph assuming a June 30 year end. The following graph shows a five-year comparison of cumulative total return on our common stock, the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector Index, Nasdaq Composite Index and the Russell 2000 Index from June 30, 2020 through June 30, 2025. 
The graph assumes an investment of $100 on June 30, 2020. The calculations of cumulative stockholder return on the Nasdaq Composite Index, the Russell 2000 Index and the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index include the assumed reinvestment of any dividends. The calculation of cumulative stockholder return on our common stock does not include the assumed reinvestment of dividends because we did not pay any dividends during the measurement period. The historical performance shown is not necessarily indicative of future performance. The performance was plotted using the following data:
