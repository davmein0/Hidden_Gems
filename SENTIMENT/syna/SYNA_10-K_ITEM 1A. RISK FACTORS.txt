Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Introduction
In this section, we will discuss the results of our operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. Discussions of our fiscal 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between our fiscal 2024 and 2023 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Part II 
– 
Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations” in our fiscal 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 29, 2024.
Overview
We are a leading worldwide developer and fabless supplier of premium mixed signal semiconductor solutions. We develop solutions that integrate the audio, touch and vision interfaces with embedded processing capabilities that are paired with wireless connectivity. We believe our results to date reflect the combination of our customer focus and the strength of our intellectual property and our engineering know-how, which allow us to develop or engineer products and solutions that meet the demanding design specifications of our OEMs.
In fiscal 2025, we achieved revenue growth with net revenue increasing 12% to $1,074.3 million compared to $959.4 million in fiscal 2024. The growth was primarily driven by strong execution in our Core IoT product category. Net revenue from Core IoT of $272.4 million increased by 53% compared to $177.6 million a year ago. This growth was fueled primarily by strong demand for our wireless connectivity products and the inclusion of sales from our Broadcom transaction. Enterprise and Automotive net revenue of $610.1 million increased by 7% compared to $570.0 million a year ago. The net increase was primarily driven by growth across our enterprise product portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in automotive revenue due to softness in the automotive sector. Mobile net revenue of $191.8 million decreased by 9% compared to $211.8 million a year ago, primarily as a result of the end-of-life shipments to a large U.S. mobile customer.
During the year, we launched multiple products expanding our product portfolios and accelerated our position in Edge AI and wireless connectivity through partnerships and licensing transactions. We are collaborating with Google’s research team to build the next-generation platform for Edge AI devices. We executed an agreement with Broadcom in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 to acquire certain assets and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to Broadcom’s Wi-Fi technology. We acquired these set of assets in order to solidify our leadership position for end-to-end AI IoT connectivity. Acquiring these assets allows us to expand our portfolio of Wi-Fi 8 combination devices that include advanced Bluetooth features, additional Wi-Fi 7 combination devices, ultrawide band intellectual property (which we can integrate into future IoT devices) and combination front-end modules. This transaction expands our field of use, allowing all our Wi-Fi products to compete in AR/VR, Android smartphones and consumer audio markets and secures our wireless roadmap for the next five years. We introduced the S3930 touch controller, featuring multi-frequency-region parallel sensing and the industry’s smallest high-performance footprint. This innovation enables consistent, low-latency touch performance in ultra-thin, bendable devices. The new solution is more cost-effective for applications such as foldable phones and large screens.
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 totaled $391.5 million and $876.9 million, respectively. Our net total debt outstanding at the end of fiscal 2025 was $834.8 million compared to $972.9 million at the end of fiscal 2024. We repaid our $582.0 million Term Loan Facility through a combination of a $450.0 million convertible senior note offering and balance sheet cash. We executed a capped call transaction to mitigate dilution up to a stock price of $150.48.
During fiscal 2025, we returned $128.3 million to shareholders through repurchase of approximately 1.8 million shares. Our share repurchase program expired in July 2025 and a new repurchase program of $150.0 million was authorized thereafter, with no expiration date.

Trends and Uncertainties
Current Economic Conditions
As a majority of our sales and manufacturing occurs outside of the U.S., we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. In particular, a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from customers located in international markets, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, including China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, where many of our OEM customers and contract manufacturers are based. As a result, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, especially relative to the U.S. dollar, can materially impact our reported revenue and profitability. We continue to monitor changes in international trade policies, particularly increased tariffs and other barriers or restrictions between the United States and other countries, including China. Our current operations suggest limited tariff exposure given our current import and export practices. However, some of our customers and suppliers may be impacted by evolving tariff regimes depending on their own supply chain strategies and sourcing locations. We continue to monitor for any potential customer and supplier impacts, ranging from supply chain realignments to changes in end demand. While the broader implications of these activities remain uncertain, based on our current lead times and order activity, we are not seeing unusual activity that would suggest any acceleration or delays in orders due to tariffs that would be likely to impact our near-term financial performance. We will continue to assess the short-term and long-term effects of these international trade policies and restrictions on our financial and operational performance.

Fiscal 2025 Compared with Fiscal 2024
Net Revenue.
Net revenue was $1,074.3 million for fiscal 2025 compared with $959.4 million for fiscal 2024, an increase of $114.9 million, or 12.0%. Of this net revenue, $610.1 million, or 56.8%, was from Enterprise and Automotive product applications, $272.4 million, or 25.4%, was from the Core IoT product applications market and $191.8 million, or 17.8%, was from the Mobile product applications market. Revenue increased in most of our product applications in fiscal 2025. Net revenue from Enterprise and Automotive product applications increased as a result of an increase in units sold (which increased 10.4%) and an increase in average selling prices (which increased 2.4%) due to our product sales mix compared

to the same period a year ago. The increase in revenue from Enterprise and Automotive product applications was partially offset by a decrease of $30.0 million in revenue from the licensing of certain of our IP. The increase in net revenue from Core IoT product applications was driven by an increase in units sold (which increased 40.8%) and an increase in average selling prices (which increased 8.9%) due to our product sales mix compared to the same period a year ago, inclusive of the contribution from the Broadcom transaction. Net revenue from Mobile product applications decreased due to a decrease in units sold (which decreased 1.8%) and a decrease in average selling prices (which decreased 10.3%) as overall demand decreased for our products in the mobile market compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease in revenue from Mobile product applications was partially offset by an increase of $4.5 million in revenue from the licensing of certain of our IP.
Gross Margin.
Gross margin as a percentage of net revenue was 44.7% in fiscal 2025 compared with 45.8% in fiscal 2024. The decrease in gross margin was driven by an increase in amortization expense primarily related to the intangible assets we acquired from Broadcom and a decrease in revenue from the licensing of certain of our IP. For additional information, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 7. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets.”
Because we sell our technology solutions in designs that are generally unique or specific to an OEM customer’s application, gross margin varies on a product-by-product basis, making our cumulative gross margin a blend of our product specific designs. As a fabless manufacturer, our gross margin percentage is generally not materially impacted by our shipment volume. Under most circumstances, revenue from license-based arrangements is fully accretive to our gross margin.
Operating Expenses.
Research and Development Expenses.
 Research and development expenses increased $10.5 million, to $346.8 million, for fiscal 2025 compared with $336.3 million in fiscal 2024. The increase in research and development expenses primarily reflected a $19.8 million increase in variable compensation related to bonus accruals and a $7.9 million increase in stock-based compensation charges primarily driven by the charges related to the awards granted to the Broadcom employees we onboarded during the third quarter of fiscal 2025. These increases were partially offset by a $16.3 million decrease in payroll related costs primarily driven by the restructuring action we initiated in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $19.0 million, to $180.3 million, for fiscal 2025 compared with $161.3 million in fiscal 2024. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily reflected a $11.6 million increase in variable compensation related to bonus accruals, a $8.3 million increase in professional service fees primarily related to the Broadcom transaction we executed in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and the refinancing of our Term Loan Facility in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and a $4.5 million unfavorable impact from exchange rates on foreign currencies, partially offset by a $8.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation charges primarily related to an increase in net forfeitures from the departure of certain executive officers from the Company compared to fiscal 2024.
Acquired Intangibles Amortization.
 Acquired intangibles amortization reflects the amortization of intangibles acquired through recent acquisitions. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 7. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets.”
Intangible asset impairment charge. 
Intangible asset impairment reflects the impairment of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 7. Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets.”
Restructuring Costs.
 Restructuring costs primarily reflect employee severance costs and facilities consolidation costs related to the restructuring action we initiated in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. These headcount-related costs included personnel in operations, research and development and selling, general and administrative functions. Restructuring costs incurred in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 were $16.9 million and $10.5 million, respectively. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 19. Restructuring Activities.”
Non-Operating Income.
Interest and Other Income.
 Interest and other income decreased $15.4 million, to $26.9 million in fiscal 2025 compared with $42.3 million in fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by an overall decrease in our invested cash and cash equivalents of approximately $400.0 million.
Interest Expense
. Interest expense primarily includes interest on our debt and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs. Interest expense decreased by $25.5 million to $39.8 million during fiscal 2025 as compared to $65.3 million during 
25

fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by the early repayment of the Term Loan Facility in November 2024. During fiscal 2025 and 2024, the interest expense on the Term Loan Facility was $18.7 million and $46.1 million, respectively. The Term Loan Facility was repaid with the net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2031 Notes, which bears a significantly lower interest rate of 0.75%. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 8. Debt and Revolving Credit Facility.”
(Benefit)/Provision for Income Taxes. 
The (benefit)/provision for income taxes of $(65.7) million and $(250.2) million in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, represented estimated federal, foreign and state income taxes. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2025 diverged from the combined U.S. federal and state statutory tax rate primarily due to a one-time tax benefit related to a U.S. “check-the-box” election made for our Israel subsidiary, favorable tax effects from the U.S. inclusion of foreign income, foreign earnings taxed at lower rates and a tax benefit associated with the fiscal 2018 U.S. transition tax under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) resulting from a recent U.S. Tax Court decision in 
Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Commissioner
. These benefits were partially offset by non-deductible share-based compensation and limitation on the deductibility of a certain officer’s compensation. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 16. Income Taxes.”
On July 4, 2025, subsequent to the end of our fiscal 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was signed into law. This legislation includes a permanent extension and modification of certain provisions under the TCJA. We are in the process of evaluating the potential impact of the OBBBA on our financial statements for future periods.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our cash and cash equivalents were $391.5 million as of the end of fiscal 2025 compared with $876.9 million as of the end of fiscal 2024, a decrease of $485.4 million. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was driven by cash used in financing activities of $331.4 million related to full repayment of our Term Loan Facility and repurchases of our common stock, partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of the 2031 Notes (as defined below) and cash used in investing activities of $297.9 million primarily related to our asset purchase agreement with Broadcom.
We consider almost all earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as not indefinitely reinvested overseas and have made appropriate provisions for income or withholding taxes that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As of the end of fiscal 2025, $341.3 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the United States, we will be able to repatriate these funds without a material impact on our provision for income taxes.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities. 
Operating activities during fiscal 2025 generated $142.0 million compared with $135.9 million net cash generated in fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2025, net cash provided by operating activities was the primarily driven by our results of operations, adjusted for non-cash charges of $219.0 million, and net cash outflows of $29.2 million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The primary drivers of the change in operating assets and liabilities relate to a decrease in income taxes payable primarily related to net tax payments of approximately $43.3 million made to various tax jurisdictions and an increase in net inventory of $25.1 million, related to the availability of supply and the impact of variations between forecasted and actual demand, offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $12.3 million, primarily related to the timing of collections and billings, and an increase of $31.5 million in accrued compensation primarily related to the accrual of our annual bonus.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities.
 Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2025 was $297.9 million compared with cash used in investing activities of $157.7 million during fiscal 2024. Net cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2025 primarily consisted of $200.3 million we paid to acquire certain assets and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to Broadcom’s Wi-Fi technology and the purchase of $61.0 million in short-term investments.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities.
 Net cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2025 was $331.4 million compared with $25.1 million used in financing activities for fiscal 2024. Net cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2025 consisted of $583.5 million used to repay the remaining outstanding balance of our Term Loan Facility, $128.3 million used to repurchase our common stock, exclusive of excise taxes, and $49.9 million used for the payment of capped call transactions associated with our 2031 Notes, partially offset by $439.5 million in net proceeds from issuance of our 2031 Notes.
Liquidity
We have $350.0 million available under our revolving credit facility with a maturity date to be the earlier of November 2029 or three months prior to any maturity of our Senior Notes. No funds were drawn from this credit facility during fiscal 2025.

Our aggregate principal debt obligations were $850.0 million as of June 2025 and mature at various dates through December 2031. In connection with our issuance of the 2031 Notes, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2031 Notes, along with our cash on hand, to repay the outstanding balance of our Term Loan Facility.
See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 8. Debt and Revolving Credit Facility.”
Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments. 
For our operating lease obligations, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 9. Leases.” For our purchase obligations, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies.”
Working Capital Needs.
 We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, anticipated cash flows from operating activities and available credit under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements, including small tuck-in acquisitions, and our debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, costs associated with restructuring activities net of projected savings from those activities, costs related to protecting our intellectual property, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing of introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing, costs of maintaining sufficient space for our workforce, the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions, our common stock repurchase program and the amount and timing of our investments in, or acquisitions of, other technologies or companies. Further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms. If sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our future long-term working capital needs, take advantage of business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained.
The undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries are not currently required to meet our U.S. working capital and other cash requirements, but should we repatriate a portion of these earnings, we may be required to pay certain previously accrued state and foreign taxes, which would impact our cash flows.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments in applying our most critical accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements.
The SEC has defined critical accounting estimates as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require our most difficult, complex or subjective judgments or estimates. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, including those related to our revenue, inventory valuation, business combinations, goodwill and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the bases for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with our expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.
We believe the following critical accounting estimates are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.
Revenue recognition
We recognize revenue upon the transfer of control of goods to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive. Our pricing terms are negotiated independently with each customer on a stand-alone basis. In evaluating the transaction price, we assess whether it is subject to adjustment or refund, such as stock rotation rights, price protection or volume-based incentives, and we estimate the resulting variable consideration accordingly. Although such arrangements occur in limited circumstances, they require judgment to determine the net consideration to which we expect to be entitled. We estimate variable consideration based on the historical data and experience with returns, rebates and credits. We believe these amounts to be immaterial to total revenue and do not anticipate significant changes to our estimates. This estimate qualifies as a critical accounting estimate due to the subjective judgments required to assess 
27
Table

f 
Con
tents
variable consideration and the potential impact on revenue recognition timing and amount, even if the current magnitude of such estimates is limited.
Inventory Valuation
We value inventory at standard cost, adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost and estimated net realizable value using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. In determining excess or obsolescence reserves for our products, we consider assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products and changes in customer requirements. In determining the lower of cost and net realizable value of our inventories, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices.
We fully reserve for inventories and non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. We perform periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances and non-cancellable purchase orders to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. We also record a charge to cost of revenue for estimated losses for inventory we are obligated to purchase from our contract manufacturers when such losses become probable from customer delays, order cancellations or other factors.
The following factors influence our estimates: changes to, or cancellations of, customer orders, unexpected or sudden decline in demand, rapid product improvements, technological advances and termination or changes by our OEM customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions. Our reserves contain uncertainties because the calculation requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding historical experience, market conditions and technological obsolescence. Overall, our estimates of inventory carrying value adjustments have been materially consistent with actual results. Due to the subjective inputs and forward-looking assumptions, this estimate qualifies as a critical accounting estimate with potential impact on gross margin and inventory-related balances.
Business Combinations
Accounting for a business combination requires us to estimate the fair value of consideration paid and the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which involves a number of judgments, assumptions and estimates that could materially affect the amount and timing of costs recognized in subsequent periods. We typically obtain independent third-party valuation studies to assist us in determining fair values, including assistance in estimating future cash flows, discount rates and comparable market values. Items involving significant assumptions, estimates and judgments include the following:
•
Fair value of consideration paid or transferred and
•
Intangible assets, including valuation methodology such as the income approach that includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, estimates of future revenues and costs, discount and royalty rates.
We estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Due to the subjectivity and reliance on forward-looking inputs, these acquisition-related estimates qualify as critical accounting estimates.
Income Taxes
We estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax return and financial statement purposes. We recognize income taxes using an asset and liability approach. This approach requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred taxes is based on the provisions of enacted tax law and the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated.
Evaluating the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires judgment and analysis of all positive and negative evidence available, including recent earnings history and taxable income in recent years, reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies to determine whether all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Using available evidence and judgment, we establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. Valuation allowances have been provided primarily against state research and development credits and certain capital losses of foreign subsidiaries. A change in the assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets may materially impact our tax provision in the period in which a change of assessment occurs.

As a multinational corporation, we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions. The taxation of our business is subject to the application of various and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions. Our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses, tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, tax incentives, the availability of tax credits and loss carryforwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies, which includes our estimates of the fair value of our intellectual property. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation and the evolution of regulations, court rulings and tax audits. The material jurisdictions in which we are subject to potential examination by tax authorities throughout the world include Japan, Hong Kong, United Kingdom, Israel and the United States.
Due to the complexity of international tax laws, reliance on future projections and the significant level of judgment involved, income tax-related estimates qualify as critical accounting estimates and may impact our results of operations and financial position.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to certain market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include:
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Our total net revenue for fiscal 2025 and 2024 was denominated in U.S. dollars. Costs denominated in foreign currencies were approximately 17% of our total costs in fiscal 2025 and 2024.
We face the risk that our accounts payable and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies will increase if such foreign currencies strengthen quickly and significantly against the U.S. dollar. Approximately 3% and 5% of our accounts payable were denominated in foreign currencies as of June 2025 and June 2024, respectively.
To provide an assessment of the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our foreign currency exposures within revenue, cost and operating expenses, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that an adverse change in exchange rates would have on our financial statements. A hypothetical weighted-average change of 10% in currency exchange rates would have changed our operating income before taxes and our net income by approximately $20.0 million for fiscal 2025, assuming no offsetting hedge positions. However, this quantitative measure has inherent limitations. The sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that U.S. dollar and other exchange rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency.
Interest Rate Risk on Cash and Cash Equivalents
Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio consists of cash and cash equivalents (money market funds and short-term investments). Our primary aim with our investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs. Our cash equivalent investments have short-term maturity periods that mitigate the impact of market or interest rate risk.
Based on our results of operations for fiscal 2025, a hypothetical reduction in the interest rates on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of a hypothetical increase or decrease of 50 basis points in rates compared to rates at the end of fiscal 2025 would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in interest income of approximately $2.0 million.
Interest Rate Risk on Debt
As of June 2025, all of our outstanding long-term debt had fixed interest rates. Consequently, our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates on reported interest expense and corresponding cash flows is minimal.

Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Synaptics Incorporated and subsidiaries (the Company) as of June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three fiscal year period ended June 28, 2025, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 28, 2025, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 28, 2025 and June 29, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three fiscal year period ended June 28, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 28, 2025 based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
32
Table

Con
tents
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Valuation of inventories
As discussed in Note 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company held $139.5 million of inventories as of June 28, 2025 which are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The Company records a write-down for excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventories based on forecasts of future demand and market conditions.
We identified the valuation of inventories associated with excess, obsolete or unmarketable inventories as a critical audit matter. A higher degree of auditor judgment was required to evaluate the Company’s estimate of net realizable value for these inventories. Specifically, there is a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating the effect of any unexpected or sudden declines in market demand which may result from changes to or cancellations of customer orders, rapid product improvements or technological advances, due to the nature of the evidence available related to these factors.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s process to develop the estimated net realizable value of inventory. For a selection of inventory items, we assessed the Company’s assumptions by comparing them to historical activity and demand forecasts. As part of the procedure, we considered customer communications, as well as end user and third-party publications. For a sample of inventory items, we recalculated the required write-downs and compared this to the recorded amounts.
Evaluation of the fair value of certain assets acquired in a business combination
As discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company consummated a business combination for total consideration of $247.9 million during the year ended June 28, 2025. In connection with this business combination, the Company allocated the total estimated purchase consideration to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values. The Company recorded various assets, which included developed technologies, roadmap technologies, and customer contract and related relationships with acquisition-date fair values of $24.5 million, $96.8 million and $27.9 million, respectively.
We identified the evaluation of the fair values allocated to developed technologies, roadmap technologies, and customer contract and related relationships as a critical audit matter. As a risk assessment procedure to determine the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of these acquired assets, we performed sensitivity analyses over certain assumptions, individually and in the aggregate, which required a high degree of auditor judgment. Due to the measurement uncertainty associated with certain key assumptions, specialized skills and knowledge were required in the evaluation of the forecasted revenue and royalty rate assumptions for the developed technologies and roadmap technologies assets and the forecasted revenue assumption for the customer contract and related relationship asset.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s acquisition-date valuation processes, including controls related to the development of the key assumptions. We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s

forecasted revenue assumptions by comparing to historical actual results of the acquired assets and certain peer and market participant data. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:
•
evaluating certain peer group and market participant data used in the assessment of forecasted revenue by assessing the appropriateness of the guideline comparable companies and market participant data obtained by management.
•
assessing the reasonableness of royalty rate by comparing to observable market royalty rates and evaluating the nature of the technologies acquired.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)

Note 1. 
Description of Business
We are a leading worldwide developer and fabless supplier of premium mixed signal semiconductor solutions that enable people to engage with connected devices and data, creating exceptional experiences throughout the home, at work, in the car and on the go. We provide our customers with sensing, processing and connecting solutions, which represent the three foundational elements of the Internet of Things (“IoT”). We supply connectivity, sensors and AI-enhanced processor solutions to original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that design IoT products and devices for automobiles, enterprise workspace devices, virtual reality, smartphones, tablets and notebook computers.
Note 2. 
Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the last Saturday in June. The fiscal years presented in this report are the 52-week periods ended June 28, 2025 and June 24, 2023 and the 53-week period ended June 29, 2024. For simplicity, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been shown as ending on calendar quarter end dates as of and for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and include Synaptics Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and disclosures. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue, allowance for credit losses, cost of revenue, inventories, loss on purchase commitments, product warranty, accrued liabilities, share-based compensation costs, provision for income taxes, deferred income tax assets, valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, applicable laws and regulations and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the bases for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
Cash Equivalents
Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.
Short-Term Investments
Investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents, while all other investments are classified as short-term based on management’s intent and ability to use the funds in current operations. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method and are reflected as interest and other income in the accompany consolidated statements of operations.
We regularly review our investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indicators of possible impairment. Some of the factors we consider include, but are not limited to, the following: the length of time and extent to which a security’s fair value has been below its cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, the credit quality of the security’s issuer, the likelihood of recovery and our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in value.
Fair Value Measurements
We apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities that are required to be recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in 
40

SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and credit risk. The carrying amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements approximate the fair value for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to their short-term nature.
Intangible assets, property and equipment and goodwill are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis if impairment is indicated. The interest rate on our term loan is variable, which is subject to change from time-to-time to reflect a market interest rate. See “Note 6. Fair Value Measurements.”
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers. Substantially all of our revenue is generated from product sales. Generally, our revenue is recognized at a point in time, either upon shipment or delivery of the product, in accordance with customer terms and conditions. We account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs before the customer obtains control of the goods and classify shipping and handling costs as a cost of revenue. We account for the collection of transaction taxes on a net basis.
Substantially all payments from our customers are generally due within our standard contractual terms, which do not include a significant financing component.
Products
We transfer control and recognize revenue at a point in time when products are shipped to our customers, including OEMs and distributors, in accordance with the shipping terms of the sale. We recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services, net of accruals for estimated sales returns and rebates. Certain OEMs and distributors may be entitled to rights of return and rebates under OEM and distributor agreements. We estimate the amount of variable consideration under these arrangements based on the expected value to be provided to customers. When incentives, stock rotation rights, price protection, volume discounts or other price allowances are applicable, they are estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recognized. Our accrual for estimated returns is based on historical return rates and recorded as a reduction to revenue with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory expected to be returned.
Intellectual property licensing arrangements
Rights to our intellectual property (“IP”) are either sold or licensed to customers. Revenue recognition from the licensing of our IP is dependent on the nature and terms of each agreement. We recognize revenue from the licensing of our IP upon delivery of the IP if there are no substantive future obligations to perform under the arrangement. Sales-based or usage-based royalties from the license of IP are recognized at the latter of the period the sale or usage occurs or the satisfaction of performance obligations, if any, to which some or all of the sales-based or usage-based royalties have been allocated.
As of June 2025, we did 
not
 have any remaining unsatisfied performance obligations with an original duration greater than one year. Accordingly, under the optional exception provided by the applicable accounting standard, we have not disclosed revenues allocated to future performance obligations of partially completed contracts.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed when incurred.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We maintain allowances for expected credit losses resulting from the inability of customers to meet their financial obligations. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances in which we are aware of a specific customer’s potential inability to meet its financial obligation, we record a specific reserve of the estimated credit loss against amounts due. In addition, we make judgments and estimates on the collectability of accounts receivable based on our historical bad debt experience, customers’ creditworthiness, current economic trends, recent changes in customers’ payment trends and deterioration in customers’ operating results or financial position. If circumstances change adversely, additional credit loss allowances may be required. At both June 2025 and June 2024, the allowance for credit losses on our trade receivables was $
4.2
 million.
Cost of Revenue
Our cost of revenue includes the cost of products shipped to customers, which primarily includes the cost of products built to our specifications by our contract manufacturers, the cost of silicon wafers supplied by independent semiconductor wafer manufacturers and the related assembly, package and test costs of our products. Also included in our cost of revenue

are personnel and related costs, including share-based compensation for quality assurance and manufacturing support personnel; logistics costs; depreciation of equipment supporting manufacturing; amortization of acquired intangibles; fair value adjustments of inventory associated with acquired businesses; write-downs of inventory and losses on purchase obligations; and warranty costs.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. The carrying value of our inventories is reduced for any difference between costs and estimated net realizable value of total inventory that is determined to be excess, obsolete or unsellable inventory based on forecast of future demand and market conditions. Any adjustments to reduce the cost of inventories to their net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current period. Once inventory is written down, a new accounting cost basis is established and, accordingly, any associated reserve is not released until the inventory is sold or scrapped.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Foreign Currency
The U.S. dollar is our functional and reporting currency. We remeasure our monetary assets and liabilities not denominated in our functional currency into U.S. dollar equivalents at the rate of exchange in effect on the balance sheet date. We measure and record non-monetary balance sheet accounts at the historical rate in effect at the date of transaction. The effects of foreign currency remeasurement are reported in reported in current results of operations.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at any other time when events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The qualitative factors we assess include long-term prospects of our performance, share price trends and market capitalization and other Company-specific events. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that affect the accuracy of our assumptions, estimates and judgments.
If we determine that, as a result of the qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not (i.e., greater than 50% likelihood) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The fair value of each of our goodwill reporting units is generally estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies.
We performed the qualitative goodwill impairment test in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. Based on the impairment analysis performed in the fourth quarter of each year presented, no goodwill impairment was recognized.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets consist primarily of intangible assets purchased through acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from 
1
 to 
8
 years.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We evaluate long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. In such cases, we measure recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the use and eventual disposition of the asset.
42
Table of Contents
SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
We review the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment charge in an amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset.
Leases
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of minimum lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease ROU assets also include any initial direct costs and prepayments less lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. As our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date, including lease term, in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
We have elected, for all classes of underlying assets, not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of twelve months or less. Lease costs for short-term leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Share-Based Compensation
We recognize compensation expense for all of our share-based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values. The determination of fair value of restricted and certain performance stock awards is based on the fair value of our stock on the grant date with performance awards adjusted for the actual outcome of the underlying performance condition. For awards with market-based performance conditions, we employ a Monte Carlo simulation valuation method to calculate the fair value of the awards based on the most likely outcome. We estimate the grant-date fair value of stock to be issued under our Employee Stock Purchase plan (“ESPP”) using the Black-Scholes model. Compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the applicable award using the straight-line method, except for awards with market conditions, which are recognized ratably for each vesting tranche from the service inception date to the end of the requisite service period. Compensation cost for performance-based awards is recognized when it becomes probable that the performance conditions will be met. Forfeitures are recorded when they occur and previously recognized compensation expense is reversed for the portion of awards forfeited prior to the vesting date.
Income Taxes
We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period that includes the enactment date. We establish valuation allowances when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.
We use a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of highly complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We believe we have adequately provided for reasonably foreseeable outcomes in connection with the resolution of income tax uncertainties. However, our results have in the past, and could in the future, include favorable and unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period a determination of such estimated tax liability is made or resolved, upon the filing of an amended return, upon a change in facts, circumstances or interpretation or upon the expiration of a statute of limitation. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period.
Product Warranty
We generally provide warranties to cover defects in workmanship, materials and manufacturing for a period of twelve months to meet the stated functionality as agreed in each sales arrangement. Products are tested against specified functionality requirements prior to delivery, but we nevertheless from time to time experience claims under our warranty guarantees. These standard warranties are assurance type warranties and do not offer any services in addition to the 
43
Table of Contents
SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
assurance that the product will continue working as specified. Therefore, warranties are not considered separate performance obligations in the arrangement. We accrue for estimated warranty costs based upon historical experience, and for specific items, at the time their existence is known and the amounts are determinable.
Acquisitions
We account for business combinations by applying the acquisition method. If the assets acquired are not a business, we account for the transaction or other event as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, we recognize identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. We capitalize acquisition-related costs and fees associated with asset acquisitions and immediately expense acquisition-related costs and fees associated with business combinations.
We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired developed technology and discount rates. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ materially from estimates. Other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any adjustments from change in facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and that impact our preliminary estimates are recorded to goodwill if identified within the measurement period. Any adjustments subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of fair value of assets and liabilities are reported in current results of operations.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Accounting Pronouncements Adopted
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” We adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. See “Note 18. Segment and Other Information.”
Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” This ASU requires consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and disclosures of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. This ASU is effective for our fiscal year 2026. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement 
–
 Reporting Comprehensive Income 
–
 Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40).” This ASU requires companies to disclose additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to financial statements. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our disclosures.

Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions
Fiscal Year 2025 Acquisition
Broadcom Wi-Fi technology
On January 19, 2025, we entered into definitive asset purchase agreements with Broadcom to acquire certain assets, and obtain non-exclusive licenses relating to, Broadcom’s Wi-Fi Business in the IoT market for an aggregate consideration of $
200.3
 million in cash, which closed on January 30, 2025 (“Closing Date”). These assets include non-exclusive licenses to three developed technology products, property and equipment and right to obtain license of eight roadmap technology intangible assets expected to be delivered at various dates through September 2027. We also entered into transition agreements with Broadcom, under which both parties will provide one another with certain transition services (including one year inventory supply agreement in which Broadcom will facilitate Synaptics to place purchase orders with respective suppliers) following the Closing Date. We acquired these set of assets from Broadcom in order to solidify our leadership position for end-to-end AI IoT connectivity.
The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the business acquisition guidance. Under the purchase accounting method, the total estimated purchase consideration of the acquisition was allocated to the identifiable intangible assets acquired, property and equipment and long-term assets for roadmap IP based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the identifiable intangible assets acquired and long-term assets was recorded as goodwill.

We estimated the fair value of the identified intangible assets and long-term assets for roadmap IPs using a discounted cash flow model, estimates of future revenues and costs, discount and royalty rates for each of the underlying identified assets, except for in process research and development (“IPR&D”), which was estimated using replacement cost method. These fair value measurements were based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represented a Level 3 measurement. Key assumptions included the level and timing of expected future cash flows, conditions and demands specific to each asset over its remaining useful life and discount rates we believe to be consistent with the inherent risks associated with each type of asset, which ranges from 
5.8
% - 
10.5
%. The fair value of these assets is primarily affected by the projected revenue, gross margins, operating expenses, the expected technological obsolescence, probability of securing future customer contracts for next generation devices and the anticipated timing of the projected income associated with each asset coupled with the discount rates used to derive their estimated present values. We believe the level and timing of expected future cash flows appropriately reflects market participant assumptions.
Long-term assets for roadmap IPs represent a prepayment for eight technology products to be received in the future. This prepayment is classified under non-current other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Upon obtaining control of the developed technologies, the amounts recorded will be reclassified as intangible assets based on their respective fair values determined as of the Closing Date.
The following table summarizes the estimate of the intangible assets as of the Closing Date:

16.0
 million of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The consolidated financial statements include approximately $
47.7
 million of revenue from the Closing Date through June 2025. It is impracticable to determine the effect on net income attributable to the acquisition as we had integrated a substantial portion of the acquisition into our ongoing operations at the close.
We determined it is impractical to include pro forma information given the difficulty in obtaining the historical financial information for the acquisition as the business was part of Broadcom and did not have discrete financial information prior to the acquisition. Inclusion of such information would require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding the acquired business historical financial results that we believe may ultimately prove inaccurate.
Fiscal Year 2024 Asset Acquisition
During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we entered into an amendment to our wireless license agreement with Broadcom to license 
four
 developed technology products and to extend the exclusivity period of certain developed technologies that were previously licensed from Broadcom in July 2020 for an aggregate consideration of $
130.0
 million. As of June 2025, we have obtained control of 
three
 of the 
four
 technology products and the 
three-year
 extension period to exclusively license previously acquired developed technology intangible assets. Accordingly, the relative fair value of $
87.5
 million for those technology products is presented as acquired intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the remaining technology product of $
42.5
 million, for which we have not yet obtained control, is an advance payment on intangible assets and is presented within other long-term assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Note 6. 
Fair Value Measurements
We determine fair value based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value assumes that a transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability and establishes that the fair value of an asset or liability shall be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The classification of a financial asset or liability within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value
:
•
Level 1 – Valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
•
Level 2 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.
•
Level 3 – Valuation is based upon other unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurements.
Our Level 1 financial instruments are traded in active markets and the fair value is based on quoted market prices for identical instruments. The fair value of our Level 2 fixed-income securities is obtained from an independent pricing service, which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments or model-driven valuations using observable market data or inputs corroborated by observable market data. Our marketable securities are held by custodians who obtain investment prices from a third-party pricing provider that incorporates standard inputs in various asset price models.

Amortization expense is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangibles. IPR&D will be accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and will not be amortized until the underlying project reaches technological feasibility and commercial production, at which point the IPR&D will be amortized over the estimated useful life. Useful lives for these IPR&D projects are expected to range between 
3
 to 
10
 years. In the event the IPR&D is abandoned, the related assets will be written off. The total amortization expense for acquired intangible assets was $

Impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets
During fiscal 2025, we recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of $
13.8
 million related to a license of certain technology we acquired in fiscal 2024. We recorded the impairment charge due to a lack of potential customers, no alternative uses for the acquired technology and no further development or investment planned for this project. The impairment charge was presented as an operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations.
During fiscal 2024, we recorded an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge of $
16.0
 million of IPR&D from our December 2021 acquisition of DSP Group, Inc. (“DSPG”). We recorded the impairment charge as a result of a lack of commitment from certain key customers, no anticipated customer migration to the IPR&D technologies acquired from DSPG and no further development or investment planned for this project. The impairment charge was presented as an operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations.

2031 Convertible Senior Notes
On November 19, 2024 and November 26, 2024, we issued and sold $
400.0
 million and $
50.0
 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of 
0.75
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2031 (“2031 Notes”) in a private placement. The 2031 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (“2031 Indenture”), dated November 19, 2024. The 2031 Notes are unsecured, bear interest at a fixed rate of 
0.75
% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2025, and mature on December 1, 2031, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased by us.
The 2031 Notes are our senior, unsecured obligations and are (i) equal in right of payment with our existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to our existing and future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the 2031 Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to our existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities.

Table of Contents
SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
The initial conversion rate of the 2031 Notes is 10.0308 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of 2031 Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 
99.69
 per share). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the 2031 Indenture. In addition, upon the occurrence of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change or if we deliver a Redemption Notice, both as defined in the 2031 Indenture, we will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of common stock as described in the 2031 Indenture for a holder who elects to convert its 2031 Notes in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change or to convert its 2031 Notes called (or deemed called as provided in the 2031 Indenture) for redemption in connection with such Redemption Notice, as the case may be.
At any time from, and including, September 2, 2031, the 2031 Notes are convertible at the option of the holders thereof only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the first calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2025, if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) during the 
five
 consecutive business days after any 
ten
 consecutive trading day period (such 
ten
 consecutive trading day period, the “measurement period”) in which the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2031 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of our common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; (3) if we call such 2031 Notes for redemption; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events or distributions on our common stock, (as defined in the 2031 Indenture). As of June 2025, none of the conditions allowing holders of the 2031 Notes to convert had been met. On or after September 2, 2031 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the 2031 Notes, holders of the 2031 Notes may convert all or a portion of their 2031 Notes, regardless of the foregoing conditions. Upon conversion, the 2031 Notes will be settled in cash, shares of our common stock based on the conversion rate (as defined in the 2031 Indenture) or any combination thereof, at our election.
The 2031 Notes are redeemable, at our option at any time, and from time to time, on or after December 6, 2028. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2031 Notes (subject to the limitation described below), at our option, on or after December 6, 2028 and on or before the 40th scheduled trading day immediately before December 1, 2031 at a cash redemption price equal to the principal amount of the 2031 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, but only if (i) the notes are Freely Tradable (as defined in 2031 Indenture) as of the date we send the related redemption notice and all accrued and unpaid additional interest, if any, has been paid in full as of the most recent interest payment date occurring on or before the date we send such notice; and (ii) the last reported sale price per share of our common stock exceeds 
130
% of the conversion price on (1) each of at least 
20
 trading days, whether or not consecutive, during the 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the trading day immediately before the date we send such redemption notice; and (2) the trading day immediately before the date we send such notice. However, we may not redeem less than all of the outstanding notes unless at least $
100.0
 million aggregate principal amount of notes are outstanding and not called for redemption as of the time we send, and after giving effect to, the related redemption notice. In addition, calling any note for redemption will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change with respect to that note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of that note will be increased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption. No sinking fund is provided for the 2031 Notes.
Upon the occurrence of a Fundamental Change (as defined in the 2031 Indenture) prior to the maturity date of the 2031 Notes, holders of the 2031 Notes may require us to repurchase their notes for a cash repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the 2031 Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date (as defined in the 2031 Indenture).
2031 Capped Calls
In connection with the issuance of the 2031 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (each, a “2031 Capped Call” and collectively, the “2031 Capped Calls”) with certain financial institutions. The 2031 Capped Calls have an initial strike price of $
99.69
, subject to certain adjustments, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2031 convertible senior notes. The 2031 Capped Calls have an initial cap price of $
150.48
 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The 2031 Capped Calls are expected to partially offset the potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the 2031 convertible senior notes, with such offset subject to a cap based on the cap price. The 2031 Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 
4.5
 million shares of the Company’s common stock. The 2031 Capped Calls are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified extraordinary events affecting the Company, including merger events, tender offers and announcement events. For accounting purposes, each 2031 Capped Call is treated as a separate transaction from, and not part of, the terms of the 2031 convertible senior notes. As these 
51
Table of Contents
SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the 2031 Capped Calls are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The 2031 Capped Calls will not be remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification.
Contractual interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs on the 2031 Notes was $
2.1
 million and $
1.1
 million, respectively, in 2025.
Senior Notes
In March 2021, we issued $
400.0
 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due June 15, 2029 (“Senior Notes”), which bear interest at a rate of 
4.0
% payable semi-annually on December 15 and June 15 of each year. The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by each of our current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior secured credit facilities.
The indenture to the Senior Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and the ability of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the indenture) to (i) incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness; (ii) pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our company’s or any parent’s capital stock; (iii) prepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; (iv) issue certain preferred stock or similar equity securities; (v) make loans and investments; (vi) dispose of assets; (vii) incur liens; (viii) enter into transactions with affiliates; (ix) enter into agreements restricting its subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and (x) consolidate, merge or sell all, or substantially all, of its assets.
The indenture contains customary events of default. An event of default under the indenture will allow either the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes to accelerate, or in certain cases automatically cause the acceleration of, the maturity of the principal and accrued interest on all outstanding Senior Notes.
We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at a price of 
101
% of the principal amount in 2025 and at 
100
% of the principal amount in 2026 and thereafter.

SYNAPTICS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
The Revolving Credit Facility bears interest, at our election, at a Base Rate plus an Applicable Margin or Adjusted Term SOFR, as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility agreement. We are required to pay a commitment fee on any unused commitments which is determined on a leverage-based sliding scale ranging from 
0.175
% to 
0.25
% per annum. The unused commitment fees on the Revolving Credit Facility were $
0.4
 million in 2025 and $

The Revolving Credit Facility contains various restrictive covenants, including 
two
 financial covenants which limit the consolidated total net leverage ratio and the consolidated net interest coverage ratio. As of June 2025, we remain in compliance with the restrictive covenants.

Concentrations of Credit Risk and Significant Customers
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. Our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are maintained with high-quality financial institutions.
We believe that the concentration of credit risk in our accounts receivable is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process, relatively short collection terms and the level of credit worthiness of our customers. We extend credit based on an evaluation of a customer’s financial condition and generally do not require collateral. We perform ongoing credit evaluations on our customers and limit the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary based upon payment history and current credit worthiness. We regularly review the allowance for credit losses by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, age of accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may negatively impact our customers’ ability to pay.
At June 2025 and June 2024, three customers comprised a total of 
45
% and 
42
% our accounts receivable, respectively.

Indemnifications
In connection with certain agreements, we are obligated to indemnify the counterparty against third party claims alleging infringement of certain intellectual property rights. We have in the past, and may in the future, receive notices from third parties that claim our products infringe their intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our technologies and products do not, and will not, infringe issued patents or other proprietary rights of third parties. Any infringement claims, with or without merit, could result in significant litigation costs and diversion of management and financial resources, including the payment of damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We accrue for liabilities arising from indemnifications when it is both probable that we will incur the loss and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss.
We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors. Maximum potential future payments under these agreements cannot be estimated because these agreements generally do not have a maximum stated liability. However, historical costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant.
Environmental Matters
In connection with our acquisition of Conexant Systems, LLC (“Conexant”) in fiscal 2018, we agreed to assume certain environmental liabilities, including remediation of environmental impacts at a property formerly owned by Conexant (“Conexant Site”). We continue to incur costs to investigate and remediate the Conexant Site’s environmental impacts. The liabilities are reviewed periodically and, as investigation and remediation activities continue, adjustments are made as necessary. Liabilities for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value. We believe that the outcome of this matter should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or operating results.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we are subject to various claims and legal proceedings, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. We accrue for loss contingencies when it is both probable that we will incur the loss and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or range of loss. While we currently believe that resolving claims against us, 
55

individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and our view of these matters may change in the future.
Note 13. 
Stockholders’ Equity
Preferred Stock
We are authorized, subject to limitations imposed by Delaware law, to issue up to 
10,000,000
 shares of preferred stock in one or more series without stockholder approval. Our Board of Directors has the authority to establish, from time-to-time, the number of shares to be included in each series and to fix the rights, preferences and privileges of the shares of each wholly unissued series and any of its qualifications, limitations or restrictions. Our Board of Directors can also increase or decrease the number of shares of a series, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by the stockholders. As of the end of fiscal 2025, there were 
no
 shares of preferred stock outstanding.
Shares Reserved for Future Issuance
As of the end of fiscal 2025, shares of common stock reserved for future issuance was as follows:

Common Stock Repurchase Program
From April 2005, our Board of Directors authorized a series of stock repurchase programs under which we repurchased shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending upon market conditions and other factors. These historical programs cumulatively authorized the repurchase of up to $
2.3
 billion of our common stock. The most recent of these programs expired in July 2025. As a result, on August 5, 2025, the Board authorized a new stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $
150
 million of our common stock. This program does not have an expiration date; however, the Board will periodically review the authorization to assess its continued appropriateness in light of the Company’s capital allocation priorities and market conditions. Repurchases under the program may be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and are intended to comply with Rule 10b‑18 under the Exchange Act.
The number of shares repurchased and the timing of repurchases depend on the level of our cash balances, general business and market conditions and other factors, including alternative investment opportunities.
In fiscal year 2025 and 2023, we repurchased 
1.8
 million shares of our common stock for $
128.3
 million and 
2.0
 million shares for $
183.5
 million, respectively. We did 
not
 repurchase any of our common stock in fiscal 2024. All repurchased shares are recorded as treasury stock.
Note 14. 
Share-Based Compensation
Share-Based Compensation Plans
As of the end of fiscal 2025, we had the following equity compensation plans under which equity securities were authorized for issuance to our employees and directors:
2025 Inducement Equity Plan
Effective January 27, 2025, we adopted the 2025 Inducement Equity Plan (“2025 Inducement Plan”) which provides for the issuance of option or appreciation rights, restricted stock units (“RSU”) or dividend equivalents to our employees. Awards granted under the 2025 Inducement Plan will not exceed 
1,700,000
 shares of common stock. As of June 2025, 
693,494
 shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2025 Inducement Plan. Equity awards granted under the 2025 Inducement Plan generally vest ratably over 
two years
 from the vesting commencement date.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Amended and Restated 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan
Our Synaptics Incorporated Amended and Restated 2019 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (“2019 Incentive Plan”) provides for the grant of equity-based compensation in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, cash incentive awards, shares with performance conditions (“PSU”) or market-based conditions (“MSU”) and other stock-based awards. As of June 2025, 
2,675,325
 shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2019 Incentive Plan. The performance metrics of PSU and MSU awards can be financial performance and/or market-based conditions. Each PSU and MSU award reflects a target number of shares that may be issued to an award recipient before adjusting based on our financial performance and/or market-based conditions. The actual number of shares that an award recipient receives at the end of the period may range from 
0
% to 
300
% of the target number of shares granted, depending upon the achievement of the performance target designated by each individual award.
Our 2025 Inducement Plan and 2019 Incentive Plan are collectively referred to as “Stock Compensation Plans.”

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Our employee stock purchase plan (“2019 ESPP”) allows employees to designate up to 
15
% of their base compensation, subject to legal restrictions and limitations, to purchase shares of common stock at 
85
% of the lesser of the fair market value at the beginning of the offering period or the exercise date. Under the 2019 ESPP, the offering period extends for up to 
one year
 and includes 
two
 exercise dates occurring at 
six-month
 intervals. Under the terms of our 2019 ESPP, if the fair market value at an exercise date is less than the fair market value at the beginning of the offering period, the current offering period will terminate and a new offering period will commence. As of June 2025, 
449,103
 shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance under the 2019 ESPP Plan.

Realization of deferred tax assets depends on our generating sufficient U.S. and certain foreign taxable income in future years to obtain a benefit from the utilization of those deferred tax assets on our tax returns. Accordingly, the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable may increase or decrease when we reevaluate the underlying basis for our estimates of future U.S. and foreign taxable income. As of the end of fiscal 2025, a valuation allowance of $
94.8
 million was maintained to reduce the deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryovers in a foreign jurisdiction and all deferred tax assets in California to levels we believe are more likely than not to be realized through future taxable income. The net change in the valuation allowance during fiscal 2025 was an increase of $
2.4
 million.
We consider almost all earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as not indefinitely reinvested overseas and have made appropriate provisions for income or withholding taxes that may result from a future repatriation of those earnings. As a result, an immaterial deferred tax liability is associated with unremitted foreign earnings, the remittance of which would not result in a further provision for income taxes. We continue to indefinitely reinvest $
200.0
 million on certain accumulated earnings and outside basis differences primarily related to our DSPG acquisition. If the undistributed earnings and other outside basis differences were recognized in a taxable transaction, the associated foreign tax credits would be expected to reduce the U.S. income tax liability associated with the foreign distribution or the otherwise taxable transaction. As of our fiscal 2025, assuming full utilization of the associated foreign tax credits, the potential net deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and outside basis differences would be approximately $
46.0
 million.
As of the end of fiscal 2025, we had federal, California and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $
11.3
 million, $
31.0
 million and $
87.9
 million, respectively. The federal net operating loss can be carried forward indefinitely and the California net operating loss will begin to expire in fiscal 2027, respectively if not utilized. Most of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration date. Under current tax law, net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are available to offset future income or income taxes, if utilized before expiration. However, the use of these carryforwards may be limited by statute or upon the occurrence of certain events, including significant changes in ownership.

4.2
 million and $
3.6
 million as of the end of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively. Our policy is to classify interest and penalties, if any, as components of income tax expense.
It is reasonably possible that the amount of liability for unrecognized tax benefits may change within the next 12 months; an estimate of the range of possible changes could result in a decrease of $
3.3
 million to an increase of $
1.9
 million. Any prospective adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits will be recorded as an increase or decrease to income tax expense and cause a corresponding change to our effective tax rate. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could fluctuate materially from period to period.
Our major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Hong Kong SAR, Japan, Israel and the U.K. From fiscal 2017 onward, we remain subject to examination by one or more of these jurisdictions.
On July 4, 2025, subsequent to the end of our fiscal year ended June 28, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (“OBBBA”) was signed into law. This legislation includes a permanent extension and modification of certain provisions under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“TCJA”) and contains multiple effective dates. As the enactment occurred subsequent to our fiscal 2025, the impacts of the provisions of the OBBBA are not reflected in our fiscal 2025 financial statements. Certain provisions are effective beginning in fiscal 2026, and we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the new legislation on our future financial statements.

Segment and Other Information
Segment reporting
We operate in 
one
 segment — the development, marketing and sale of semiconductor products used in electronic devices and products. This determination is based on the management approach, which designates internal information regularly available to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of determination of our reportable segment. Our CODM,

the Chief Executive Officer, reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for the purpose of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.
The CODM uses consolidated net income, as reported in our consolidated statements of operations, as the measure of profit or loss to allocate resources and assess performance. Financial forecasts and budget-to-actual results used by the CODM to assess performance and allocate resources, as well as those used for strategic decisions related to headcount and capital expenditures, are also reviewed on a consolidated basis. The CODM considers the impact of the significant segment expenses in the tables below when deciding whether to reinvest profits or pursue strategic mergers and acquisitions.

Fiscal 2025 Restructuring Plan
A restructuring plan was initiated during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (“Fiscal 2025 Restructuring Plan”) primarily intended to focus on key growth initiatives, reduce costs and align our business in response to market conditions. Under the Fiscal 2025 Restructuring Plan, we will early terminate office space under operating leases. During fiscal 2025, we recorded restructuring charges of $
16.4

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Conclusions Regarding Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of June 28, 2025, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for our company. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in the 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO 2013 framework).
Based on our evaluation under the COSO 2013 framework, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of June 28, 2025. KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and as part of its audit has issued an attestation report, included herein, on our internal control over financial reporting, as of June 28, 2025.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, misstatements, errors and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been or will be prevented or detected. Further, internal controls may become inadequate as a result of changes in conditions or through the deterioration of the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION
