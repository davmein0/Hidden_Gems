Flight Equipment
As of December 31, 2024, American operated a mainline fleet of 977 aircraft. During 2024, American accepted delivery of 12 mainline aircraft including seven Boeing 737-8 MAX and five Airbus A321neo. We are supported by our wholly-owned and third-party regional carriers that fly under capacity purchase agreements operating as American Eagle. As of December 31, 2024, American Eagle operated 585 regional aircraft. During 2024, we increased our regional fleet by 29 aircraft, including the addition of 32 regional aircraft and net of 27 regional aircraft returned to service from temporary storage, offset by the return of 30 regional aircraft to third-party regional carriers. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we decided to permanently park 43 Embraer 145 aircraft that were previously being held in temporary storage.

Delivery schedule represents our best estimate as of the date of this report as described in footnote (e) to the “
Contractual Obligations
” table in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Actual delivery dates are subject to change, which could be material, based on various potential factors including production delays by the manufacturer and regulatory concerns.
In addition, we have committed to purchase 12 used Bombardier CRJ 900 aircraft which are scheduled to be delivered from 2025 through 2026. We also have agreements for 52 spare engines to be delivered in 2025 and beyond.
We intend to finance future aircraft deliveries and option exercises using long-term debt. See Note 11 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 10 to American’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information on aircraft and engine acquisition commitments.
Ground Properties
At each airport where we conduct flight operations, we have agreements, generally with a governmental unit or authority, for the use of passenger, operations and baggage handling space as well as runways and taxiways. These agreements, particularly in the U.S., often contain provisions for periodic adjustments to rates and charges applicable under such agreements. These rates and charges also vary with our level of operations and the operations of the airport. Additionally, at our hub locations and in certain other cities we serve, we lease administrative offices, catering, cargo, training, maintenance and other facilities.
We lease or have built on leased property our headquarters and training facilities in Fort Worth, Texas, our principal overhaul and maintenance base in Tulsa, Oklahoma, our regional reservation offices, and administrative offices throughout the U.S. and abroad.
