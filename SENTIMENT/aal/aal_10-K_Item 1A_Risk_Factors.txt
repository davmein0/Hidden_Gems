Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
We sometimes use financial measures that are derived from the consolidated financial statements but that are not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) to understand and evaluate our current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures may also provide useful information to investors and others. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP measures of other companies, and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any measure of performance, cash flow or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP. We are providing a reconciliation of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable financial measures on a GAAP basis.

Table of Contents
The following table presents the components of our total net special items and the reconciliation of pre-tax income and net income (GAAP measures) to pre-tax income excluding net special items and net income excluding net special items (non-GAAP measures). Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our current operating performance and to allow for period-to-period comparisons. As net special items may vary from period-to-period in nature and amount, the adjustment to exclude net special items allows management an additional tool to understand our core operating performance.

We retired our Airbus A330 fleet in 2020 as a result of the decline in demand for air travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2022, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge to write down the carrying value of our retired Airbus A330 fleet to their then estimated fair value due to the market conditions for certain used aircraft, and in 2024, we entered into a sales agreement for our remaining Airbus A330 aircraft, resulting in a $42 million gain.

Additionally, the table below presents the reconciliation of total operating costs (GAAP measure) to total operating costs excluding net special items and fuel (non-GAAP measure) and total operating cost per available seat mile (CASM) to CASM excluding net special items and fuel. Management uses total operating costs excluding net special items and fuel and CASM excluding net special items and fuel to evaluate our current operating performance and for period-to-period comparisons. The price of fuel, over which we have no control, impacts the comparability of period-to-period financial performance. The adjustment to exclude net special items and fuel allows management an additional tool to understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and core operating performance. Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.

See Part II, Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data – 
“Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures”
 and Note 2 to AAG’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for details on the components of pre-tax net special items.
Pre-Tax Income and Net Income
Pre-tax income and net income were $1.2 billion and $846 million, respectively, in 2024. This compares to 2023 pre-tax income and net income of $1.1 billion and $822 million, respectively.
Pre-tax income on a GAAP basis increased slightly in 2024 as compared to 2023. This was driven primarily by increases in passenger revenue, lower costs for aircraft fuel and related taxes and decreases in pre-tax net special items, offset in part by increases in certain operating expenses including salaries, wages and benefits, maintenance, materials and repairs and certain other operating expenses.
Excluding the effects of pre-tax net special items, pre-tax income was $1.8 billion and $2.5 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in our pre-tax income excluding pre-tax net special items was principally driven by certain operating expenses as mentioned above, offset in part by increases in passenger revenue and lower costs for aircraft fuel and related taxes.
In September 2024, American and the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, the union representing our mainline flight attendants, ratified a new collective bargaining agreement. This five-year agreement provides wage rate increases, quality-of-life benefits and other benefit-related items. The ratified agreement also included a provision for a one-time payment. In 2024, one-time charges resulting from the ratification of this new agreement were recorded as mainline operating special items, net in the consolidated statement of operations, including the one-time payment of $514 million which was paid in November 2024.

Table of Contents
Revenue
In 2024, we reported total operating revenues of $54.2 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 2.7%, as compared to 2023. Passenger revenue was $49.6 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 2.2%, as compared to 2023. In 2024, revenue passenger miles (RPMs) increased 7.3%, resulting in a load factor of 84.9% as compared to 83.5% in 2023. Passenger yield decreased 4.7% on 5.5% capacity growth year-over-year, as measured by available seat miles (ASMs). Our passenger revenue in 2024 was impacted by certain commercial initiatives we had previously deployed, along with an over-supply of industry capacity in the first half of the year. Mid-year, we took actions to adjust our strategy as well as capacity growth which, combined with industry capacity deceleration, resulted in sequential year-over-year improvement in passenger unit revenue performance in the third and fourth quarters of 2024.
Cargo revenue decreased $8 million, or 0.9%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to an 11.8% decrease in cargo yield driven by increased air freight capacity, offset in part by a 12.3% increase in cargo ton miles.
Other operating revenue increased $357 million, or 10.3%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, driven primarily by higher revenue associated with our loyalty program. During 2024 and 2023, cash payments from co-branded credit card and other partners were $6.1 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Cash remuneration in 2024 included a one-time cash payment related to the new co-branded credit card agreement announced in December 2024. This one-time cash payment will be amortized over the life of the new agreement beginning in 2026.
Our total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) was 18.51 cents in 2024, a 2.6% decrease as compared to 19.01 cents in 2023.
Fuel
In 2024, aircraft fuel expense totaled $11.4 billion, a decrease of $839 million, or 6.8%, as compared to 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by a 12.2% decrease in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel including related taxes to $2.60 in 2024 from $2.96 in 2023, offset in part by a 6.1% increase in gallons of fuel consumed due to increased capacity.
As of December 31, 2024, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review this policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. See Part I,
