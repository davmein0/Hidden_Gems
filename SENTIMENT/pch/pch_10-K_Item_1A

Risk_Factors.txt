 and 
Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
 contained in this report. This section generally discusses the results of operations for 2024 compared to 2023. For a discussion comparing our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources for the year ended December 31, 2023 to 2022, refer to this same section (Part II, Item 7) in our 2023 annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on February 15, 2024.
Our Company
We are a leading timberland REIT with ownership of 2.1 million acres of timberland. We also own six sawmills and an industrial grade plywood mill, a residential and commercial real estate development business and a rural timberland sales program. Our operations are organized into three business segments: Timberlands, Wood Products and Real Estate. Our Timberlands segment supplies our Wood Products segment with a portion of its wood fiber needs. These intersegment revenues are based on prevailing market prices and represent a significant portion of the Timberlands segment’s total revenues. Our other segments generally do not generate intersegment revenues. In the discussion of our consolidated results of operations, our revenues and expenses are reported after elimination of intersegment revenues and expenses. In the 
Business Segment Results
 discussion below, each segment’s revenues and expenses, as applicable, are presented before elimination of intersegment revenues and expenses.
Our business segments have been and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors, including tariffs, quotas and trade agreements, changes in timber prices and in harvest levels from our timberlands, competition, timberland valuations, demand for our non-strategic timberland for higher and better use purposes, lumber prices, weather conditions, disruptions or inefficiencies in our supply chain including the availability of transportation, the efficiency and level of capacity utilization of our Wood Products manufacturing operations, changes in our principal expenses such as log costs, inflation, asset dispositions or acquisitions, impact of pandemics, fires at our Wood Product facilities or on our timberlands, other natural disasters, government regulation and enforcement actions, and other factors.

Additionally, governments and businesses across the globe are taking action on climate change and are making significant commitments towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. Achieving these commitments will require governments and companies to take major steps to modify operations, invest in low-carbon activities and purchase offsets to reduce environmental impacts. We believe we are well positioned to provide products and services that entities may utilize to achieve these commitments through natural climate solutions, including selling or leasing timberlands to third parties for renewable energy projects such as for solar power generation facilities, selling pulpwood and sawmill residuals for green energy production, forest carbon offsets, carbon capture and storage projects, and other emerging technologies that allow wood fiber to be used in applications ranging from biofuels to bioplastics.
Non-GAAP Measures
To supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we present certain non-GAAP measures on a consolidated basis, including Total Adjusted EBITDDA and Cash Available for Distribution (CAD), which are defined and further explained and reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the 
Liquidity and Performance Measures
 section below. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered only as supplemental to, and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our definitions of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to potential inconsistencies in methods of calculation.

Business and Economic Conditions Affecting Our Operations

The demand for timber is directly affected by the underlying demand for lumber and other wood products, as well as by the demand for pulp, paper and packaging. Our Timberlands and Wood Products segments are impacted by both demand for new homes and home improvement and repair of existing homes in the United States. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, our Idaho log market is typically in balance but can be tensioned from time to time, while Southern log markets have more available supply. However, additional mill capacity being added in the U.S. South has led to tightening of markets in certain geographies.
Rural real estate dispositions and acquisitions can also be adversely affected when access to any properties to be sold or considered for acquisition is limited due to adverse weather conditions. Development real estate sales occur throughout the year and are dependent upon when our development of residential neighborhoods and commercial lots are substantially completed. The timing of these sales can also be impacted by contractor availability to complete the necessary infrastructure and other improvements.

The operating results of our Timberlands, Wood Products and Real Estate business segments have been and will continue to be affected by the cyclical nature of the forest products industry and the real estate industry. Log and pulpwood sales volumes in our Timberlands segment are typically lower in the first half of each year as winter rains in the Southern region and spring thaw in the Northern region limit timber harvesting operations due to softened roadbeds and wet logging conditions that restrict access to logging sites. The third quarter is typically our Timberlands segment's strongest production quarter. Demand for our manufactured wood products typically decreases in the winter months when construction activity is slower, while demand typically increases during the spring, summer and fall when construction activity is generally higher.
Interest rates affect our business primarily through their impact on mortgage rates, the broader U.S. economy, and our capital allocation strategies. Although mortgage rates are not directly set by the U.S. Federal Reserve, they tend to follow the movement of 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds, which are influenced by investor expectations regarding future Federal Reserve monetary policy. Data from Freddie Mac shows that from the end of 2011 to the end of 2021, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate remained below 4.0%. However, it began rising in the first quarter of 2022, peaking at around 7.8% in October 2023. The Federal Reserve reduced key benchmark interest rates by 100 basis points between late September and December 2024. Despite this, stronger-than-expected economic growth and uncertainties around long-term inflation and the U.S. deficit have kept mortgage rates elevated, ending 2024 at approximately 6.85%. Factors such as inflation, unemployment, and the overall economic climate can influence the Federal Reserve's decisions regarding short-term borrowing rates.
Single-family housing supply remains below the historical average, with affordability continuing to hinder home ownership. In January 2025, the U.S. Census Bureau reported 1.5 million total housing starts in December 2024 on a seasonally-adjusted basis, nearly 16% higher than November and the highest rate since February 2024. While the increase was largely driven by multi-family units, single-family housing starts averaged about 1.0 million units on a seasonally-adjusted annual basis in the fourth quarter of 2024, a 3.3% increase from the third quarter of 2024. Additionally, authorized building permits for single-family homes averaged nearly 980,000 units on a seasonally-adjusted annual basis during the fourth quarter of 2024, consistent with the 2024 annual average.
The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) reported that builder confidence for newly constructed single-family homes rose to 47 in January 2025, up from a low during 2024 of 39 in August. Despite the increase in confidence, builders continue to face challenges, including elevated mortgage rates, concerns over inflation, government regulation, and persistent supply-side issues such as a shortage of buildable lots, skilled labor, and rising material costs. These factors are driving up the cost of home construction. Nonetheless, we remain optimistic about the long-term outlook for housing, as the market continues to grapple with an undersupply of homes, historically low inventory levels, and a large millennial demographic entering their prime home-buying years.
The repair and remodel sector is the largest market segment for lumber demand. Near term headwinds on the repair and remodel market appear to have been driven by elevated interest rates, which raise the cost of discretionary projects, coupled with the low turnover of existing homes, which typically spurs repair and remodel activity. While spending on residential home remodeling moderated during 2024, the sector is expected to grow at a mild pace throughout 2025. We believe long-term favorable underlying fundamentals, including a strong labor market, solid household balance sheets, strong levels of home equity, an aging existing housing stock, and expected increases in sales of existing homes will support repair and remodel demand for our products.

Table of Contents

In our Timberlands segment, a significant portion of our Idaho sawlog prices are indexed on a four-week lag to lumber prices. The Northern region experienced a decrease in sawlog prices during 2024 because of lower indexed lumber prices compared to the prior year. In the Southern region, sawlog and pulpwood prices have been relatively stable year over year. Our total harvest volume in 2024 was 7.6 million tons and we expect to harvest approximately 7.4 million tons during 2025, with approximately 80% of the volume in the Southern region.

During the third quarter of 2024, we completed the construction phase of the expansion and modernization of our Waldo, Arkansas sawmill (the Waldo Modernization Project). The Waldo Modernization Project included upgrades to the log yard and planer, a new saw line, and a new continuous dry kiln and is expected to increase the sawmill’s annual capacity and reduce its operating costs significantly. The sawmill, which continued to operate during the construction, took limited downtime early in the third quarter to tie in the new equipment and restarted in mid-August 2024. We anticipate the sawmill will reach its expected new annual capacity run rate of 275 million board feet per year by mid-year of 2025.
During 2024, our Wood Products segment was challenged by a relatively weak lumber pricing environment which only began to improve towards the latter half of the year. Despite the pricing challenges, we shipped just over 1.1 billion board feet of lumber during 2024. For 2025, we expect to ship approximately 1.2 billion board feet of lumber, which takes into account the expected production ramp-up at the Waldo sawmill.
Our Real Estate segment benefited from increased rural land sales, including the sale of 34,100 acres of four-year average age Southern timberlands for $56.7 million to Forest Investment Associates (FIA), and higher average sales price per residential lot sold in Chenal Valley. We expect to sell approximately 26,000 rural acres and 130 residential lots in Chenal Valley during 2025.

2024 compared with 2023
Revenues
Revenues of $1.1 billion were $38.0 million higher compared to 2023 primarily due to increased rural real estate acres sold, including a 34,100-acre rural timberland sale for $56.7 million, and real estate development sales due to a higher average residential price per lot in Chenal Valley. These increases were partially offset by lower lumber and plywood prices, and lower Northern sawlog volume and prices.
Cost of goods sold
Cost of goods sold increased $46.1 million compared to 2023 primarily due to increased rural real estate acres sold and increased employee related costs. These increases were partially offset by lower raw material costs and lower logging and hauling costs on reduced rates in the Northern region.

35

Table of Contents

Selling, general and administrative expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $7.5 million compared to 2023 primarily due to higher professional service fees, including costs for implementation of new systems, and employee related costs. The prior year included a $1.0 million reduction in stock compensation expense due to employee forfeiture of stock awards.
Gain on fire damage
During 2023, we recognized insurance recoveries of $39.4 million for fire damage at our Ola, Arkansas sawmill. The claim with insurance carriers was finalized by the end of 2023.
Interest expense, net

Interest expense, net increased $4.7 million compared to 2023 primarily due to less interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents held in interest bearing accounts.
Income taxes

Income taxes are primarily due to income from our TRS. For 2024, we recorded an income tax benefit of $13.7 million on TRS pre-tax loss of $54.9 million as compared to an income tax benefit of $0.2 million on TRS pre-tax income of $15.4 million in 2023. The increase in our income tax benefit in 2024 was due to lower lumber prices reducing the pre-tax income generated by our TRS, both overall and relative to pre-tax income generated by our REIT, and changes in our unrecognized tax positions, primarily due to the lapse of the statute of limitations.

Total Adjusted EBITDDA
Total Adjusted EBITDDA for 2024 increased $31.9 million compared to 2023, primarily due to increased rural real estate acres sold and an increase in the average price per residential lot in Chenal Valley. The increase in Total Adjusted EBITDDA was partially offset by lower lumber prices, lower Northern sawlog harvest volumes and prices, and higher selling, general and administrative expenses.

2024 compared with 2023

Timberlands Adjusted EBITDDA for 2024 was $138.7 million, a decrease of $12.6 million compared to 2023 primarily as a result of the following:
•
Sales Price and Mix:
 Sawlog prices in the Northern region decreased 6.0%, to $110 per ton, primarily due to the effect of lower indexed sawlog prices in Idaho. Southern sawlog prices remained relatively flat. 
•
Harvest Volume: 
We harvested a total of 7.6 million tons across our Northern and Southern regions, which was in line with our plan at the beginning of the year. In our Southern region we harvested 6.2 million tons during both 2024 and 2023. Southern sawlog harvest volume during 2024 increased 7.0% compared to 2023 primarily due to more favorable operating conditions during 2024 partially offset by fewer stumpage sales. In the Northern region, slightly softer market demand during 2024 compared to 2023 contributed to the 3.6% decrease in harvest volume.
•
Logging and Hauling Cost per Unit:
 Logging and hauling costs per delivered unit were lower primarily due to a lower mix of Northern sawlogs, which have a higher cost per unit compared to Southern sawlogs, and lower fuel costs.

2024 compared with 2023

Wood Products Adjusted EBITDDA for 2024 decreased $28.1 million compared to 2023 primarily as a result of the following:
•
Lumber Price: 
Average lumber sales prices decreased to $425 per MBF during 2024 compared to $452 per MBF during 2023.
•
Manufacturing Cost Per Unit: 
Higher manufacturing costs per unit were primarily due to the impact of downtime and the restart related to the expansion and modernization project at our Waldo, Arkansas sawmill and increased labor costs from normal wage adjustments, partially offset by an increase in production at our Ola, Arkansas sawmill.
•
Log Costs Per Unit:
 Log costs per unit were lower primarily due to lower indexed log costs at our Idaho sawmill and improved production recoveries at our Southern sawmills.
•
Inventory Charge:
 Lower log costs and improved market pricing during 2024 resulted in no inventory write-downs at the end of 2024 compared to the end of 2023. 
•
Residual Sales, Panels and Other:
 Soft demand from industrial customers resulted in lower plywood price realization during 2024 compared to 2023, which more than offset higher residual sales.

2024 compared with 2023
Real Estate Adjusted EBITDDA for 2024 was $147.0 million, an increase of $79.2 million compared with 2023 
primarily as a result of the following:
•
Rural Real Estate Sales: 
The increase in rural real estate sales is primarily due to increased rural acres sold compared to 2023. Rural real estate sales during 2024 included a 34,100-acre sale of four-year average age Southern timberlands to FIA for $56.7 million, a 3,900-acre sale in Alabama, a 2,000-acre conservation sale in Arkansas, and a 1,200-acre sale in Idaho. Rural real estate sales in 2023 included a 2,240-acre conservation sale in Alabama, a 2,700-acre sale in Georgia, and a 1,660-acre sale in South Carolina. Rural real estate sales vary period-to-period with the average price per acre fluctuating based on both the geographic area of the real estate and type of land sold.

Development Real Estate Sales:
 During 2024, we sold 135 residential lots at an average lot price of $146,366 compared with 128 lots at an average lot price of $104,241 during 2023. In addition, we sold 12 acres of commercial land in Chenal Valley for an average price of $492,746 per acre during 2024 compared to 12 acres for an average price of $572,614 per acre during 2023. The average price per lot or commercial acre fluctuates based on a variety of factors, including size, location and planned end use within the developments.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
An important source of liquidity is cash generated from our operations, which is highly dependent on selling prices for our products, as described in 
Part I –
