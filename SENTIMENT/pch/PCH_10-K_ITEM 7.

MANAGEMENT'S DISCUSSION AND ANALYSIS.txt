They often involve use of words such as expects, may, could, should, will, believes, anticipates, estimates, expects, future, intends, plans, potential, projection, strive, targets, or similar words or terminology. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions and are not guarantees of future events or performance. The realization of our expectations and the accuracy of our assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.
