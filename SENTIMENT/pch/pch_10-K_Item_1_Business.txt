Net Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Net cash from operating activities increased $29.4 million in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of the following:
•
Cash received from customers increased $35.6 million primarily due to increased rural real estate acres sold, including the 34,100-acre sale to FIA, higher average lot prices in Chenal Valley, and higher Southern sawlog harvest volumes. These increases were partly offset by lower lumber prices, a decrease in Northern harvest volumes and sawlog prices, and fewer Southern stumpage sales.
•
Cash payments decreased $21.8 million primarily due to lower Northern logging and hauling costs, lower real estate development expenditures at Chenal Valley, and lower employee incentive compensation payouts. These declines were partially offset by costs associated with higher Southern sawlog harvest volumes, increased professional service costs and implementation costs of new systems.
•
During 2024, we received the final $1.7 million of insurance proceeds related to business interruption insurance following the fire at our Ola, Arkansas sawmill in June 2021, compared to $36.4 million received during 2023.
•
Cash paid for interest, net increased by approximately $10.1 million primarily due to lower interest income earned as a result of lower average cash balances in interest bearing accounts partially offset by increased patronage dividends from our lenders. Additionally, cash from operating activities during 2024 includes reclassification of $29.7 million received from interest rate swaps that contain an other-than-insignificant financing element at inception as investing ($27.6 million) and financing ($2.1 million) activities. Cash from operating activities during 2023 includes reclassification of $25.6 million received from interest rate swaps that contain an other-than-insignificant financing element at inception as investing ($23.8 million) and financing ($1.8 million) activities.
•
Net tax payments decreased $24.1 million as a result of lower taxable income generated from our TRS during 2024. 
•
Cash contributions to our pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans increased $5.2 million, primarily due to a $4.0 million contribution to our qualified pension plan.
Net Cash Flows from Investing Activities
Changes in cash flows from investing activities were primarily a result of the following:
•
Cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment, timberlands reforestation and road construction projects during 2024 and 2023 was $88.7 million and $119.8 million, respectively, which includes payments for capital expenditures for the Waldo, Arkansas sawmill expansion and modernization project of $37.9 million and $74.2 million, respectively. 
•
Cash expenditures for timberland acquisitions in 2024 was $32.3 million which included the acquisition of 16,000 acres of mature timberlands in Arkansas. Cash expenditures for timberland acquisitions in 2023 was $1.8 million.

Table of Contents

•
We received $27.6 million during 2024 compared to $23.8 million during 2023 from certain interest rate swaps that contained an other-than-insignificant financing element at inception, which is required to be classified as an investing activity. Cash flows from these interest rate swaps reduce our interest costs on the corresponding variable-rate debt.
Net Cash Flows from Financing Activities
Changes in cash flows from financing activities were primarily a result of the following:

•
During 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 0.8 million and 0.5 million shares, respectively for approximately $35.0 million and $25.0 million, respectively.
•
Dividend payments of $142.4 million during 2024 compared to $143.6 million in 2023 due to fewer shares outstanding following share repurchases.
Future Sources and Uses of Cash
At December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $151.6 million. We expect cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash generated from operating activities, and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement, if needed, to be adequate to meet our future cash requirements over the next twelve months.
Our material cash commitments arising in the normal course of business under our known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2024 primarily relate to purchase obligations, repayments of long-term debt and related interest, payments under operating and financing leases and pension and postretirement benefits. Purchase obligations primarily include open purchase orders for goods or services, future payments due under timber cutting contracts, commitments for construction contracts, commitments to complete real estate development projects and commitments to acquire property and equipment in the next twelve months. At December 31, 2024, our purchase obligations were approximately $69.6 million, of which $37.4 million is expected to be paid in the next twelve months. Additionally, based on interest rates on our long-term debt at December 31, 2024, we expect net interest payments on long-term debt, including the impact of any associated interest rate swaps and estimated patronage credits from lenders, to be approximately $135.3 million over the term of the loans, of which approximately $25.0 million is expected to be paid in 2025.

Capital Expenditures
We invest cash in maintenance and discretionary capital expenditures at our Wood Products facilities. We also invest cash in the reforestation of timberlands and construction of roads in our Timberlands operations and to develop land in our Real Estate development operations. We evaluate discretionary capital improvements based on expected return on investment. We expect to spend a total of approximately $60 million to $65 million for capital expenditures during 2025, which excludes a final closeout payment of approximately $6.6 million related to the expansion and modernization of our Waldo, Arkansas sawmill (the Waldo Modernization Project).

During the third quarter of 2024, we completed the construction phase of the Waldo Modernization Project. The Waldo Modernization Project included upgrades to the log yard and planer, a new saw line, and a new continuous dry kiln and is expected to increase the sawmill’s annual capacity and reduce its operating costs significantly. The sawmill, which continued to operate during the construction, took limited downtime early in the third quarter to tie in the new equipment and restarted in mid-August 2024. We anticipate the sawmill will reach its expected new annual capacity run rate of 275 million board feet per year by mid-year of 2025. We capitalized approximately $131.0 million on the modernization project, of which a total of $124.4 million has been paid through December 31, 2024, and the remaining $6.6 million is expected to be paid in the first quarter of 2025.

Share Repurchase Program
On August 31, 2022, our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to $200.0 million of our common stock with no set time limit for the repurchases (the 2022 Repurchase Program). Concurrently, the board of directors terminated the remaining repurchase authorization under a previously authorized repurchase program. At December 31, 2024, we had remaining authorization of $90.0 million for future stock repurchases under the 2022 Repurchase Program. The timing, manner, price and amount of repurchases will be determined according to a trading plan adopted from time to time in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Trading Plan), and, subject to the terms of a Trading Plan, the 2022 Repurchase Program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason.

Long-Term Debt and Credit Agreement
At December 31, 2024, our total outstanding long-term debt was $1.0 billion, all of which was drawn under an amended and restated credit agreement dated as of March 22, 2018 (Amended Term Loan Agreement) with our primary lender, AgWest Farm Credit, PCA (as successor in interest to Northwest Farm Credit Services, PCA). All interest rates on our outstanding long-term debt are fixed either under fixed-rate loans or variable-rate loans with an associated interest rate swap that fixes the variable benchmark interest rate component.
On November 1, 2024, we entered into a tenth amendment to the Amended Term Loan Agreement, which provided for three new term loans totaling $176.0 million that mature on November 1, 2032, 2033, and 2034, respectively (collectively referred to as the New Term Loans). The proceeds of the New Term Loans were used to refinance a $110.0 million term loan that matured on November 1, 2024 and to replenish cash used to repay $65.7 million of revenue bonds that matured in October 2024. The New Term Loans bear interest at a rate equal to the daily simple SOFR-indexed rate plus an applicable margin ranging between 2.20% and 2.30% per annum depending on the term loan's maturity date. The New Term Loans provide for a cost-of-capital reset at year five whereby the applicable margin may be reset at the sole discretion of the lender.

In connection with the refinancing, we terminated $125.0 million of our $200.0 million forward-starting interest rate swaps and transferred the value realized from their termination into three new interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in future cash flows on the New Term Loans. These three new daily simple SOFR-indexed interest rate swaps effectively fix the interest rates on the New Term Loans between 4.02% and 4.28%, before patronage credits from lenders, depending on the maturity date of the associated term loan. At December 31, 2024, we had one remaining forward-starting interest rate swap of $75.0 million available to fix the interest rate on future debt refinancing.
At December 31, 2024, approximately $100.0 million of our outstanding long-term debt that matures in August 2025 was classified as current on our accompanying 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
 We expect to refinance this $100.0 million term loan at maturity.
We have a $300.0 million revolving line of credit with a syndicate of lenders that matures February 14, 2027 (Amended Credit Agreement). Under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, the amount of available principal may be increased up to an additional $500.0 million. We may also utilize borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement to, among other things, refinance existing indebtedness and provide funding for working capital requirements, capital projects, acquisitions, and other general corporate expenditures. At December 31, 2024, there were no borrowings under the revolving line of credit and approximately $0.6 million of the revolving line of credit was utilized by outstanding letters of credit.

Note 10: Derivative Instruments
 in the 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
 for additional information on our debt, credit, and interest rate swap agreements.
Financial Covenants
The Amended Credit Agreement and the Amended Term Loan Agreement (collectively referred to as the Financing Agreements) contain certain covenants that limit our ability and that of our subsidiaries to create liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, incur indebtedness and guarantees, repurchase or redeem capital stock and indebtedness, make certain investments or acquisitions, enter into certain transactions with affiliates or change the nature of our business. The Financing Agreements also contain financial maintenance covenants including the maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. We are permitted to pay dividends to our stockholders under the terms of the Financing Agreements so long as we expect to remain in compliance with the financial maintenance covenants.
The Interest Coverage Ratio is EBITDDA, which is defined in the Financing Agreements as net income adjusted for interest expense, net, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization, the basis of real estate sold and non-cash equity compensation expense, divided by interest expense, net for the same period.

Table of Contents

The Leverage Ratio is our Total Funded Indebtedness divided by our Total Asset Value (TAV). Our Total Funded Indebtedness consists of long-term debt, including any current portion of long-term debt, finance lease liabilities, revolving line of credit borrowings and the amount outstanding under the letter of credit subfacility.

Liquidity and Performance Measures
The discussion below is presented to enhance the reader’s understanding of our operating performance, ability to generate cash and satisfy rating agency and creditor requirements. This information includes two measures: Total Adjusted EBITDDA and Cash Available for Distribution (CAD). These measures are not defined by GAAP and the discussion of Total Adjusted EBITDDA and CAD is not intended to conflict with or change any of the GAAP disclosures described herein. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered only as supplemental to, and are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to other similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies due to potential inconsistencies in methods of calculation.
Total Adjusted EBITDDA is a non-GAAP measure that management uses in evaluating performance and to allocate resources between segments. Total Adjusted EBITDDA removes the impact of specific items that management believes do not directly reflect the core business operations on an ongoing basis. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure, when read in conjunction with our GAAP financial statements, provides useful information to investors and other interested parties by facilitating the comparability of our ongoing operating results over the periods presented and the identification of trends in our underlying business. It also can be used to evaluate the

43

Table of Contents

operational performance of the assets under management and to compare our operating results against analyst financial models and against the operating results of other public companies that supplement their GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures.

We define EBITDDA as net income before interest expense, net, income taxes, basis of real estate sold, depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDDA further excludes certain specific items that are considered to hinder comparison of the performance of our businesses either year-on-year or with other businesses. We reconcile Total Adjusted EBITDDA to net income for the consolidated company as it is the most comparable GAAP measure.

The following table provides a reconciliation of net income to Total Adjusted EBITDDA for the respective periods:

We define CAD as cash from operating activities adjusted for capital spending for purchases of property, plant and equipment, timberlands reforestation and roads and timberland acquisitions not classified as strategic. Management believes CAD is a useful indicator of the company’s overall liquidity, as it provides a measure of cash generated that is available for dividends to common stockholders (an important factor in maintaining our REIT status), repurchase of the company’s common shares, debt repayment, acquisitions and other discretionary and nondiscretionary activities. Our definition of CAD is limited in that it does not solely represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures since the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view CAD as a measure that provides supplemental information to our 
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
. Our definition of CAD may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies, including those in our industry. CAD is not necessarily indicative of the CAD that may be generated in future periods.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
In preparing our 
Consolidated Financial Statements
 in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates on a regular basis. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors. The following critical accounting policies and estimates require some of management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgment.
Pension benefits.
 The measurement of the pension benefit obligation, determination of pension plan net periodic costs, and the requirements for funding our pension plans are based on actuarial assumptions that require judgment. The most significant assumption is the discount rate used to value the current cost of future pension obligations as different assumptions would change the net periodic pension costs and funded status of the benefit plans.

The discount rate is determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits. The selection of discount rates requires judgment as well as the involvement of actuarial specialists. These specialists assist with selecting yield curves based on published indices for high-quality corporate bonds and projecting the timing and amount of cash flows associated with our obligations to ultimately support our determination of an appropriate discount rate for our pension plans. We use these estimates to calculate plan obligation information as of year-end as well as pension costs for the following year. Actual experience that differs from our estimates, or any changes in our estimates that support the actuarial methods and assumptions could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Pension expense for 2025 will be based on a 5.75% discount rate. Holding all other assumptions constant, a 25-basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the total projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2024 by approximately $6.0 million and have a minimal impact on estimated pension expense for 2025.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AN
D QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Our market risk exposure on financial instruments includes interest rate risk on our bank revolving line of credit, term loans and interest rate swap agreements and forward-starting interest rate swap agreements. We are exposed to interest rate volatility on existing variable-rate debt instruments and future incurrences of fixed or variable rate debt, which exposure primarily relates to movements in various interest rates. We use interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances, respectively. All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading purposes. We do not attempt to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk for our cash equivalents.
The interest rates applied to borrowings under our revolving line of credit adjust often and therefore react quickly to any movement in the general trend of market interest rates. We do not attempt to mitigate the effects of short-term interest rate fluctuations on our revolving line of credit borrowings through the use of derivative financial instruments. There were no borrowings under our revolving line of credit at December 31, 2024.
At December 31, 2024, we have interest rate swaps associated with $937 million of term loan debt. We use forward-starting interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure related to the anticipated refinancing of existing term loan debt. At December 31, 2024, we had one forward-starting interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge with a notional amount of $75 million available to fix the interest rate on future debt refinancing. Our cash flow hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged interest rate risk through the term of the hedge. See 
Note 10: Derivative Instruments
 in the 
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 for additional information.

ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STAT
EMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors
PotlatchDeltic Corporation:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PotlatchDeltic Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 13, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Measurement of the pension benefit obligation
As discussed in Notes 1 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s pension benefit obligation was $233.0 million as of December 31, 2024. The measurement of the pension benefit obligation is based on actuarial assumptions that require judgment. The discount rate applied to pension plan obligations is a critical assumption in the measurement of the pension benefit obligation.

Table of Contents

We identified the evaluation of the measurement of the pension benefit obligation as a critical audit matter. Specialized skills and knowledge were required to evaluate the discount rate used to determine the pension benefit obligation. In addition, there was subjective judgment in applying and evaluating results of the procedures due to the sensitivity of the pension benefit obligation to changes in the discount rate.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s pension benefit process. This included a control related to the determination of the discount rate assumption. We involved an actuarial professional with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the discount rate as determined using the hypothetical bond portfolio model through analyzing the bond selection criteria, the bond ratings, and the cash flow matching of the model. We considered the change in the discount rate from that used in the prior year, including consideration of the changes in the discount rate in light of published indices.

Notes to Consol
idated Financial Statements
NOTE 1.  SUMMARY OF SIG
NIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
GENERAL
PotlatchDeltic Corporation (collectively referred to in this report as the company, us, we or our) is a leading timberland Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) with operations in nine states. We are engaged in activities associated with timberland management, including the sale of timber, the ownership and management of 
2.1
 million acres of timberlands and the purchase and sale of timberlands. We are also engaged in the manufacture and sale of wood products and the development of real estate. Our timberlands, real estate development projects and all of our Wood Products facilities are located within the continental United States. The primary market for our products is the United States. We converted to a REIT effective January 1, 2006.

CONSOLIDATION
The 
Consolidated Financial Statements
 include the accounts of PotlatchDeltic Corporation and its subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany transactions and accounts.

USE OF ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which we refer to in this report as GAAP, requires management to make estimates and judgments affecting the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
Cash equivalents are investments that are highly liquid with original maturities of three months or less when purchased.

BUSINESS COMB
INATIONS AND ACQUISITIONS
We apply the principles provided in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805,
 Business Combinations
, to determine whether an acquisition involves an asset or a business. In determining whether an acquisition should be accounted for as a business combination or asset acquisition, we first determine whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this is the case, the single identifiable asset or the group of similar assets is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If this is not the case, we then further evaluate whether the single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets and activities includes, at a minimum, an

55

input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. If so, the transaction is accounted for as a business combination.
We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that (i) identifiable assets acquired (including identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities assumed generally be measured and recognized at estimated fair value as of the acquisition date and (ii) the excess of the purchase price over the net estimated fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized as goodwill, which is not amortized for accounting purposes but is subject to testing for impairment at least annually. We measure and recognize asset acquisitions that are not deemed to be business combinations based on the cost to acquire the assets. Goodwill is not recognized in an asset acquisition with any consideration in excess of net assets acquired allocated to acquired assets on a relative estimated fair value basis. Transaction costs are expensed in a business combination and transaction costs directly attributable to an asset acquisition are considered a component of the cost of the asset acquisition.

On September 14, 2022, CatchMark and CatchMark Timber Operating Partnership, L.P. (the Partnership) merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary (Merger Sub) of PotlatchDeltic, pursuant to the terms of a merger agreement dated May 29, 2022, with the Merger Sub surviving
 the mergers. As a result of the merger, we issued approximately 
11.5
 million shares of PotlatchDeltic common stock, including (i) 
11.3
 million shares in exchange for the outstanding shares of CatchMark common stock, which included unvested CatchMark share-based awards that fully vested upon closing of the merger and (ii) 
0.2
 million shares in exchange for the Partnership OP Units. We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition as substantially all the value of the acquisition was concentrated in the acquired timber and timberlands. We allocated the cost of the acquisition to the net assets acquired based on their relative estimated fair value on the acquisition date with the assistance of a third-party specialist. This resulted in an allocation of $
782.3
 million to timber and timberlands, $
3.0
 million to intangible assets, $
32.0
 million to other assets and $
23.6
 million for cash acquired in the merger. Additionally, we assumed $
323.1
 million of liabilities, including $
300.0
 million of outstanding long-term debt. We capitalized transaction costs of $
9.3
 million for items such as investment banking fees, legal services, and other professional fees directly attributable to the merger. 
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we incurred non-capitalizable merger costs in connection with the CatchMark merger of approximately $
0
, $
2.5
 million, and $
27.3
 million, respectively. 
These costs are included in CatchMark merger-related expenses in our 
Consolidated Statements of Operations.
REVENUE RECOGNITION
We recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (ASC 606). For our Timberlands segment, we generate revenue predominantly in the form of delivered logs, pay-as-cut stumpage contracts, lump sum stumpage contracts and timber deeds. For our Wood Products segment we generate revenue from the sale of manufactured wood products and residual by-products. For our Real Estate segment, we generate revenue from the sale of rural real property deemed non-strategic or identified as having higher and better use alternatives and real estate development and subdivision activity.
Sales outside of the United States are inconsequential and 
no
 single customer represented more than 10% of our consolidated revenues during 2024, 2023 or 2022. 
See 
Note 2: Segment Information
 for information on our revenues by major products.

Performance Obligations
A performance obligation, as defined in ASC 606, is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue at the point in time, or over the period in which the performance obligation is satisfied.

Performance obligations associated with delivered logs sales are typically recognized at the point the logs are delivered and scaled at our customers’ mills. Revenue is recognized on timber deeds and lump sum stumpage contracts generally upon closing or when the contracts are effective, which is the point at which the buyer assumes risk of loss associated with the standing timber. We enter into pay-as-cut contracts with customers that provide the customer with the right of access to harvest timber on a specified area of our land. At the execution of the agreement, the customer typically does not take title, control or risk of ownership to the timber. Revenue for pay-as-cut contracts is recognized once scaling occurs as that is the point when control of the harvested trees has transferred to the customer and we have a right to payment.

56

Table of Contents

Performance obligations associated with the sale of wood products are typically satisfied when the products are shipped (FOB shipping point) or upon delivery to our customer (FOB destination) depending on the terms of the customer contract. Shipping and handling costs for all wood products, log hauling costs and residual sales are accounted for as cost of goods sold in our 
Consolidated Statements of Operations
. We also enter into vendor managed inventory (VMI) programs with certain customers whereby inventory is shipped to a VMI warehouse. For products shipped under VMI arrangements, revenue is recognized and billed when control transfers to the customer and we have no further obligations, which is generally once the customer pulls the inventory from the VMI warehouse. Performance obligations associated with real estate sales are generally satisfied at a point in time when all conditions of closing have been met and title transfers to the buyer.
We record deferred revenue for hunting and other access rights on our timberlands, payments received for shipments where control of goods have not transferred, member related activities at an owned country club and certain post-close obligations for real estate sales. These contract liabilities are recognized over the term of the contracts, which is typically twelve months or less, except for initiation fees which are recognized over the average life of club membership. See 
Note: 8 Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities
 for additional information.

ASC 606 requires entities to consider significant financing components of contracts with customers, though allows for the use of a practical expedient when the period between satisfaction of a performance obligation and payment receipt is one year or less. Given the nature of our revenue transactions, we have elected to utilize this practical expedient.
Contract Estimates
There are no significant contract estimates as substantially all of our performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time. The transaction price for log sales includes amounts billed for logging and hauling and generally equals the amount billed to our customer for logs delivered during the accounting period. For the limited number of log sales subject to a long-term supply agreement, the transaction price is variable but is known at the time of billing. For wood products sales, the transaction price is typically the amount billed to the customer for the products shipped but may be reduced slightly for estimated cash discounts and rebates. In general, a customer receivable is recorded as we deliver wood products, logs and residuals. We generally receive payment shortly after products have been received by our customers. For real estate sales, 
we typically receive the entire consideration in cash at closing. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for credit losses associated with our customer receivables was insignificant.

INVENTORIES
For most of our Wood Products operations, we use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method to value log, lumber and plywood inventory as we believe the LIFO method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenue. Inventories valued under LIFO are stated at the lower of cost or market. All segment inventories are reported using the average cost method. The LIFO reserve and intersegment eliminations are recorded at the corporate level.
Inventories not valued under LIFO are recorded at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Expenses associated with idle capacity or abnormally low production are reflected in cost of goods sold in the periods incurred. See 
Note 4: Inventories
 for additional information.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of buildings, equipment and other depreciable assets is determined using the straight-line method of depreciation.
Major improvements and replacements of property are capitalized. Maintenance, repairs and minor improvements and replacements are expensed. Upon retirement or other disposition of property, applicable cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts. Any gains or losses are included in operating income. See 
Note 5: Property, Plant and Equipment
 for additional information.
RECOVERY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

Our 
long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We evaluate recoverability of an asset group by comparing its carrying value to the future net undiscounted cash flows that we expect will be generated by the asset group. If the comparison indicates that the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable, we recognize an impairment loss for the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value. When we recognize an impairment loss for assets to be held and used, we depreciate the adjusted carrying amount of those assets over their estimated remaining useful life. We also perform a test for recoverability when management has committed to a plan to sell or otherwise dispose of an asset group. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less

cost 
to sell. There were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated the carrying amounts of our other long-lived held and used assets were not recoverable during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.

TIMBER AND TIMBERLANDS
Timber and timberlands are valued at cost less accumulated depletion and depreciation. We capitalize costs related to stand establishment, which include the preparation of the land for planting, seeds or seedlings and tree planting costs, which include third-party labor costs, materials and other contract services. Upon completion of planting activities and field inspection to confirm the planting operation was successful, a plantation is considered “established.”

Subsequent expenditures to maintain the integrity or enhance the growth of an established plantation or stand are expensed. Post-establishment expenses include vegetation control, fertilization, thinning operations and the replanting of seedlings lost through mortality. Forest management costs are considered current operating expenses and include property taxes and insurance, silviculture costs incurred subsequent to stand establishment, cruising of timber volume, property maintenance, salaries, supplies, travel, record-keeping, fire protection and other normal recurring administrative personnel costs.

The components of timberland acquisitions are capitalized and allocated based on the relative estimated fair values of timberland, merchantable timber, pre-production timber (young growth that is not yet merchantable timber), logging roads and other land improvements.
The estimated volume of current standing merchantable timber, which is a component of calculating our depletion rates, is updated at least annually to reflect increases due to the reclassification of pre-production timber to merchantable timber when it meets defined diameter specifications, the annual growth of merchantable timber and the acquisition of additional merchantable timber, decreases due to timber harvests and land sales and changes resulting from other factors, such as disease or casualty losses. Timber volumes are estimated from cruises of the timber tracts, which are completed on our timberlands on approximately a 
five
-to-
ten year
 cycle.

Depletion represents the amount charged to expense as timber is harvested. Rates at which timber is depleted are calculated annually for each of our depletion pools by dividing the beginning of year balance of the merchantable timber accounts by the volume of standing merchantable timber, after estimated timber volume updates.
The base cost of logging roads, such as clearing, grading and ditching, is not depreciated and remains a capitalized item until disposition. Other portions of the initial logging road cost, such as bridges, culverts and gravel surfacing are depreciated over their useful lives, which range from 
5
 to 
20 years
. Costs associated with temporary logging road spurs, which are typically used for one harvest season, are expensed as incurred. See 
Note 6: Timber and Timberlands
 for additional information.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS
We have both indefinite-lived and long-lived intangible assets. Long-lived intangible assets include customer relationships and certain trade names we estimate have a finite life and are being amortized between 
3
 and 
20
 years depending on the type of intangible asset, and are evaluated for impairment under our Recovery of Long-Lived Assets policy described above. There were 
no
 new intangible assets recorde
d during the year ended December 31, 2024. 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a $
3.0
 million intangible asset for cust
omer relationships acquired in the CatchMark merger. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the gross carrying amount of our long-lived intangible assets was $
11.4
 million, and accumulated amortization was $
7.7
 million and $
6.0
 million, respectively. Amortization expense for the customer relationships and trade names totaled $
1.8
 million in both 2024 and 2023, and $
1.1
 million in 2022.

Estimated annual amortization expense for each of the next five years is as follows:

 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023 and are not amortized. Rather, they are tested for potential impairments annually as of October 1, or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the assets. We did 
no
t impair any intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.

Table of Contents

COMPANY OWNED LIFE INSURANCE
We are the beneficiary of insurance policies on the lives of certain past officers and employees. We have recognized the amount that could be realized upon surrender of the insurance policies in other assets in our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
. Company owned life insurance expense and interest income are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and interest expense, net, respectively, in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations
. The net effect of these amounts on income was not significant for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Cash receipts and disbursements are recorded as investing activities within Other, net in the 
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
.
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
We use, from time to time, certain derivative instruments to mitigate exposure to volatility in interest rates and effectively convert a portion of floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis, thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense and cash flows. All derivatives, whether designated as a hedging relationship or not, are recorded in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
 at fair value. The accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, we must designate the hedging instrument as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge based on the exposure being hedged. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did 
no
t hold any derivatives designated or qualifying as fair value hedges.
For a cash flow hedge, the fair value of the effective portion of the derivative is recognized as an asset or liability with a corresponding amount in Accumulated other comprehensive income on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
.
 Amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized in earnings when the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings. Ineffectiveness is measured by comparing the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows of the derivative and the present value of the cumulative change in the expected future cash flows of the related instrument. Any ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge is recognized in earnings immediately.

If a hedge ceases to qualify for hedge accounting, the contract will continue to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value until settled and adjustments to the contract’s fair value would be recognized in earnings. If a forecasted transaction were no longer probable of occurring, amounts previously deferred in Accumulated other comprehensive income would be recognized immediately in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as hedges, the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in earnings each reporting period.
Cash flows associated with all derivative instruments are reported as cash flows from operating activities in the 
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
, unless the derivative contains an other-than-insignificant financing element at the inception date, in which case the derivative instrument's cash flows are reported as either cash flows from investing or financing activities depending on the derivative's off-market nature at inception.

We have International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) Master Agreements with each counterparty that permits the net settlement of amounts owed under the respective contracts. The ISDA Master Agreement is an industry standardized contract that governs all derivative contracts entered into between the company and the respective counterparty. Under these master netting agreements, net settlement generally permits the company or the counterparty to determine the net amount payable or receivable for contracts due on the same date for similar types of derivative transactions. We have not elected to offset the fair value positions of the derivative contracts recorded in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
. See 
Note 10: Derivative Instruments
 for additional information.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
We use a fair value hierarchy in accounting for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities including long-lived assets (asset groups) measured at fair value for an impairment assessment and pension plan assets measured at fair value.
The fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity’s pricing based upon its own market assumptions.
The fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:
•
Level 1: Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.
•
Level 2: Inputs are quoted prices in non-active markets for which pricing inputs are observable either directly or indirectly at the reporting date.

59

Table of Contents

•
Level 3: Inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are observed.
Additionally, investments in common and collective trust funds are generally valued based on their respective net asset value (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to estimate fair value due to the absence of a readily determinable fair value. Such investments are not classified within the fair value hierarchy and are separately disclosed.
See 
Note 11: Fair Value Measurements
 for additional information.
EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION
Equity-based awards are measured at estimated fair value on the dates they are granted or modified. These measurements establish the cost of the equity-based awards for accounting purposes. Equity-based compensation expense is recognized over the awards’ applicable vesting period using the straight-line method. We account for forfeitures as they occur. Equity based compensation is classified in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations
 based on the function to which the related services are provided. See 
Note 12: Equity-Based Compensation Plans
 for additional information.
LEASES
We lease certain equipment, office space and land. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments.
Most leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term between 
one
 to 
five years
. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. Under the operating lease model, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Under the finance lease model, lease expense consists of the amortization of the ROU asset on a straight-line basis over the asset’s estimated useful life and interest expense calculated using the effective interest method. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. Certain of our rental payments are adjusted periodically for inflation. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants and we do not have any significant sublease income. See 
Note 13: Leases
 for additional information.
INCOME TAXES
We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured pursuant to tax laws using rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect of a change in income tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations
 and 
Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income
 in the period that includes the enactment date of the rate change. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized.

We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities. The determination is based on the technical merits of the position and presumes that each uncertain tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. See 
Note 14: Income Taxes
 for additional information.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
We recognize any overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
 and recognize changes in the funded status through comprehensive income (loss) in the year in which the changes occur. The funded status and the requirements for funding our pension plans are based on a number of actuarial assumptions that require judgment. The determination of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs includes:
•
costs of benefits provided in exchange for employees’ services rendered;
•
interest cost of the obligation; 
•
expected long-term return on plan assets for funded plans;
•
amortization of prior service costs and plan amendments over the average remaining service period of the active employee group covered by the plan; and 
•
amortization of cumulative unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses – generally in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the benefit obligation or market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year – over the average remaining service period of the active employee group covered by the plan. 
Different assumptions would change the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs and the obligation of the benefit plans. See 
Note 15: Savings Plans, Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits
 for additional information.
COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND LEGAL MATTERS
We accrue estimates for resolution of any legal and other contingencies when losses are probable and estimable, in accordance with ASC 450, 
Contingencies. 
Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. At any given time, we are subject to claims and actions incidental to the operations of our business. Based on information currently available, management believes the company is not a party to any legal proceeding that could have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, operating results, or net cash flow.
Environmental Matter
Pursuant to a 2002 Asset Purchase Agreement under which Sappi Cloquet LLC (Sappi) purchased our Cloquet, Minnesota pulp and paper mill (the Plant), we agreed to indemnify Sappi from certain environmental liabilities accruing from the pre-sale operations of the Plant. In February 2021, we were notified by Sappi that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) contacted Sappi about the opportunity to participate with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) and the EPA in a voluntary federal sediment remediation program under the Great Lakes Legacy Act (GLLA) for a project in the St. Louis River Area of Concern, which runs from Cloquet, Minnesota to Lake Superior. The EPA’s invitation to Sappi made no demands on or claims against Sappi, nor have the EPA or the MPCA made any demands or claims against PotlatchDeltic.
The identified sediment remediation project (the Project) at Thomson Reservoir is downstream from the Plant. The Plant was identified for potential partnership with the EPA and the MPCA on the Project based on the Plant's historic direct discharges of wastewater and leachate from the Plant's landfill into the St. Louis River prior to the re-routing of the discharge in 1979 to a public wastewater facility. After multiple discussions with the MPCA and completion of our extensive due diligence on this matter, we informed the MPCA in January 2023 that we were int
erested in voluntarily participating in the Project, subject to an equitable division with the MPCA for our share of the costs and accrued $
5.6
 million at December 31, 2022 for our estimated contribution to the Project. We executed a Project agreement with the EPA and the MPCA in October 2023 and estimated our share of the total Project costs between $
5.6
 million and $
6.7
 million.

In accordance with the Project agreement, we made a $
3.4
 million payment in November 2023, for our initial share of the Project costs. 
No
 payments were made during the year ended December 31, 2024 or 2022. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately $
2.2
 million was accrued for our estimated remaining contribution to the Project, all of which is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
. While it is reasonably possible that costs may change as the Project develops and work contracts are executed, we are unable to estimate at this time the amount of change, if any, which may be required for our share of this matter in the future.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. ASU 2023-07 provides updates to qualitative and quantitative reportable segment disclosure requirements, including enhanced disclosures about significant segment expense categories that are regularly reported to the chief operating decision maker and included in each reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss and increased interim disclosure requirements, among others. The 
adoption
 of this ASU on 
January 1, 2024
, including the required retrospective application for all periods presented in the financial statements, is reflected in our annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, and will be reflected in our interim financial statements beginning in 2025. All required disclosures under the standard will be provided within this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as within Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for each subsequent interim reporting period. However, there was 
no impact
 to the consolidated financial statements upon adoption. Refer to 
Note 2: Segment Information
 for our expanded segment disclosures.
Recent Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
. ASU 2023-09 provides qualitative and quantitative updates to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures, among others, in order to enhance the transparency of income tax disclosures, including consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation including disaggregation by jurisdiction of income taxes paid. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The amendments may be applied prospectively or retrospectively, and early adoption is permitted. Management is evaluating this ASU and does not expect it will have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, as the guidance pertains to disclosure only.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, 
Income Statement — Reporting Comprehensive Income — Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
, which is intended to improve disclosures about a public business entity’s expenses by requiring disaggregated quantitative disclosure, in the notes to the financial statements, of prescribed expense categories included within relevant income statement expense captions. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, and early adoption is permitted. Management is evaluating this ASU and does not expect it will have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, as the guidance pertains to disclosure only.
RECLASSIFICATIONS
Certain prior period reclassifications were made to conform with the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported net income, net income per share, comprehensive income, cash flows, total assets, total liabilities, or shareholders' equity as previously reported.
NOTE 2.  SEGMENT INFORMATION
Our operations are organized into 
three
 reportable segments: Timberlands, Wood Products and Real Estate, all of which are strategic business units that offer different products and services. The segments are managed separately because each business provides different products and utilizes different marketing strategies. Management activities in the Timberlands segment include planting and harvesting trees and building and maintaining roads. The Timberlands segment also generates revenues from non-timber resources such as hunting leases, recreation permits and leases, mineral rights contracts, oil and gas royalties and carbon sequestration. The Wood Products segment manufactures and sells lumber and plywood. The Real Estate segment includes the sale of land holdings deemed non-strategic or identified as having higher and better use alternatives, a master planned community development and a country
 club.
Our Timberlands segment supplies our Wood Products segment with a portion of its wood fiber needs. These intersegment revenues are based on prevailing market prices as if the sales were to third parties, and typically represent a sizable portion of the Timberlands segment's total revenues. Our other segments generally do not generate intersegment revenues. These intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The reportable segments follow the same accounting policies used for our 
Consolidated Financial Statements
 with the exception of the valuation of inventories, which are reported using the average cost method for purposes of reporting segment results.

Table of Contents

The company's chief operating decision maker (CODM) is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses segment information to, including but not limited to, assess performance, allocate capital and personnel, budget and forecast, and determine compensation of certain employees. The CODM uses Adjusted EBITDDA to evaluate the operating performance and effectiveness of operating strategies of our segments and allocation of resources to them.

EBITDDA is calculated as net income before interest expense, income taxes, basis of real estate sold, depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDDA further excludes certain specific items that are considered to hinder comparison of the performance of our businesses either year-on-year or with other businesses. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDDA may not be comparable to that reported by other companies.
The following tables summarize information for each of the company’s reportable segments including a reconciliation of Segment operating income (loss) as the closest measurement to GAAP for the reportable segments, Segment Adjusted EBITDDA and Total Adjusted EBITDDA to consolidated income before income taxes. Corporate information is included to reconcile segment data to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

For stock-based awards, the dilutive effect is calculated using the treasury stock method. Under this method, the dilutive effect is computed as if the awards were exercised at the beginning of the period (or at time of issuance, if later) and assumes the related proceeds were used to repurchase common stock at the average market price during the period. Related proceeds include future compensation cost associated with the stock award.
At December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, there were ap
proximately 
109,900
, 
17,900
, and 
119,000
 stock-based awards, respectively, which were excluded from the ca
lculation of earnings per share because they were anti-dilutive. Anti-dilutive stock-based awards could be dilutive in future periods.
SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM
On August 30, 2018, our board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to $
100.0
 million of common stock with no time limit set for the repurchase (the 2018 Repurchase Program).

Shares under the 2022 Repurchase Program may be repurchased in open market transactions, through privately negotiated transactions, and as in all reported years, pursuant to a trading plan adopted from time to time in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (Trading Plan). The timing, manner, price and amount of repurchases will be determined according to the terms of a Trading Plan, and, subject to the terms of a Trading Plan, the 2022 Repurchase Program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we repurc

Variable-rate term loans are at rates of one-month SOFR plus a spread between 
1.61
% and 
2.30
%, or daily simple SOFR plus a spread between 
2.20
% and 
2.30
%. The variable-rate term loans mature between 
2026 
and 
2034
. As of December 31, 2024, the one-month SOFR rate was 
4.55
% and the daily simple SOFR rate was 
4.64
%. We have entered into interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate on these variable-rate term loans. See 
Note 10: Derivative Instruments
 for additional information.

TERM LOANS
At December 31, 2024, approximately $
1.0
 billion was o
utstanding under our Second Amended and Restated Term Loan Agreement (Amended Term Loan Agreement) with our primary lender.
On November 1, 2024, we entered into a tenth amendment to the Amended Term Loan Agreement, which provided for a new 
8-year
 term loan of $
38.0
 million maturing on 
November 1, 2032
, a new 
9-year
 term loan of $
38.0
 million maturing on 
November 1, 2033
, and a new 
10-year
 term loan of $
100.0
 million maturing on 
November 1, 2034
 (collectively, the New Term Loans). The proceeds of the New Term Loans were used to refinance a $
110.0
 million term loan under the Amended Term Loan agreement that matured on 
November 1, 2024
, and to replenish cash used to repay a $
65.7
 million revenue bond that matured in October 
2024
.

The New Term Loans bear interest at a rate equal to daily simple SOFR plus an applicable margin ranging between 
2.20
% and 
2.30
% per annum depending on their respective maturity date. The New Term Loans provide for a cost-of-capital reset at year five whereby the applicable margin may be reset at the sole discretion of the lender. In connection with the New Term Loans, we terminated $
125.0
 million of our forward-starting interest rate swaps and transferred the value realized from their termination into three new daily simple SOFR-indexed interest rate swaps to fix the interest rates associated with the New Term Loans between 
4.02
% and 
4.28
%, before patronage credits from lenders, depending on the maturity date of the associated term loan.

In December 2023, through a ninth amendment to the Amended Term Loan Agreement, we refinanced an existing term loan of $
40.0
 million that matured with a new term loan that matures in 
December 2033
. The new term loan carries a variable interest rate of one-month SOFR 
plus 2.30%. In conjunction with the new term loan, we terminated a $
50.0
 million forward-starting interest rate swap and transferred the value realized from its termination into a new $
40.0
 million interest rate swap to fix the rate at 
3.35
% before patronage credits from lenders.

CREDIT AGREEMENT
On May 18, 2023, we entered into a first amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (Amended Credit Agreement). The Amended Credit Agreement provides for loans based on SOFR instead of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), provides us the option to borrow based on a daily SOFR or term SOFR basis, and provides mechanics relating to the transition from the use of SOFR to a replacement benchmark rate upon the occurrence of certain transition events.

The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a $
300.0
 million revolving line of credit that matures 
February 14, 2027
. As provided in the Amended Credit Agreement, the borrowing capacity may be increased up to an additional $
500.0
 million. The Amended Credit Agreement 
also includes a sublimit of $
75.0
 million for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a sublimit of $
25.0
 million for swing line loans. Usage under either or both sub facilities reduces availability under the revolving line of credit. 
We may also utilize borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement to, among other things, refinance existing indebtedness and provide funding for working capital requirements, capital projects, acquisitions and other general corporate expenditures.
Pricing on the Amended Credit Agreement is set according to the type of borrowing. SOFR 
borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement are issued at a rate equal to the Adjusted Daily Simple SOFR rate (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) plus an applicable rate. Base Rate borrowings are issued at a rate equal to a Base Rate, which is a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 
one half
 of 
one
 percent, (b) the Adjusted Term SOFR for a one-month tenor in effect on such day, plus 
1
%, and (c) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by KeyBank as its "prime rate." The interest rates we pay for borrowings under either type of loan include an additional Applicable Rate, which can range from 
0.85
% to 
1.10
% for SOFR loans and actual rate for Base Rate loans can range from 
0
% to 
0.10
% depending on our credit rating. Additionally, the Amended Credit Agreement provides mechanics relating to the transition from the use of SOFR to a replacement benchmark rate upon the occurrence of certain transition events or elections made by the parties. As of December 31, 2024, we were able to borrow under the revolving line of credit with an additional Applicable Rate of 
1.025
% for SOFR loans and 
0.025
% for Base Rate loans. We also pay an annual facility fee of 
0.175
% on the $
300.0
 million on our revolving line of credit. At December 31, 2024, there were 
no
 borrowings under the revolving line of credit and approximately $
0.6
 million of the revolving line of credit was utilized by outstanding letters of credit.

FINANCIAL COVENANTS
The Amended Term Loan Agreement and the Amended Credit Agreement (collectively referred to as the Agreements) contain certain covenants that limit our ability and that of our subsidiaries to create liens, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, incur indebtedness and guarantees, repurchase or redeem capital stock and indebtedness, make certain investments or acquisitions, enter into certain transactions with affiliates or change the nature of our business. The Agreements also contain financial maintenance covenants including the maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. We are permitted to pay dividends to our stockholders under the terms of the Agreements so long as we expect to remain in compliance with the financial maintenance covenants. We were in compliance with all debt and credit agreement covenants at December 31, 2024.

NOTE 10.  DE
RIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
From time to time, we enter into derivative financial instruments to manage certain cash flow and fair value risks. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in the cash flows of a specific asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered cash flow hedges. All our cash flow hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged interest rate risk through the term of the hedges.
At December 31, 2024, we had interest rate swaps associated with $
761.0
 million of SOFR-indexed term loan debt whereby the cash flow hedges convert variable rates ranging from one-month SOFR plus a spread between 
1.61
% to 
2.30
%, to fixed rates ranging from 
2.14
% to 
4.83
% before patronage credits from lenders. Additionally, at December 31, 2024, we had $
176.0
 million of interest rate swaps associated with SOFR-indexed term loan debt whereby the cash flow hedges convert variable rates ranging from daily simple SOFR-indexed plus a spread of 
2.20
% to 
2.30
%, to fixed rates ranging from 
4.02
% to 
4.28
% before patronage credits from lenders. At December 31, 2024, we have a $
75.0
 million forward-starting interest rate swap designated as a cash flow hedge for expected future debt refinancing that requires settlement on the stated maturity date. See 
Note 9: Debt
 for additional information.
The gross fair values of our cash flow derivative instruments at December 31, 2024 and 2023
 were $
138.4
 millio
n and $
129.1
 million, respectively, all of which were classified in Other assets, non-current on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
. Derivative instruments that mature within one year, as a whole, are classified as current.

Realized gains and losses on interest rate contracts consist of realized net cash received or paid and interest accruals on the interest rate swaps during the periods in addition to amortization of amounts out of other comprehensive income related to certain terminated hedges and adjustments to interest expense resulting from amortization of inception value of certain off-market designated hedges. 
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we amortized approximately $
10.8
 million, $
10.3

3.1
 million, respectively, of the off-market designated hedges which is included within operating activities in the 
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
. Net cash received or paid is included within Interest expense, net in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

At December 31, 2024, the amount of net gains expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months is approximately $
16.3
 million. However, this expected amount to be reclassified into earnings is subject to volatility as the ultimate amount recognized in earnings is based on the SOFR rate at the time of net swap cash payments.

The carrying amount of long-term debt includes principal and unamortized discounts.

The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on third-party sources on the expected cash flows of each derivative. The analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate forward curves.
The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar debt issues or estimated based on average market prices for comparable debt when there is no quoted market price.

72

Table of Contents

The contract value of our company owned life insurance is based on the amount at which it could be redeemed and, accordingly, approximates fair value.

We believe that our other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables and payables have net carrying value that approximates their fair value with only insignificant differences. This is primarily due to the short-term nature of these instruments.
NOTE 12.  EQUITY-BASE

Consolidated Statements of Operations
. See 
Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
 for additional information.
PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS
During 2024, 2023 and 2022, officers and certain other employees of the company were granted performance share awards (PSAs). PSAs granted under the stock incentive plans have a 
three-year
 performance period and shares are issued at the end of the period to the extent that performance measures are met. Performance share awards are earned based on the company's total shareholder return (TSR) over a 
three-year
 performance period relative to the median TSR of performance peer group (weighted 
50
%) and the company's TSR percentile ranking relative to all companies within the NAREIT All Equity REITs Index (of which we are a member) (weighted 
50
%) over such performance period. TSR is calculated based on stock price appreciation plus cash and share distributions. The number of shares actually issued, as a percentage of the amount subject to the PSA, could range from 
0
% to 
200
%. PSAs granted under our stock incentive plans do not have voting rights unless and until shares are issued upon settlement. If shares are issued at the end of the 
three-year
 performance measurement period, the recipients will receive dividend equivalents in the form of additional shares at the time of payment equal to the dividends that would have been paid on the shares earned had the recipients owned the shares during the three-year period. Therefore, the shares are not considered participating securities.
Since the awards contain a market condition, the effect of the market condition is reflected in the grant-date fair value, which is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation. This method is used to estimate the stock prices of PotlatchDeltic and the selected peer companies at the end of the three-year performance period. The Monte Carlo simulation uses inputs such as stock prices and expected volatility of PotlatchDeltic and the peer groups of companies as of the award date. Multiple simulations are generated, resulting in share prices and total shareholder return values for PotlatchDeltic and the peer groups of companies. For each simulation, the total shareholder return of PotlatchDeltic is ranked against that of the peer groups of companies. The future value of the performance share unit is calculated based on a multiplier for the median outperformance and percentile ranking and then discounted to present value. The discount rate is the risk-free rate as of the award date for a term consistent with the performance period. Awards are also credited with dividend equivalents at the end of the performance period, and as a result, award values are not adjusted for dividends.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
During 2024, 2023 and 2022, directors, officers, and certain other employees of the company were granted RSU awards that will vest from 
one
 to 
three years
. RSU awards are credited with dividend equivalents for any dividends paid on the company's common stock during the vesting period. Recipients will receive dividend equivalents in the form of additional shares of common stock at the date the vested RSUs are settled. Any forfeited RSUs will not receive dividends. Therefore, the shares are not considered participating securities.

DEFERRED COMPENSATION STOCK EQUIVALENT UNITS
A long-term incentive award was granted annually to our directors through December 2017. The awards are payable on or after a director's separation from service (subject to the terms of the director's deferral election). Directors may also ele
ct to defer their annual cash retainers and awards of RSUs, payable in the form of stock. Additionally, issuance of RSUs awarded to certain officers and employees may also be deferred at the election of the officers or employees, as applicable. All stock unit equivalent accounts are credited with dividend equivalents. At December 31, 2024, vested deferred shares that will be distributed in the future to directors or officers and employees as common stock were

NOTE 1
4.  INCOME TAXES
As a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal and state corporate income taxes on income from investments in real estate that we distribute to our shareholders. We conduct certain activities through our PotlatchDeltic TRS which are subject to corporate level federal and state income taxes. These activities are principally comprised of our wood products manufacturing operations and certain real estate investments. Therefore, income tax expense or benefit is primarily due to income or loss of the PotlatchDeltic TRS, as well as permanent book versus tax differences and discrete items.
We were also subject to corporate taxes on built-in gains (the excess of fair market value over tax basis on the merger date) on sales of former Deltic real property held by the REIT during the five years following the Deltic merger (until February 2023). The sale of standing timber is not subject to built-in gains tax.

The state NOL carryforwards total is made up of several jurisdictions that expire over various times. A portion of the state NOLs were acquired in the CatchMark merger have been reduced for Section 382 limitations under the Internal Revenue Code, and are netted against corresponding uncertain tax position liabilities. No state NOL is set to expire before December 31, 2032.

In conjunction with the CatchMark merger, we recorded uncertain tax position liabilities plus any applicable accrued interest, related to the treatment of certain intercompany transactions between CatchMark's REIT and its taxable REIT subsidiary. These liabilities are included in Other long-term obligations and Deferred tax liabilities, net in our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $
6.3
 million and $
7.8
 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits, most of which, if recognized, would affect the annual effective tax rate.

NOTE 15.  SAVINGS PLANS, PEN
SION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
SAVINGS PLANS
Substantially all of our employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) savings plans sponsored by the company. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, we made employer matching 401(k) contributions on behalf of our employees of $
4.6
 million,  $
4.3
 million, and $
4.2
 million, respectively.
Certain eligible employees who earn awards under our annual incentive plan are permitted to defer receipt of those awards. These employees may defer up to 
90
% of their award pursuant to rules established under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan. Eligible employees may also defer up to 
50
% of their base salary under the Management Deferred Compensation Plan. At the employee's election, deferrals may be deemed invested in a directed investment account with certain deemed investments available under the 401(k) savings plans or a combination of these investment vehicles.

PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
On January 1, 2011, we closed the legacy Potlatch pension plans to any new salaried and hourly non-represented employees hired after that date. Upon our merger with Deltic in 2018, we assumed one qualified pension plan, one nonqualified pension plan and one other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plan. The acquired plans have been frozen to new participants since 2014. Effective December 31, 2021, the Potlatch Salaried Retirement Plan (Salaried Plan) was amended and restated merging the company's three other qualified pension plans into the Salaried Plan, creating one qualified pension plan renamed the PotlatchDeltic Retirement Plan. There were no impacts to vesting provisions or benefits to the participants of the former qualified defined benefit pension plans as a result of the merger into the Salaried Plan.

78

Table of Contents

In March 2022, we transferred $
75.6
 million of our qualified pension plan 
(the Plan) assets
 to an insurance company for the purchase of a group annuity contract. As a result of the transaction, the insurance company assumed responsibility for annuity administration and benefit payments to select retirees and terminated vested participants, with 
no
 change to participants' pension benefits. We recorded a non-cash pretax settlement charge of $
14.2
 million as a result of accelerating the recognition of actuarial losses included in Accumulated other comprehensive income that would have been recognized in future periods. The settlement triggered a remeasurement of the Plan's assets and liabilities. We updated the discount rate used to measure our projected benefit obligation for the Plan as of March 31, 2022, and to calculate the related net periodic benefit cost for the remainder of 2022 to 
3.95
% from 
3.00
%. All other pension assumptions remained unchanged.

Certain legacy Potlatch and Deltic retirees under age 65 are offered a PPO medical plan with prescription drug coverage. Certain legacy Deltic retirees over age 65 are offered a PPO medical plan with no prescription drug coverage. This plan is considered a secondary plan to Medicare. For legacy Potlatch retirees age 65 or over, the medical plan is divided into two components, with the company continuing to self-insure prescription drugs and providing a fully-insured medical supplemental plan through AARP/United Healthcare. The health care plans require the retiree to contribute amounts in excess of the company subsidy in order to continue coverage.

We use a December 31 measurement date for our benefit plans and obligations. We recognize the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans and OPEB plan obligations on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets
. We recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which changes occur in Accumulated other comprehensive income and amortize actuarial gains and losses in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations
 as net periodic cost (benefit).
Changes in benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status for our pension and OPEB plans were as follows for the year ended December 31:

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans is determined using the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which the employee is currently entitled and the employee’s expected date of separation for retirement. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans w
as $
224.4
 million and $
223.5
 million, respectively. Actuarial gain (loss) in our pension plans is primarily due to year-over-yea
r changes in the discount rate and assumptions associated with updated census data, demographic assumptions, future salary increases, along with asset growth outpacing interest and service cost in our qualified pension plan. Actuarial gain (loss) for our OPEB plans is primarily due to year-over-year changes in the discount rate and assumptions associated with medical trends, claims and participant contributions. During 2024 and 2023, funding of our non-qualified pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans was $
4.6
 million and $
3.3
 million, respectively. During 2024 and 2023, we made contributions to our qualified pension benefit plan of $
4.0
 million and $
0
, respectively.

PENSION ASSETS
We utilize formal investment policy guidelines for our company-sponsored pension plan assets. Management is responsible for ensuring the investment policy and guidelines are adhered to and the investment objectives are met.
The general policy states that plan assets will be invested to seek the greatest return consistent with the fiduciary character of the pension funds and to allow the plans to meet the need for timely pension benefit payments. The specific investment guidelines stipulate that management will maintain adequate liquidity for meeting expected benefit payments by reviewing, on a timely basis, contribution and benefit payment levels and appropriately revise long-term and short-term asset allocations. Management takes reasonable and prudent steps to preserve the value of pension fund assets and to avoid the risk of large losses. Major steps taken to provide this protection include the following:
•
Assets are diversified among various asset classes, such as global equities, fixed income, alternatives and liquid reserves. 
•
Periodic reviews of allocations within these ranges are reviewed to determine what adjustments should be made based on changing economic and market conditions and specific liquidity requirements. 
•
Assets are managed by professional investment managers and may be invested in separately managed accounts or commingled funds. 
•
Assets are not invested in PotlatchDeltic stock. 
The investment guidelines also provide that individual investment managers are expected to achieve a reasonable rate of return over a market cycle. Emphasis will be placed on long-term performance versus short-term market aberrations. Factors to be considered in determining reasonable rates of return include performance achieved by a diverse cross section of other investment managers, performance of commonly used benchmarks (e.g., MSCI All-Country World Index, Barclays Long Credit Index), actuarial assumptions for return on plan investments and specific performance guidelines given to individual investment managers.
The long-term targeted asset allocation ranges for the PotlatchDeltic Retirement Plans’ asset categories are as follows:

1.

At December 31, 2024, three collective investment funds held substantially all of the pension plan funds. These funds have diversified holdings among various asset classes and allocation ranges approved by the Benefits Committee. These funds are generally valued based on their respective net asset value (or its equivalent) provided by the fund administrator as a practical expedient to estimate fair value due to the absence of a readily determinable fair value. These values represent the per-unit price at which new investors are permitted to invest and existing investors are permitted to exit. The collective investment funds may be redeemed daily with limited notice. At December 31, 2023, there were no collective investment funds held by the Plan.

2.

Level 1 assets are international and domestic managed investments with quoted prices on major security markets and also include investments in registered investment company funds for which market quotations are generally readily available on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded. The global equity securities track the MSCI All-Country World Index.

3.

Level 1 assets are investments in a diversified portfolio of fixed income instruments of varying maturities representing corporate securities, U.S. treasuries, municipals and futures. Level 2 assets are thinly traded investments in a diversified portfolio of fixed income instruments of varying maturities representing mostly corporate securities. Both Level 1 & Level 2 investments track the Bloomberg Barclay’s Long-term Credit Index.

4.

Level 1 assets are long-term investment funds which are invested in tangible assets and real asset companies such as infrastructure, natural resources and timber.

There were 
no
 Level 3 investments held by the 
PotlatchDeltic Retirement Plan at December 31, 2024 or 2023.

EXPECTED FUNDING AND BENEFIT PAYMENTS
We currently estimate we will contribute approximately $

The discount rate used in the determination of pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations was calculated using hypothetical bond portfolios to match the expected benefit payments under each of our pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit obligations based on bonds available at each year end with a rating of "AA" or better. The portfolios were well-diversified over corporate industrial, corporate financial, municipal, federal and foreign government issuers.
Determining our expected return on plan assets requires a high degree of judgment. The expected return on plan assets assumption is based upon an analysis of historical long-term returns for various investment categories, as measured by appropriate indices. These indices are weighted based upon the extent to which plan assets are invested in the particular categories in arriving at our determination of a composite expected return.
At December 31,
 2024, the assumed health-care cost trend rate used to calculate other postretirement employee benefit obligations was between 
6.02
% and 
9.91
% depending on the individual plan participant makeup and graded ratably to an assumption of 
4.00
% in 2049. The actual rates of health-care cost increases may vary significantly from the assumption used because of unanticipated changes 
in health-care costs.

ITEM 9.  CHANGES

Not applicable.
ITEM 9A.  CONT
ROLS AND PROCEDURES
We conducted an evaluation (pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act)), under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2024. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act of 1934.

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 
Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)
.
Based on our assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the latest fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors

PotlatchDeltic Corporation:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited PotlatchDeltic Corporation and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 13, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
