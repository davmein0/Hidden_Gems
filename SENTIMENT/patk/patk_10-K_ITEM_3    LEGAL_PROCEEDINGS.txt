EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Overview of Markets and Related Industry Performance
Recreational Vehicle ("RV") Industry

The RV industry is our primary market and comprised 44% and 43% of the Company’s consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net sales to the RV industry increased 8% for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023. Following a dealer inventory restocking in the first half of 2024, OEMs reduced production slightly in the second half of 2024 as retail demand decreased, with dealers managing inventory levels and the OEMs demonstrating operating discipline to maintain a balanced inventory channel for the long-term health and stability of the industry.
According to the RV Industry Association (“RVIA”), RV industry wholesale unit shipments totaled approximately 333,700 units in 2024, an increase of 7% from approximately 313,200 units in 2023. According to Statistical Surveys, Inc. ("SSI"), RV industry retail unit sales totaled approximately 352,700 units in 2024, a decrease of 7% from approximately 380,700 units in 2023. 
Marine Industry 
Net sales to the marine industry comprised approximately 15% and 23% of the Company's consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net sales to the marine industry in the year ended December 31, 2024 decreased 27% compared to 2023. The decrease in net sales to the marine industry was in line with the decrease in wholesale powerboat unit shipments.
Our marine revenue is generally correlated to marine wholesale powerboat unit shipments. According to Company estimates based on data published by the National Marine Manufacturers Association ("NMMA"), wholesale powerboat unit shipments totaled approximately 143,900 units in 2024, a decrease of 25% compared to 192,300 units in 2023. According to SSI, we estimate marine retail powerboat shipments totaled approximately 165,000 units in 2024, a decrease of 8% from approximately 179,500 units in 2023. 
Powersports Industry
Through acquisitions completed in recent years, the Company entered the powersports end market. Previously, our sales to the powersports end market were included in the Company’s marine end market sales. Effective with the first quarter of 2024, powersports net sales are being reported separately after the January 2024 acquisition of Sportech, LLC (“Sportech”), as disclosed in Note 2 "Revenue Recognition" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.
Net sales to the powersports industry comprised approximately 10% and 4% of the Company's consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net sales to the powersports industry increased 189% during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in net sales for this period is primarily attributable to the Company's acquisition of Sportech in January 2024.
Manufactured Housing ("MH") Industry
Net sales to the MH industry comprised approximately 18% and 16% of the Company's consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net sales to the MH industry increased 20% during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023. MH sales are generally correlated to MH industry wholesale unit shipments. According to Company estimates based on industry data from the Manufactured Housing Institute, MH industry wholesale unit shipments totaled approximately 103,300 units in 2024, an increase of 16% compared to 89,200 units in 2023, primarily driven by OEMs increasing production from significantly reduced levels in 2023 in anticipation of a recovery in demand.
Industrial Market
The industrial market is comprised primarily of kitchen cabinet, countertop, hospitality, retail and commercial fixtures, and office and household furniture markets and regional distributors. Net sales to the industrial market comprised approximately 13% and 14% of the Company's consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net sales to the industrial market decreased 1% during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 2023. Overall, our revenues in these markets are focused on residential and multifamily housing, hospitality, high-rise housing and office, 
30
Table of Contents
commercial construction and institutional furniture markets. We estimate that approximately 75% to 85% of our industrial business is directly tied to the residential housing market, with the remaining industrial sales tied to the non-residential and commercial markets. 
During the year ended December 31, 2024, combined new housing starts decreased 4% compared to 2023, reflecting a decrease in multifamily housing starts of 25%, partially offset by an increase in single-family housing starts of 6%. Our industrial products are generally among the last components installed in new unit construction and as such our related sales typically trail new housing starts by four to six months.

Compared to 2023 
Net Sales.
 Net sales in 2024 increased approximately $247.6 million, or 7%, to $3.72 billion compared to $3.47 billion in 2023. Net sales in 2024 increased due to increased sales to the powersports, RV and MH markets, partially offset by decreased sales to the marine and industrial markets. The Company's sales to the powersports market increased $230.3 million, or 189%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to the Company’s acquisition of Sportech in the first quarter of 2024. Sales to the RV market increased $121.9 million, or 8%, to $1.63 billion in 2024 compared to $1.50 billion in 2023, due to industry volume growth and the Company’s acquisition of ICON Direct LLC which does business as RecPro (“RecPro”) in the third quarter of 2024. Sales to the MH market increased $113.9 million, or 20%, to $682.1 million in 2024 compared to $568.2 million in 2023, primarily due to an increase in estimated MH industry wholesale unit shipments of approximately 16%. Sales to the marine market decreased $211.9 million, or 27%, to $570.7 million in 2024 compared to $782.6 million in 2023 primarily attributable to a decrease in estimated powerboat wholesale unit shipments of 25% compared to 2023. Sales to the industrial market decreased $6.5 million, or 1%, compared to 2023.
In 
2024
 and 
2023
, net sales attributable to acquisitions completed in each of those years was 
$295.7 million
 and 
$17.7 million
, respectively. 
Cost of Goods Sold.
 Cost of goods sold increased $194.0 million, or 7%, to $2.88 billion in 2024 compared to $2.69 billion in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, cost of goods sold increased 10-basis points during 2024 to 77.5% compared to 77.4% in 2023. 
Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of a 50-basis point increase in overhead as a percentage of net sales due to higher research and development costs, partially offset by a 40-basis point decrease in labor as a percentage of net sales. In general, the Company's cost of goods sold percentage can be impacted from period-to-period by demand changes in certain market sectors that can result in fluctuating costs of certain raw materials and commodity-based components that are utilized in production.

Table of Contents
Gross Profit.
 Gross profit increased $53.7 million or 7%, to $835.9 million in 2024 compared to $782.2 million in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased to 22.5% in 2024 compared to 22.6% in 2023. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in 2024 compared to 2023 reflects the impact of the factors discussed above under “Cost of Goods Sold”. 
Economic or industry-wide factors affecting the profitability of our sales to the RV, marine, powersports, MH and industrial markets include the costs of commodities and supply chain constraints and the labor used to manufacture our products, the competitive environment and the impact of different gross margin profiles of acquired companies, all of which can cause gross margins to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.
Warehouse and Delivery Expenses.
 Warehouse and delivery expenses increased $11.9 million, or 8%, to $155.8 million in 2024 compared to $143.9 million in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, warehouse and delivery expenses increased 10 basis points to 4.2% in 2024 compared to 4.1% in 2023. 
The increase in warehouse and delivery expenses in 2024 compared to 2023 is primarily attributable to the increase in sales, and the increase as a percentage of net sales is primarily related to an increase in certain expenses that are fixed in nature, including fleet and insurance expenses.
Selling, General and Administrative ("SG&A") Expenses.
 SG&A expenses increased $26.3 million, or 9%, to $325.8 million in 2024 compared to $299.4 million in 2023. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 8.8% in 2024 and 8.6% in 2023.
The increase in SG&A expenses in 2024 compared to 2023 is primarily due to increased wages, $5.0 million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Sportech, increased technology expenses and the $2.5 million write-off of deferred financing costs due to early payment debt, partially offset by decreased incentive compensation and insurance expenses. 
The increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2024 compared to 2023 is primarily attributable to the Sportech acquisition-related costs, increased technology expenses and deferred financing costs write-off mentioned above, partially offset by decreased incentive compensation, wages and insurance expenses. Additionally, certain 2023 and 2024 acquisitions operate with comparatively higher SG&A as a percentage of sales when compared to the consolidated percentage.
Amortization of Intangible Assets.
 Amortization of intangible assets increased $17.6 million, or 22%, in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily reflect the impact of the Sportech acquisition as well as other acquisitions completed in 2024 and 2023.
Operating Income.
 Operating income decreased $2.2 million, or 1%, to $258.0 million in 2024 compared to $260.2 million in 2023. Operating income in 2024 and 2023 included $47.2 million and $1.0 million, respectively, from the businesses acquired in each respective year. Operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points to 6.9% in 2024 compared to 7.5% in 2023. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to the items discussed above. 
Interest Expense, Net.
 Interest expense, net, increased $10.5 million, or 15%, to $79.5 million in 2024 compared to $68.9 million in 2023. The increase primarily reflects interest associated with the issuance of our 6.375% Senior Notes due 2032 (the “6.375% Senior Notes”) in October 2024, higher debt levels and higher interest rates on our term loan and revolver balances.
Income Taxes. 
Income tax expense decreased $8.2 million, or 17%, to $40.2 million in 2024 compared to $48.4 million in 2023 as a result of the decrease in pre-tax income and a decrease in the effective tax rate. For 2024, the effective tax rate was 22.5% compared to 25.3% in 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2024 is primarily related to increased excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. 
BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
The Company's reportable segments, manufacturing and distribution, are based on its method of internal reporting. The Company regularly evaluates the performance of the manufacturing and distribution segments and allocates resources to them based on a variety of indicators including net sales and operating income.

Compared to 2023 
Manufacturing
Sales.
 Manufacturing sales increased $103.2 million, or 4%, to $2.76 billion in 2024 compared to $2.65 billion in 2023. The manufacturing segment accounted for approximately 74% of the Company’s consolidated net sales in 2024 compared to approximately 75% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2023. 
Manufacturing segment sales in 2024 compared to 2023 increased due to increased sales to the powersports, MH and RV markets, partially offset by decreased sales to the marine and industrial markets. Sales to the powersports market increased 210% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to the Company’s acquisition of Sportech in the first quarter of 2024. Sales to the MH market increased 16% compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in estimated MH industry wholesale unit shipments of approximately 16%. Sales to the RV market increased 10% compared to 2023, due to industry volume growth. Sales to the marine market decreased 29% compared to 2023, primarily attributable to a decrease in estimated powerboat wholesale unit shipments of 25%. Sales to the industrial market decreased 2% compared to 2023.
For 2024 and 2023, manufacturing segment sales attributable to acquisitions completed in each of those years were $275.4 million and $3.6 million, respectively.
Gross Profit.
 Manufacturing segment gross profit increased $35.3 million, or 6%, to $612.6 million in 2024 compared to $577.3 million in 2023. As a percentage of sales, gross profit increased 40 basis points to 22.2% in 2024 compared to 21.8% in 2023. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales in 2024 compared to 2023 is attributable to decreases in material and labor costs as a percentage of sales, partially offset by increased overhead costs as a percentage of sales.
Operating Income.
 Manufacturing segment operating income increased $19.9 million, or 6%, to $341.0 million in 2024 compared to $321.1 million in 2023. Manufacturing segment operating income in 2024 attributable to acquisitions completed in such year was approximately $46.5 million and manufacturing segment operating loss in 2023 attributable to acquisitions completed in such year was $(0.6) million. The increase in operating income in 2024 primarily reflects the items discussed above.

Distribution
Sales.
 Distribution sales increased $90.7 million, or 10%, to $980.1 million in 2024 compared to $889.4 million in 2023. The distribution segment accounted for approximately 26% of the Company’s consolidated net sales for 2024 compared to 25% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2023. 
Distribution segment sales in 2024 compared to 2023 increased due to increased sales to all five of our end markets. Sales to the MH market increased 23% compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in estimated MH industry wholesale unit shipments of approximately 16%. Sales to the powersports market increased 6% compared to 2023, primarily attributable to product mix shifts by certain customers. Sales to the RV market increased 4% compared to 2023, primarily attributable to the Company’s acquisition of RecPro in the third quarter of 2024. Sales to the marine market increased 3% compared to 2023. Sales to the industrial market increased 2% compared to 2023, primarily reflecting product mix shifts by certain customers.
For 2024 and 2023, distribution segment sales attributable to acquisitions completed in each of those years were $20.3 million and $14.1 million, respectively.
Gross Profit.
 Distribution segment gross profit increased $29.4 million, or 15%, to $224.9 million in 2024 compared to $195.5 million in 2023. As a percentage of sales, gross profit increased 90 basis points 22.9% in 2024 compared to 22.0% in 2023. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for 2024 is primarily attributed to decreases in material and labor costs as a percentage of net sales.
Operating Income.
 Distribution segment operating income increased $14.6 million, or 16%, to $104.7 million in 2024 compared to $90.1 million in 2023. For 2024 and 2023 distribution segment operating income attributable to acquisitions completed in each of those years was immaterial. The increase in operating income in 2024 primarily reflects the items discussed above.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
Our liquidity requirements are primarily to support working capital demands, meet debt service requirements and support the Company's capital allocation strategy, which includes acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividends and repurchases of the Company’s common stock, among others. The Company's primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, which includes selling its products and collecting receivables, available cash reserves and borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit and term loan facility (the “2024 Credit Facility”) as discussed in Note 7 "Debt" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
During 2024, we expanded our access to capital and reduced our cost of debt by issuing $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes. The proceeds from the issuance, together with borrowings under the 2024 Credit Facility, were utilized to redeem all $300 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 7.50% Senior Notes due 2027 (the “7.50% Senior Notes”), to repay all borrowings under its existing senior secured credit facility and to pay related fees and expenses, as discussed in Note 7 "Debt" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
.
As of December 31, 2024, our liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $33.6 million and $770.0 million of availability under our 2024 Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2024, the Company's existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and available borrowings under its 2024 Credit Facility are expected to be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months, exclusive of any acquisitions, based on its current cash flow budgets and forecast of short-term and long-term liquidity needs.
Working capital requirements vary from period to period depending on manufacturing volumes primarily related to the RV, marine, powersports, MH and industrial markets we serve, the timing of deliveries, and the payment cycles of customers. In the event that operating cash flow is inadequate and one or more of the Company's capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would seek to revise its operating strategies accordingly. The Company will continue to assess its liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $81.9 million, or 20%, to $326.8 million in 2024 compared to $408.7 million in 2023. The decrease in operating cash flows is primarily attributable to a decrease in operating assets and liabilities, net of business acquisitions, as a source of cash of $93.3 million, from $98.9 million in 2023 compared to $5.6 million in 2024, a decrease in net income of $4.5 million and an increase in deferred income taxes of $5.9 million, partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense of $22.0 million and loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.5 million.
Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities increased $426.3 million, to $512.8 million in 2024 compared to $86.5 million in 2023 primarily due to an increase in cash used in business acquisitions, which were $411.7 million in 2024, primarily due to the acquisitions of Sportech and RecPro, compared to $25.9 million in 2023, an increase in cash used for capital expenditures of $16.7 million and an increase in other investing activities of $24.7 million.
Financing Activities

Net cash flows provided by financing activities was $208.2 million in 2024 compared to net cash flows used in financing activities of $333.6 million in 2023. The change in cash flow from financing activities was primarily due to net borrowings of $100 million under the Revolver due 2029 and proceeds from the issuance of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% Senior Notes in 2024 and compared to cash used in 2023 to redeem the $172.5 million 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023, partially offset by the redemption of the $300 million 7.50% Senior Notes in 2024.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
None.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, and which require the Company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Although management believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available when they are made. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company has identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates:

Table of Contents
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. 
The Company’s acquisitions include purchased goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Other intangible assets acquired are classified as customer relationships, non-compete agreements, patents and trademarks. 
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, representing acquired trademarks, are not amortized but are subject to an annual (or under certain circumstances more frequent) impairment test in the fourth quarter based on their estimated fair value. We test more frequently, if there are indicators of impairment, or whenever such circumstances suggest that the carrying value of goodwill or trademarks may not be recoverable. These indicators include a sustained material decline in our share price and market capitalization, a decline in expected future cash flows, or a material adverse change in the business climate. A material adverse change in the business climate could result in a material loss of market share or the inability to achieve previously projected revenue growth. 
Impairment reviews of goodwill are performed at the reporting unit level. The Company’s reporting units are defined as one level below our operating segments, Manufacturing and Distribution, which are the same as our reportable segments. In evaluating goodwill for impairment, either a qualitative or quantitative assessment is performed. The Company performed a quantitative assessment for all reporting units in 2024. When estimating reporting unit fair value with a quantitative assessment, the Company uses a combination of market and income-based methodologies. The market approach includes a comparison of the multiple of a reporting unit's carrying value to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization with the multiples of similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in the public markets. When calculating the present value of future cash flows under the income approach, the Company takes into consideration multiple variables, including forecasted sales volumes and operating income, current industry and economic conditions, and historical results. The income approach fair value estimate also includes estimates of long-term growth rates and discount rates that are commensurate with the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting units and internally-developed forecasts. 
Impairment reviews of indefinite-lived intangible assets (trademarks) consist of a comparison of the fair value of the trademark to its carrying value. Fair value is measured using a relief-from-royalty approach, a form of discounted cash flow method. Estimated royalty rates applied to projected revenues are based on comparable industry studies and consideration of operating margins. Discount rates are derived in a manner similar to what is done in testing goodwill for impairment. 
Based on the results of the Company's analyses, the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units and trademarks was determined to exceed the carrying value for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and so no impairments were recognized. Further, based on the results of the impairment analyses, none of the Company’s reporting units or trademarks were at risk of failing the impairment assessments discussed above that would have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for any period presented.
Business Combinations. 
From time to time, we may enter into business combinations. We recognize the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. We measure goodwill as the excess of consideration transferred, which we also measure at fair value, over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values of property, plant and equipment, identifiable intangible assets, contingent consideration and other financial assets and liabilities. Significant estimates and assumptions include subjective and/or complex judgments regarding items such as discount rates, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, and other factors, including estimated future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. 
The acquisition method of accounting also requires us to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. No changes in the year ended December 31, 2024 to provisional fair value estimates of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions were material. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop the acquisition date fair value estimates, we could record future impairment charges. In addition, we estimate the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be increased or decreased, or the acquired assets could be impaired.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Debt

Obligations
As of December 31, 2024, our total debt obligations under our 2024 Credit Agreement were under Secured Overnight Financing Rate Data ("SOFR")-based interest rates. A 100-basis point increase in the underlying SOFR rates would result in additional annual interest cost of approximately $2.2 million, assuming average borrowings during 2024, including the Revolver due 2029 and Term Loan due 2029, subject to variable rates were equal to the amount of such borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2024, or $223.4 million, excluding deferred financing costs related to the Revolver due 2029 and Term Loan due 2029.
Commodity Volatility
The prices of key raw materials, consisting primarily of lauan, gypsum, fiberglass, particleboard, aluminum, softwoods and hardwoods lumber, resin, and petroleum-based products, are influenced by demand and other factors specific to these commodities as well as general inflationary pressures, including those driven by supply chain and logistical disruptions. Prices of certain commodities have historically been volatile and continued to fluctuate in 2024. During periods of volatile commodity prices, we have generally been able to pass both price increases and decreases to our customers in the form of price adjustments. We are exposed to risks during periods of commodity volatility because there can be no assurance future cost increases or decreases, if any, can be partially or fully passed on to customers, or that the timing of such sales price increases or decreases will match raw material cost increases or decreases. We do not believe that commodity price volatility had a material effect on results of operations for the periods presented.
Equity Price Risk
The fair value of the 1.75% Convertible Notes is subject to market risk and other factors due to the conditional conversion feature. The fair value of the 1.75% Convertible Notes will generally increase as our common stock price increases and will generally decrease as our common stock price decreases. The 1.75% Convertible Notes are carried at amortized cost and their fair value is presented for disclosure purposes only.
The Company will satisfy any conversion by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 1.75% Convertible Notes to be converted and by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at its election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 1.75% Convertible Notes being converted.
In connection with the pricing of the 1.75% Convertible Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with certain of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates (the “option counterparties”). At the same time, we entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the 1.75% Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, as the case may be. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants. See Note 9 "Derivative Financial Instruments" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for further discussion.

ITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
The Company maintains “disclosure controls and procedures”, as such term is defined under Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, the Company’s management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and the Company’s management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information relating to the Company, including consolidated subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to Company’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the fair and reliable preparation and presentation of our published financial statements. We continually evaluate our system of internal control over financial reporting to determine if changes are appropriate based upon changes in our operations or the business environment in which we operate.
All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). This assessment included a review of the documentation of controls, an assessment of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls, and a conclusion on this evaluation. As permitted under SEC guidance, management’s assessment of and conclusion regarding the design and effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal control over financial reporting of the operations of businesses acquired in 2024, which are described in Note 3 "Acquisitions" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Businesses acquired in 2024 represented approximately 8% of consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024 and approximately 3% of consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2024. Based on our assessment, we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, audited our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, as stated in their report in the section entitled “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.
Changes in internal control over financial reporting
There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2024 or subsequent to the date the Company completed its evaluation, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Patrick Industries, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Patrick Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. 
As described in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at the operations of businesses acquired in 2024, which are described in Note 3, whose financial statements constitute less than 8% of consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024 and approximately 3% of consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2024. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at these businesses.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the 
F-2
Table of Contents
company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matter 
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Acquisitions - Sportech - Customer Relationships and Trademark Intangible Assets - Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements 
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company completed the acquisition of Sportech for approximately $319 million in January 2024. The Company accounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including a customer relationships intangible asset and a trademark intangible asset of $152 million and $21 million, respectively. Management estimated the fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset using the multi-period excess earnings method and the fair value of the trademark intangible asset using the relief-from-royalty method, both such methods being specific discounted cash flow methods. The fair value determination of these intangible assets required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to future cash flows, specifically revenue growth and profit margins, and the selection of the discount rates and, specifically for the trademark intangible asset, the selection of the royalty rate.
We identified these intangible assets for Sportech as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management made to fair value these assets. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s valuation methodologies, forecasts of future cash flows, specifically revenue growth and profit margins, and the selection of the discount rates and, for the trademark intangible asset, the royalty rate.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the valuation methodologies, the forecasts of future cash flows, specifically revenue growth and profit margins, and the selection of the discount rates and trademark intangible asset royalty rate included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation of the customer relationships and trademark intangible assets, including management’s controls over the valuation methodologies, forecasts of future cash flows, specifically revenue growth and profit margins, and selection of the discount rates and trademark intangible asset royalty rate.
•
We assessed the reasonableness of management’s forecast of future cash flows, specifically revenue growth and profit margins, by comparing the projections to historical results and certain peer companies. 
•
With the assistance of our internal fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodologies, discount rates, and trademark intangible asset royalty rate by:
◦
Assessing whether the selected valuation methodologies align with generally accepted valuation methodologies.
◦
Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rates and trademark intangible asset royalty rate.

◦
Testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.
◦
Developing ranges of independent estimates and comparing those to the rates selected by management.

PATRICK INDUSTRIES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1.    
BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Nature of Business
Patrick Industries, Inc. (“Patrick” or the “Company”) operations consist of the manufacture and distribution of component products and materials for use primarily by the recreational vehicle (“RV”), marine, powersports, manufactured housing (“MH”) and industrial markets for customers throughout the United States and Canada. As of December 31, 2024, the Company maintained approximately 
179
 manufacturing plants and 
47
 distribution facilities located in 
25
 states with a small presence in Mexico, China and Canada. Patrick operates in 
two
 business segments: Manufacturing and Distribution.
Reclassified Amounts
Certain amounts have been reclassified in prior years' financial statements to conform with current year presentation. These reclassifications are immaterial to the overall financial statements.
Previously, our sales to the powersports end market were included in the Company’s marine end market sales.
 Effective with the first quarter of 2024, powersports net sales are being reported separately after the January 2024 acquisition of Sportech, LLC, as disclosed in Note 2 "Revenue Recognition".
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Patrick and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates include the valuation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the valuation of long-lived assets, the allowance for credit losses, excess and obsolete inventories, assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, the valuation of estimated contingent consideration, deferred tax asset valuation allowances, and certain accrued liabilities. Actual results could differ from the amounts reported.
Revenue Recognition   
The Company is a major manufacturer and distributor of component products and materials serving original equipment manufacturers and other customers in the RV, marine, powersports, MH, and industrial industries. Revenue is recognized when or as control of the promised goods transfers to the Company's customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods. The Company’s contracts typically consist of a single performance obligation to manufacture and provide the promised goods. To the extent a contract is deemed to have multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price of the contract to each performance obligation using the standalone selling price of each distinct good in the contract. The transaction price for contracts may include reductions to the transaction price for estimated volume discounts and rebates and other customer incentives. There are no material instances in any period presented where variable consideration was constrained and not recorded at the initial time of sale.
Manufacturing segment revenue is recognized when control of the products transfers to the customer which is the point when the customer gains the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from the asset, which is generally upon delivery of goods, or upon shipment of goods in certain circumstances. In limited circumstances, where the products are customer specific with no alternative use to the Company, and the Company has a legally enforceable right to payment for performance to date with a reasonable margin, revenue is recognized over the contract term based on the cost-to-
F-10
Table of Contents
cost method. However, the financial impact of these contracts is immaterial considering the short production cycles and limited inventory days on hand. 
Distribution segment revenue from product sales is recognized on a gross basis upon shipment or delivery of goods at which point control transfers to the customer. The Company acts as a principal in such arrangements because it controls the promised goods before delivery to the customer. The Company uses direct shipment arrangements with certain vendors and suppliers to deliver products to its customers without having to physically hold the inventory at its warehouses. The Company is the principal in the transaction and recognizes revenue for direct shipment arrangements on a gross basis. Our role as principal in our distribution sales is generally characterized by (i) customers entering into contracts with the Company, not the vendor; (ii) our obligation to pay the vendor irrespective of our ability to collect from the customer; (iii) our discretion in determining the price of the good provided to the customer; (iv) our title to the goods before the customer receives or accept the goods; and (v) our responsibility for the quality and condition of goods delivered to the customer.
Sales and other taxes collected concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from net sales. 
The Company records freight billed to customers in net sales. The corresponding costs incurred for shipping and handling related to these customer-billed freight costs are accounted for as costs to fulfill the contract and are included in warehouse and delivery expenses.
The Company’s contracts across each of its businesses typically do not result in situations where there is a time period greater than one year between performance under the contract and collection of the related consideration. The Company does not account for a significant financing component when the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between the Company's transfer of a promised good or service to a customer and the customer’s payment for that good or service will be one year or less.
The Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the incurred costs that the Company otherwise would have capitalized is one year or less. These costs, representing primarily sales commissions, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
The Company does not disclose information about the transaction price being allocated to the remaining performance obligations at period end, as the Company does not have material contracts that have original expected durations of more than one year.
Contract liabilities, representing upfront payments from customers received prior to satisfying performance obligations, were immaterial in all periods presented and changes in contract liabilities were immaterial in all periods presented.
Contract assets, representing the Company’s rights to consideration for work completed but not billed (generally in conjunction with contracts for which revenue is recognized over time), were immaterial in all periods presented.

Costs and Expenses
Cost of goods sold includes material costs, direct and indirect labor, depreciation, overhead expenses, inbound freight charges, inspection costs, internal transfer costs, receiving costs, and other costs.
Warehouse and delivery expenses include salaries and wages, building rent and insurance, and other overhead costs related to distribution operations and delivery costs related to the shipment of finished and distributed products to customers.
Stock Based Compensation
Compensation expense related to the fair value of restricted stock awards as of the grant date is calculated based on the Company’s closing stock price on the date of grant. In addition, the Company estimates the fair value of all stock option and stock appreciation ri
ghts (“SARS”) awards as of the grant date by applying the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The use of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense, including the expected option term, dividend yield, risk-free interest rate and volatility of the Company's common stock. Expected volatilities take into consideration the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The expected term of options and SARS represents the period of time that the options and SARS granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical Company trends. The risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Trea
sury yield curve in effect at the time 
F-11

of grant for instruments of a similar term. New shares are issued upon exercise of options. Forfeitures of stock based compensation are recognized as incurred.

Earnings Per Common Share
Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income available for diluted shares (calculated as net income plus the after-tax effect of interest on potentially dilutive convertible notes, where applicable) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, plus the weighted-average impact of potentially dilutive convertible notes, plus the dilutive effect of stock options, SARS, and certain restricted stock awards (collectively, “Common Stock Equivalents”). The dilutive effect of Common Stock Equivalents is calculated under the treasury stock method using the average market price for the period. Common Stock Equivalents are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share if their effect would be anti-dilutive. 
On November 18, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a three-for-two stock split of the Company's common stock, to be effected in the form of a stock dividend. Shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 29, 2024 received one additional share for every two shares held which was paid on December 13, 2024. The Company's stock began trading on a post-split basis on December 16, 2024. Cash paid in lieu of fractional shares was immaterial. All share and per share information has been updated on a retrospective basis for all periods presented
. 
See Note 13 "Earnings Per Common Share" for the calculation of both basic and diluted earnings per common share.
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. The Company held 
no
 cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Trade and Other Receivables  
Trade receivables consist primarily of amounts due to the Company from its normal business activities. In assessing the carrying value of its trade receivables, the Company estimates the recoverability by making assumptions based on historical and forward-looking factors, such as historical and anticipated customer performance, current overall and industry-specific economic conditions, historical write-off and collection experience, the level of past-due amounts, and specific risks identified in the trade receivables portfolio. Other receivables consist of employee advances, insurance claims, amounts owed from vendors pertaining to importation costs, and other miscellaneous items.

Inventories 
Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method or, for certain inventories, average costing method) and net realizable value. Based on the inventory aging and other considerations for realizable value, the Company writes down the carrying value to net realizable value where appropriate. The Company reviews inventory on-hand and records provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on current assessments of future demand, market conditions, and related management initiatives. The cost of manufactured inventories includes raw materials, inbound freight, labor and overhead. The Company’s distribution inventories include the cost of materials purchased for resale and inbound freight.

Property, Plant and Equipment 
The costs of major improvements that materially extend the useful life of property are capitalized. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation is determined based on a straight-line method over the assets' estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their useful lives or the related lease term.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets  
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to an annual impairment test based on their estimated fair value. The Company reviews goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in the fourth quarter, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired. The impairment test was performed on September 30, 2024.
In conducting its impairment testing, the Company estimates the fair value of our reporting units using both an income and market based approach and the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets using an income based approach. The market approach includes a comparison of multiples of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the reporting units to similar businesses or guideline companies whose securities are actively traded in public markets. The income approach calculates the present value of expected cash flows to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets. Additionally, the income approach requires us to estimate future cash flows, the timing of these cash flows, and a discount rate (based on a weighted average cost of capital), which represents the time value of money and the inherent risk and uncertainty of the future cash flows. Estimated royalty rates applied to projected revenues are based on comparable industry studies and consideration of operating margins. The assumptions we use to estimate future cash flows are consistent with the assumptions that our reporting units use for internal planning purposes. When calculating the present value of future cash flows under the income approach, we take into consideration multiple variables, including forecasted sales volumes and operating income, current industry and economic conditions, and historical results.
If we determine that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its carrying amount, the reporting unit's goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired. Our fourth quarter 2024 goodwill impairment test concluded that the fair values of each of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values. Our 2024 indefinite-lived intangibles test also concluded that the fair values of these intangibles exceeded their respective carrying values.

Long-Lived Assets

When events or conditions warrant, the Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which includes property, plant and equipment, finite-lived intangible assets, and lease right-of-use assets, and considers whether these assets are impaired. The Company assesses the recoverability of these assets based upon several factors, including management's intention with respect to the assets and their projected future undiscounted cash flows. If projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets, the Company adjusts the carrying amounts of such assets to their estimated fair value. A significant adverse change in the Company’s business climate in future periods could result in a significant loss of market share or the inability to achieve previously projected revenue growth and could lead to a required assessment of the recoverability of the Company’s long-lived assets, which may subsequently result in an impairment charge.

F-13
Table of Contents
Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives, as detailed further in Note 6 "Goodwill and Intangible Assets". 
Income Taxes

Income tax expense is calculated based on statutory tax rates of the federal, state, and international jurisdictions in which the Company operates and income earned or apportioned to each of these respective jurisdictions, as well as any additional tax planning available to the Company in these jurisdictions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. 
Deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability method whereby deferred taxes are recognized based on temporary differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized.
The Company reports a liability, if any, for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.
Leases
The Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at inception. For leases where the Company is the lessee, a lease liability and a right-of-use asset are recognized for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases with terms of twelve months or less. The lease liability represents the lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, and is measured as the present value of the lease payments. As the rate implicit in the lease is usually not known at lease commencement, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease obligation. The Company uses its best judgment when determining the incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term to the lease payments in a similar currency. The right-of-use asset represents the lessee’s right to use a specified asset for the lease term, and is measured at the lease liability amount, adjusted for lease prepayment, lease incentives received and the Company’s initial direct costs. Additionally, the Company has lease agreements containing lease and non-lease components which are accounted for as a single lease component.
 See Note 14 "Leases" for additional information. 
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Adoption of New Accounting Standards
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-07
, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures"
. This ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported measure of a segment's profit or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment’s profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of the ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company adopted the ASU during the year ended December 31, 2024 and applied the requirements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024 on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. The Company will begin to apply the disclosure requirements in interim periods beginning in 2025. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on Patrick’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 17 "Segment Reporting" for further detail.
Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted
In November 2024, the FASB" issued ASU 2024-03
, "Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses". 
The amendments in this update require public business entities to disclose, on an annual and interim basis, disaggregated information about certain income statement expense line items in the notes to the financial statements. Public business entities are required to apply the guidance prospectively or retrospectively. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is 
F-14
Table of Contents
currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of ASU 2024-03 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-04
, "Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20): Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments". 
The amendments in this update are intended to clarify disclosure requirements for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments should be accounted for as induced conversions rather than as debt extinguishments. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects that the adoption of ASU 2024-04 will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, "
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures". 
This ASU establishes new income tax disclosure requirements in addition to modifying and eliminating certain existing requirements. Under the new guidance, entities must consistently categorize and provide greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation. They must also further disaggregate income taxes paid. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with retrospective application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact on its disclosures; however, adoption will not impact our consolidated financial statements.

ACQUISITIONS
General

Business combinations generally take place to strengthen Patrick's positions in existing markets and increase its market share and per unit content, expand into additional markets, or gain key technology. Acquisitions meeting the definition of a business combination are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. For each acquisition, the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill, which generally represents the combined value of the Company’s existing purchasing, manufacturing, sales, and systems resources with the organizational talent and expertise of the acquired companies’ respective management teams to maximize efficiencies, market share growth and net income.
The Company completed the acquisitions representing business combinations discussed below
 during the years ended
 December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The acquisitions were funded through cash on hand or borrowings under the Company’s credit facility in existence at the time of acquisition. For each of the acquisitions discussed, we either acquired the assets and assumed the liabilities of the business, or acquired 
100
% of the equity interests. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the individual acquisitions were recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet at their estimated fair values as of the respective dates of acquisition. For each acquisition, the Company completes its allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities within a one-year measurement period. For those acquisitions where the purchase price allocation is provisional, which includes certain acquisitions completed in 2024, the Company is still in the process of finalizing the fair values of acquired intangible assets and fixed assets. 
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenue of approximately $
295.7
 million, $
17.7
 million and $
121.8
 million, respectively, was included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income pertaining to the businesses acquired in each such respective year.
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, operating income of approximately $
47.2
 million, $
1.0
 million and $
19.4
 million, respectively, was included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income pertaining to the businesses acquired in each such respective year. 
Acquisition-related costs associated with the businesses acquired in 2024 were $
5.0
 million. Acquisition-related costs associated with the businesses acquired in 2023 and 2022 were 
immaterial
 in each respective year.
Contingent Consideration
In connection with certain acquisitions, the Company is required to pay additional cash consideration to the sellers if certain financial results of the acquired businesses are achieved. The Company records a liability for the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration related to each of these acquisitions as part of the initial purchase price based on the present value of the expected future cash flows and the probability of future payments at the date of acquisition.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending aggregate fair values of the contingent consideration:

Table of Contents
We estimate the value of acquired property, plant, and equipment using a combination of the income, cost, and market approaches, such as estimates of future income growth, capitalization rates, discount rates, and capital expenditure needs of the acquired businesses.
We estimate the value of customer relationships using the multi-period excess earnings method, which is a variation of the income approach, calculating the present value of incremental after-tax cash flows attributable to the asset. Non-compete agreements are valued using a discounted cash flow approach, which is a variation of the income approach, with and without the individual counterparties to the non-compete agreements. Trademarks and patents are valued using the relief-from-royalty method, which applies an estimated royalty rate to forecasted future cash flows, discounted to present value.
The estimated useful life for customer relationships is 
10
 years. The estimated useful life for non-compete agreements is 
5
 years. The weighted average estimated useful life for patents is 
13
 years, ranging from 
10
 to 
18
 years. Trademarks have an indefinite useful life.

2021 Credit Facility
On August 11, 2022, the Company entered into the first amendment of its Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated April 20, 2021 (as amended, the “2021 Credit Agreement”), under which the senior secured credit facility was increased to $
925
 million from $
700
 million and the maturity date was extended to August 11, 2027 from April 20, 2026. Following this amendment, the senior credit facility under the 2021 Credit Agreement was comprised of a $
775
 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolver due 2027") and the remaining balance of the $
150
 million term loan (the "Term Loan due 2027" and together with the Revolver due 2027, the "2021 Credit Facility"). The Company recorded a $
0.3
 million write-off of deferred financing costs as a result of the amendment, which is included in "Selling, general and administrative" in the Company's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2022. Pursuant to the amendment, interest rates for borrowings under the 2021 Credit Agreement transitioned to a Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") based option from a London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") based option. During 2024, the Company entered into the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “2024 Credit Agreement”), and used borrowings under the 2024 Credit Facility (as defined below), together with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the 
6.375
% Senior Notes (as defined below), to repay all borrowings under its existing 2021 Credit Facility.
F-22
Table of Contents
2024 Credit Facility
On October 24, 2024, the Company entered into the 2024 Credit Agreement, under which the Company's credit facility was increased to $
1.0
 billion from $
925.0
 million and the maturity date was extended to October 24, 2029 from August 11, 2027. The credit facility under the 2024 Credit Agreement (the "2024 Credit Facility") is comprised of an $
875.0
 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolver due 2029") and a $
125.0
 million term loan (the "Term Loan due 2029"). Pursuant to the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement, the interest rate for borrowings under the Revolver due 2029 and the Term Loan due 2029 is either the Prime Rate or SOFR plus a margin, which ranges from 
0.00
% to 
0.75
% for Prime Rate loans and from 
1.00
% to 
1.75
% for SOFR loans depending on the Company’s consolidated total leverage ratio. The interest rate for incremental borrowings as of December 31, 2024 was SOFR plus 
1.75
% (or 
6.11
%) for the SOFR-based option. The Company is required to pay fees on committed but unused portions of the Revolver due 2029, which range from 
0.15
% to 
0.225
%. The fee payable on committed but unused portions of the Revolver due 2029 was 
0.225
% as of December 31, 2024. The Term Loan due 2029 requires quarterly installments of $
1,562,500
 the last business day of each March, June, September and December, commencing December 31, 2024.
Borrowings under the 2024 Credit Facility are secured by substantially all personal property assets of the Company and any domestic subsidiary guarantors. 
Under the terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement, the covenant requiring the Company to have a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 
1.5
 to 1.0 was replaced with a covenant requiring the Company to have a consolidated interest coverage ratio (the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense, as defined in the 2024 Credit Agreement) of not less than 
3.0
 to 1.0 tested on a quarterly basis. In addition, the 2024 Credit Agreement continues to have a covenant requiring the Company to have a maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio of 
2.75
 to 1.00 (increasing to 
3.25
 to 1.00 in certain circumstances).
The Company determined that the amended terms of the 2024 Credit Agreement were not substantially different from the terms of the Company’s 2021 Credit Agreement prior to the amendment. Accordingly, debt modification accounting treatment was applied and the related impacts were immaterial. The amount of deferred financing costs write-off as a result of the amendment of the 2021 Credit Facility was immaterial in the Company's consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2024.
6.375
% Senior Notes due 2032
On October 22, 2024, the Company issued $
500.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
6.375
% Senior Notes due 2032 (the “
6.375
% Senior Notes”) in a transaction pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The proceeds from the issuance, together with borrowings under the 2024 Credit Facility, were utilized to redeem all of the Company's $
300.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
7.50
% Senior Notes due 2027 (the “
7.50
% Senior Notes”) on November 7, 2024, to repay all borrowings under the 2021 Credit Facility and to pay fees and expenses in connection with the foregoing. The 
6.375
% Senior Notes will mature on November 1, 2032. Interest on the 
6.375
% Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on May 1, 2025. The effective interest rate on the 
6.375
% Senior Notes, which includes debt issuance costs, is approximately 
6.60
%. In connection with the issuance of the 
6.375
% Senior Notes, the Company incurred and capitalized as a reduction of the principal amount of the 
6.375
% Senior Notes approximately $
6.9
 million in deferred financing costs which are being amortized using the effective interest rate over the term of the 
6.375
% Senior Notes. 
The 
6.375
% Senior Notes are senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company and are guaranteed by each of the Company’s subsidiaries that guarantee the obligations of the Company under the 2024 Credit Facility. If the Company experiences specific kinds of changes of control, the Company must offer to repurchase all of the 
6.375
% Senior Notes (unless otherwise redeemed) at a price equal to 
101
% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may redeem the 
6.375
% Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at any time (a) prior to November 1, 2027, at a price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount thereof, plus the applicable premium described in the associated indenture and accrued and unpaid interest and (b) on or after November 1, 2027 at specified redemption prices set forth in the indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, prior to November 1, 2027, the Company may redeem, in one or more transactions, up to an aggregate of 
40
% of the original principal amount of the 
6.375
% Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 
106.375
% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings.

1.75
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028
In December 2021, the Company issued $
258.75
 million aggregate principal amount of 
1.75
% Convertible Senior Notes due 2028 (the “
1.75
% Convertible Notes”). The total debt discount of $
56.1
 million at issuance consisted of two components: (i) the conversion option component, recorded to shareholders' equity, in the amount of $
48.8
 million, representing the difference between the principal amount of the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes upon issuance less the present value of the future cash flows of the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes using a borrowing rate for a similar non-convertible debt instrument and (ii) debt issuance costs of $
7.3
 million. The conversion option component of the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes was valued using Level 2 inputs under the fair value hierarchy. The unamortized portion of the total debt discount is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes. The effective interest rate on the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes, which includes the non-cash interest expense of debt discount amortization and debt issuance costs, was 
2.14
% as of December 31, 2024. 
The net proceeds from the issuance of the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes were approximately $
249.7
 million, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company, but before deducting the net cost of the 
1.75
% Convertible Note Hedge Transactions and the 
1.75
% Convertible Note Warrant Transactions (each as defined herein) described in Note 9 "Derivative Financial Instruments". The 
1.75
% Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and pay interest semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year at an annual rate of 
1.75
%. The 
1.75
% Convertible Notes will mature on December 1, 2028 unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms. Prior to June 1, 2028, the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes may be converted at the option of the holders only upon the occurrence of specified events and during certain periods, and thereafter until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The Company will satisfy any conversion by paying cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes to be converted and by paying or delivering, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at its election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes being converted. The initial conversion rate for the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes is 14.9831 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes (or 
3,876,867
 shares in the aggregate) and is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $
66.74
 per share. If an event of default on the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes occurs, the principal amount of the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any) may be declared immediately due and payable, subject to certain conditions. 
The 
1.75
% Convertible Notes are guaranteed by each of the Company’s subsidiaries that guarantee the obligations of the Company under the 2024 Credit Facility. 
1.75
% Convertible Notes holders may convert their Convertible Notes on or after June 28, 2028 at any time at their option. Holders may convert 
1.75
% Convertible Notes prior to June 28, 2028, only under the following circumstances: (i) during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock for at least 
20
 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 
30
 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 
130
% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day, (ii) during the 
five
 business day period after any 
five
 consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 
98
% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day and (iii) upon the occurrence of certain specified distributions or corporate events. 
As of December 31, 2024, the conditional conversion feature of the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes related to the price of our common stock equaling or exceeding 
130
% of the conversion price was triggered. As a result, the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes are convertible, in whole or in part, at the option of the holders from January 1, 2025 to March 31, 2025. Whether the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes will be convertible in subsequent periods will depend on the continued satisfaction of this condition or another conversion condition in the future. The 
1.75
% Convertible Notes were also convertible from October 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 based on satisfying this condition in the prior calendar quarter. No 
1.75
% Convertible Notes were converted during the period from October 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024. The Company has the intent and ability to utilize available borrowing capacity under the Revolver due 2029 to satisfy any cash conversion obligations that it may have, should holders choose to exercise their conversion rights during the period noted above. 
4.75
% Senior Notes due 2029
In April 2021, the Company issued $
350.0
 million aggregate principal amount of 
4.75
% Senior Notes due 2029 (the "
4.75
% Senior Notes"). The 
4.75
% Senior Notes will mature on May 1, 2029. Interest on the 
4.75
% Senior Notes started accruing April 20, 2021 and is payable semi-annually in cash in arrears May 1 and November 1 of each year, beginning on November 
F-24
Table of Contents
1, 2021. The effective interest rate on the 
4.75
% Senior Notes, which includes debt issuance costs, is approximately 
4.97
%. In connection with the issuance of the 
4.75
% Senior Notes, the Company incurred and capitalized as a reduction of the principal amount of the 
4.75
% Senior Notes approximately $
5.1
 million in deferred financing costs which are being amortized using the effective interest rate over the term of the 
4.75
% Senior Notes. 
The 
4.75
% Senior Notes are senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company and are guaranteed by each of the Company’s subsidiaries that guarantee the obligations of the Company under the 2024 Credit Facility. If the Company experiences specific kinds of changes of control, the Company must offer to repurchase all of the 
4.75
% Senior Notes (unless otherwise redeemed) at a price equal to 
101
% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may redeem the 
4.75

FAIR VALUE AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Company accounts for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair values are separated into three broad levels (Levels 1, 2 and 3) based on the assessment of the availability of observable market data and the significance of non-observable data used to determine fair value. Each fair value measurement must be assigned to a level corresponding to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels are as follows: 
•
Level 1 inputs, which are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. 
F-25
Table of Contents
•
Level 2 inputs, which are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
•
Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. These unobservable inputs reflect the entity’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (which might include the reporting entity’s own data).
The following table presents fair values of certain assets and liabilities as of for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
1.75
%

Convertible Note Hedge Transactions and Warrant Transactions
In December 2021, in connection with the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes offering, the Company entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions (together, the “
1.75
% Convertible Note Hedge Transactions”) with each of Bank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and Nomura Global Financial Products, Inc. (together, the “
1.75
% Convertible Note Hedge Counterparties”). Pursuant to the 
1.75
% Convertible Note Hedge Transactions, the Company acquired options to purchase the same number of shares of the Company's common stock (or 
3,876,867
 shares) initially underlying the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes at an initial strike price equal to the initial strike price of the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes of approximately $
66.74
 per share, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The options expire on December 1, 2028, subject to earlier exercise. 
At the same time, the Company also entered into separate, privately negotiated warrant transactions (the “
1.75
% Convertible Note Warrant Transactions”) with each of the 
1.75
% Convertible Note Hedge Counterparties, pursuant to which the Company sold warrants giving the counterparties the right to purchase the same number of shares of the Company's common stock (or 
3,876,867
 shares) underlying the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes, at an initial strike price of approximately $
85.30
 per share, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The warrants have a final expiration date of July 25, 2029.
The Company paid $
57.4
 million associated with the cost of the 
1.75
% Convertible Note Hedge Transactions and received proceeds of $
43.7
 million related to the 
1.75
% Convertible Note Warrant Transactions. Together, the 
1.75
% Convertible Note Hedge Transactions and the 
1.75
% Convertible Note Warrant Transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to the Company’s common stock upon any conversion of the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted 
1.75
% Convertible Notes compared to the potential dilution from the 
1.75
% Convertible Notes without such transactions. The 
1.75
% Convertible Note Warrant Transactions may have a dilutive effect on the Company's common stock to the extent that the market price per share 
F-26
Table of Contents
of the common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants. See Note 13 "Earnings Per Common Share" for additional information on the dilutive impact of the 
1.75
% Convertible Note Warrant Transactions.
As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the 
1.75
% Convertible Note Hedge Transactions and 
1.75
% Convertible Note Warrant Transactions are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives.

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS
In November 2024, the Company's Board of Directors ("the Board") authorized an increase in the amount of the Company's common stock that may be acquired over the next

LEASES
The Company has operating leases for certain facilities, trailers, forklifts and other assets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and expense related to these short-term leases was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Variable lease payments, principally related to trucks, forklifts, and index-related facility rent escalators, was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The leases have remaining lease terms of 
1

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits, audits, and other claims arising in the normal course of business. All such matters are subject to uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance. Accruals for these items, when 
F-30
Table of Contents
applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant.
Although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be ascertained, on the basis of present information, amounts already provided, availability of insurance coverage and legal advice received, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, results of operations, or cash flows.
In August 2019, a group of companies calling itself the Lusher Site Remediation Group (the “Group”) commenced litigation against the Company in Lusher Site Remediation Group v. Sturgis Iron & Metal Co., Inc., et al., Case Number 3:18-cv-00506, pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, relating to a site owned by the Company (the "Lusher Street Site"). The Group’s Second Amended Complaint, which was the first to assert claims against Patrick, asserted claims under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), 42 U.S.C. § 9601 et seq., an Indiana state environmental statute and Indiana common law. One defendant in the case, Sturgis Iron & Metal Co., Inc. (“Sturgis”), subsequently filed two cross claims against Patrick, asserting against the Company a claim for (i) contribution under CERCLA and (ii) contractual indemnity. The Company moved to dismiss the Group’s claims and also moved to dismiss Sturgis’s cross claims. On August 21, 2020, the court granted Patrick’s two motions to dismiss. The Group subsequently moved for reconsideration of the court’s decision. On July 3, 2023, the Court granted the Company’s Joint Motion to Dismiss without prejudice, dismissing all remaining claims against the Company for non-consent decree costs and entered an order on June 3, 2024, denying the plaintiff’s motion to bar contribution claims, thereby ending the case against the Company.
On March 19, 2021, the Company received a General Notice of Potential Liability from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), pursuant to Section 107(a) of CERCLA (the “Notice”). The Notice provides that the EPA has incurred and will likely incur additional costs relative to conducting a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ("RI/FS"), conducting Remedial Design/Remedial Action ("RD/RA"), and other investigation, planning, response, oversight, and enforcement activities related to the Lusher Street Site (the "Superfund Site"). Because the Company was the owner of and former operator within the Lusher Street Site and as such may be a potentially responsible party pursuant to CERCLA, the Company received the Notice and an indication that it may have a responsibility to contribute to the costs of RI/FS, RD/RA or additional mitigation efforts incurred or to be incurred by the EPA.
The Company sold certain parcels of real property that the EPA contends are connected to the Superfund Site (the "Divested Properties") in January 2022 for a pretax gain on disposal of $
5.5
 million that is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's consolidated statement of income for year ended December 31, 2022. The purchaser agreed to indemnify, defend and hold the Company harmless for all liability and exposure, both private and to all EPA claims, concerning and relating to the Divested Properties. No further proceedings occurred in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. As to the real properties that were not among the Divested Properties but remain the subject of the litigation, the Company does not currently believe that the litigation or the Superfund Site matter are likely to have a material adverse impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, any litigation is inherently uncertain, the EPA has yet to select a final remedy for the Superfund Site, and any judgment or injunctive relief entered against us or any adverse settlement could materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.

COMPENSATION PLANS
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company has various stock option and stock-based incentive plans and various agreements whereby stock options, restricted stock awards, and SARS are made available to certain key employees, directors, and others based upon meeting various individual, divisional or company-wide performance criteria and time-based criteria. All such awards qualify and are accounted for as equity awards. Equity incentive plan awards, which are granted under the Company's 2009 Omnibus Incentive Plan, are intended to retain and reward key employees for outstanding performance and efforts as they relate to the Company’s short-term and long-term objectives and its strategic plan. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 
2.0
 million common shares remain available for stock-based compensation grants.
Stock-based compensation expense was $

SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company has 
two
 reportable segments, Manufacturing and Distribution, which are defined based on the way in which internally reported information is regularly reviewed and evaluated by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (the "CODM"), who is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, to allocate resources, evaluate financial results and make decisions. The Company does not measure profitability at the end market (RV, marine, powersports, MH and industrial) level.

Manufacturing
 – This segment includes the following products: laminated products that are utilized to produce furniture, shelving, walls, countertops and cabinet products; cabinet doors; fiberglass bath fixtures and tile systems; hardwood furniture; vinyl printing; RV and marine furniture; audio systems and accessories, including amplifiers, tower speakers, soundbars, and subwoofers; decorative vinyl and paper laminated panels; solid surface, granite, and quartz countertop fabrication; RV painting; fabricated aluminum products; fiberglass and plastic components; fiberglass bath fixtures and tile systems; softwoods lumber; custom cabinetry; polymer-based and other flooring; electrical systems components including instrument and dash panels; wrapped vinyl, paper and hardwood profile mouldings; interior passage doors; air handling products; slide-out trim and fascia; thermoformed shower surrounds; specialty bath and closet building products; fiberglass and plastic helm systems and components products; treated, untreated and laminated plywood; wiring and wire harnesses; adhesives and sealants; boat towers, tops, trailers and frames; marine hardware and accessories; protective covers for boats, RVs, aircraft, and military and industrial equipment; aluminum and plastic fuel tanks; CNC molds and composite parts; roofs/canopies; wiper systems; integrated door systems; windshield systems; slotwall panels and components; fender flares and rear panels; and other products. 
Distribution
 – The Company distributes pre-finished wall and ceiling panels; drywall and drywall finishing products; electronics and audio systems components; appliances; marine accessories and components; wiring, electrical and plumbing products; fiber reinforced polyester products; cement siding; raw and processed lumber; interior passage doors; roofing products; laminate and ceramic flooring; tile; shower doors; furniture; fireplaces and surrounds; interior and exterior lighting products; RV awnings, windows, fiberglass siding and roofing; marine windshields; and other miscellaneous products in addition to providing transportation and logistics services.
The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company's segments and allocates resources to them based on a variety of indicators including but not limited to net sales, gross profit and operating income. On at least a quarterly basis, the CODM considers actual to budget variances as well as actual to prior year actual performance for both profit measures when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources to each segment. The CODM also uses segment gross profit and segment operating income to assess the performance of each segment by comparing the results of each segment with one another.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1 "Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies". Segment net sales data includes inter-segment sales. The Company accounts for inter-segment sales similar to third party transactions, which reflect current market prices. Certain income from purchase incentive agreements is

not allocated to the segments and instead recorded at the corporate level. Assets are identified to the segments except for cash, prepaid expenses, land and buildings, and certain deferred assets, which are identified with corporate. Corporate charges rent to the segments for use of the land and buildings based upon estimated market rates.

The following tables summarize key financial information by segment:
