INFORMATION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain “forward-looking statements” with respect to financial condition, results of operations, business strategies, operating efficiencies or synergies, competitive position, industry growth and projections, growth opportunities for existing products, plans and objectives of management, markets for the common stock of Patrick Industries, Inc. (the “Company” or “Patrick”) and other matters. Statements in this Form 10-K as well as other statements contained in the annual report and statements contained in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and publicly disseminated press releases, and statements which may be made from time to time in the future by management of the Company in presentations, which are not historical facts, are management’s current expectations and beliefs regarding future and anticipated developments and their impact on Patrick, and inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
There are a number of factors, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, which could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Many, but not all, of these factors are identified in the “Risk Factors” section of this Form 10-K as set forth in Part I, Item 1A, and include, without limitation:
•
the impact of any economic downturns on our primary end markets;
•
a decline in discretionary consumer spending;
•
pricing pressures due to competition;
•
costs and availability of raw materials and commodities;
•
inflationary pressure on our direct and indirect costs, its impact to our customers, and its impact to the end consumer;
•
the imposition of restrictions and taxes and/or tariffs on imports of raw materials and components used in our products;
•
information technology performance and cyber-related risks;
•
the availability of commercial credit;
•
the availability of retail and wholesale financing for recreational vehicles, watercraft, and residential and manufactured homes;
•
the availability and costs of labor;
•
the ability to manage our inventory levels effectively, as well as inventory levels of retailers and manufacturers;
•
the financial condition of our customers;
•
retention and concentration of material customers;
•
the ability to generate cash flow or obtain financing to fund growth;
•
future growth rates in the Company's core businesses;
•
the seasonality and cyclicality in the industries to which our products are sold;
•
realization and impact of efficiency improvements and cost reductions;
•
the successful integration of acquisitions and other growth initiatives;
•
increases in interest rates and oil and gasoline prices;
•
increases/decreases in the value of financial assets, which may affect discretionary spending in industries to which our products are sold;
•
the ability to retain key management personnel;
•
adverse weather conditions impacting retail sales;
•
our ability to remain in compliance with our credit agreement covenants;
•
the impact of any pandemic or other public health emergency on the economy, our end markets and our operations, and;
•
national and regional economic, market and political conditions.
You should consider forward-looking statements, therefore, in light of various important factors, including those set forth in the reports and documents that the Company files with the SEC, including this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 
December 31, 2024
.  
These and other risks and uncertainties are discussed more fully at Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors.”
Any projections of financial performance or statements concerning expectations as to future developments should not be construed in any manner as a guarantee that such results or developments will, in fact, occur. There can be no assurance that any forward-looking statement will be realized or that actual results will not be materially different from that set forth in such forward-looking statement. The Company does not undertake to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, and specifically disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or to reflect any change in our expectations after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any statement is based, except as required by law.
