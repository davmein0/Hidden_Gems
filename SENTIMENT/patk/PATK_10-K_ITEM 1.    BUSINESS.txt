Company Overview
Patrick is a leading component solutions provider for the recreational vehicle ("RV"), marine, powersports, manufactured housing ("MH") and various industrial markets – including single and multi-family housing, hospitality, institutional and commercial markets. 
The Company operates through a nationwide network that includes, as of December 31, 2024, approximately 179 manufacturing plants and 47 warehouse and distribution facilities located in 25 states, with a small presence in Mexico, China and Canada. The Company operates within two reportable segments, Manufacturing and Distribution, through a nationwide network of manufacturing and distribution centers for its products, thereby reducing in-transit delivery time and cost to the regional manufacturing footprint of its customers. The Manufacturing and Distribution segments accounted for 74% and 26%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated net sales for the year ended December, 31, 2024. Financial information about these operating segments is included in Note 17 "Segment Information" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the "Form 10-K") and incorporated herein by reference.
The Company’s capital allocation strategy is to optimally manage and utilize its resources and leverage its platform of operating brands to continue to grow, reinvest in its business, and return capital to shareholders. Through strategic acquisitions, expansion both geographically and into new product lines and investment in infrastructure and capital expenditures, Patrick seeks to ensure that its operating network contains capacity, technology and innovative thought processes to support anticipated growth needs, effectively respond to changes in market conditions, inventory and sales levels, and successfully integrate manufacturing, distribution and administrative functions.
Over the last three years, we have executed on a number of new product initiatives and completed acquisitions for approximately $696 million in total consideration that directly complement our core competencies and existing products, expand our presence in our primary end markets, and position us to opportunistically enter into adjacent end markets or product categories. 
Patrick believes that returning capital to shareholders is an important part of its capital allocation strategy, and during 2024 we returned $55 million to shareholders through our regular quarterly dividend and opportunistic share repurchases.
The Company was incorporated in 1959 in Indiana. The Company's principal executive and administrative offices are located at 107 West Franklin Street, Elkhart, Indiana 46516 and the telephone number is (574) 294-7511; Internet website address:

Primary Markets
Patrick manufactures and distributes its products for five primary end markets. Our operating facilities generally are strategically located in proximity to the customers they serve. Previously, our sales to the powersports end market were included in the Company’s marine end market sales. Effective with the first quarter of 2024, powersports net sales are being reported separately after the January 2024 acquisition of Sportech, LLC (“Sportech”), as disclosed in Note 2 "Revenue Recognition" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recreational Vehicles
The Company’s RV products are sold primarily to major manufacturers of RVs, smaller original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), and to a lesser extent, manufacturers in adjacent industries. The principal types of recreational vehicles include (1) towables: conventional travel trailers, fifth wheels, folding camping trailers, and truck campers; and (2) motorized: class A (large motor homes), class B (van campers), and class C (small-to-mid size motor homes). The RV market is primarily dominated by Thor Industries, Inc. (“Thor”), Forest River, Inc. (“Forest River”) and Winnebago Industries, Inc. ("Winnebago") which combined held approximately 86% of retail market share for towables and 83% for motorized units for 
2024
 as reported per Statistical Surveys, Inc. ("SSI"). 
We believe there has been substantial growth over the past several years in the consumer’s affinity for the Outdoor Enthusiast lifestyle. As more people see the benefits of enjoying the outdoors with families and friends, there should be a positive impact on long-term demand in the RV market. We also are optimistic about the near-term outlook for the RV market, which we believe bottomed in 2023 after a period of sharp declines in OEM production. Following a dealer inventory restocking in the first half of 2024, OEMs reduced production slightly in the second half of 2024 as retail demand decreased, with dealers managing inventory levels and the OEMs demonstrating operating discipline to maintain a balanced inventory channel for the long-term health and stability of the industry. Our analysis suggests that dealer inventory levels are currently well below historical norms and will need to be replenished when retail demand recovers. Our strategy in the RV space continues to be centered around our goal of providing best-in-class customer service and a growing portfolio of products to OEMs through our full solutions model, therefore helping our customers innovate and build quality units across the spectrum of feature and price.
We estimate that our mix of RV revenues related to towable units and motorized units is consistent with the overall RV industry production mix. In 2024, according to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association ("RVIA"), towable and motorized unit shipments represented approximately 90% and 10%, respectively, of total RV industry wholesale shipments with wholesale unit shipments increasing 12% in the towable sector and decreasing 24% in the motorized sector in 2024 compared to the prior year.
Recreational vehicle purchases are generally consumer discretionary income purchases, and therefore, any situation which causes concerns related to discretionary income may have a negative impact on the RV market. The Company believes that industry-wide retail sales and the related production levels of RVs will continue to be dependent on the overall strength of the economy, consumer confidence levels, equity securities market trends, fluctuations in dealer inventories, the level of disposable income, and other demographic trends. 
Demographic and ownership trends continue to point to favorable market growth for the long term in the RV market, as we believe that the shift toward outdoor, nature-based tourism activities has continued, despite the loss of many first time campers who had contributed to a significant increase in camping participation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on data from the 2024 Kampgrounds of America, Inc. ("KOA") North American Camping and Outdoor Hospitality Report, utilizing surveys of North American leisure travelers, camping remains popular, with annual camping households of 54 million in 2023 which, while a decrease from 58 million in 2022, is well above pre-pandemic levels of 39 million in 2018 and 42 million in 2019. Younger campers (Millennials and GenZers) still represent an important camper demographic group despite a decrease in participation rates since the peak of the pandemic, with 48% of annual campers and 49% of new campers from these groups. Additionally, according to the 2024 KOA report, 25% of 2023 camper households reported 
6
Table of Contents
household income of over $100,000. While this percentage was down from 28% in 2022, these higher-income households still represented a significantly greater proportion of campers than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Following a similar pattern as overall camping participation, 13.2 million households reported taking at least one RV trip in 2023, which was lower than in 2022 but well above pre-pandemic levels of 9.4 million in 2018 and 11.3 million in 2019.
Detailed narrative information about the Company’s sales to the RV industry is included in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (the "MD&A") of this Form 10-K.
Marine 
We believe that the marine market reflects the active, outdoor enthusiast-based, family-oriented lifestyle, similar to our RV and powersports end markets, and the Company has increased its focus and expanded its presence in this market through recent acquisitions. Consumer demand in the marine market is generally driven by the popularity of the recreational and leisure lifestyle and by economic conditions. The powerboat sector, which is our primary marine market, has experienced a down cycle since mid-2023, resulting in continued softness particularly in our higher-engineered ski/wake and pontoon categories, where we maintain a significant market presence. After a slight decrease in 2023, OEM production declined further in 2024 as concerns relating to elevated interest rates, inflation and overall economic uncertainties dampened retail demand and led marine dealers to reduce inventory levels. The Company's marine revenue mix is slightly more concentrated toward higher dollar units, particularly the pontoon and ski and wake segments, which have seen more pronounced softness in market demand beginning in the second half of 2023 and throughout 2024 compared to the broader marine market. We expect to continue to feel the effects of our revenue mix through the first half of 2025. Despite short-term challenges, we remain optimistic about the long-term outlook including within the high value, premium segment of the marine industry that we serve.
According to the National Marine Manufacturers Association (“NMMA”), per its 2023 U.S. Recreational Boating Statistical Abstract (the "Abstract"), total U.S. retail expenditures on boats, engines, accessories, and related costs fell 2.6% to $57.7 billion in 2023 compared to 2022. Based on data from the Abstract, we estimate that the average age of pre-owned powerboats sold during 2023 was approximately 23 years compared to an average useful life of 30 years. 
The Company’s sales to the marine industry are primarily focused on the powerboat sector of the market which is comprised of four main categories: fiberglass, aluminum fishing, pontoon and ski & wake. Based on current available data per SSI through December 2024, within the powerboat sector for 2024, fiberglass units a
ccounted for approximately 34% of retail unit sales, aluminum 29%, pontoon 32% and ski & wake 5%. In addition, per SSI, 
marine powerboat retail unit shipments decreased 
approximately 8% in 2024
 compared to 2023, while marine wholesale unit shipments, according to Company estimates based on NMMA data, decreased approximatel
y 25%
 in 
2024
 compared to 2023.
Detailed narrative information about the Company’s sales to the marine industry is included in the MD&A of this Form 10-K.
Powersports 
Through acquisitions completed in recent years, the Company entered the powersports end market. Powersports is a category of motorsports which includes vehicles such as motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles ("ATVs"), side-by-sides, snowmobiles, scooters, golf carts and other personal transportation vehicles, and other related categories. Previously, our sales to the powersports end market were included in the Company’s marine end market sales. Effective with the first quarter of 2024, powersports net sales are being reported separately after the January 2024 acquisition of Sportech, as disclosed in Note 2 "Revenue Recognition" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our powersports business is primarily focused on the utility and premium segments of the side-by-side market, which have been outperforming the more discretionary recreational segment. We also participate in the motorcycle and golf cart segments of the market. OEMs and dealers are actively managing field inventory levels to align with retail demand and in an effort to update units held in dealer inventories. We believe that our portfolio of brands and products is well-positioned to benefit from future market growth. As OEMs and dealers continue to manage their businesses to better align with current retail demand, we are focused on supporting OEMs by developing new products and solutions that deliver value to consumers.
Detailed narrative information about the Company’s sales to the powersports industry is included in the MD&A of this Form 10-K.

Manufactured Housing
The Company’s products for this market are sold primarily to major manufacturers of manufactured homes, other OEMs, and to a lesser extent, manufacturers in adjacent industries. In the aggregate, the top three manufacturers, Clayton Homes, Inc., Skyline Champion Corporation and Cavco Industries, Inc., combined to produce approximately 84%

of MH market retail unit shipments in 2024 per SSI.
Wholesale unit shipments have increased in the MH industry to approximately 
103,300 
units in 2024 compared to approximately 
89,200
 units in 
2023
. The Company believes there is growth potential for this market in the long term driven by pent-up demand, multi-family housing capacity, demand for lower-cost rental options, increased affordability and quality, demographic trends such as increased first-time home buyers and urban-to-suburban relocations trends, new home pricing, and investments from developers and real estate investment trusts. We continue to expand our product offerings to meet the evolving needs of our OEM customers, including energy efficient water heaters, furnaces, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning ("HVAC") duct systems and other products for OEMs seeking to exceed government sustainability guidelines on manufactured homes. 
Factors that may favorably impact demand further in this industry include jobs growth, consumer confidence, favorable changes in financing regulations, a narrowing in the difference between interest rates on MH loans and mortgages on traditional residential "stick-built" housing, and any improvement in conditions in the asset-backed securities markets for manufactured housing loans.
We believe that MH units offer a cost-effective housing solution in a time when high home prices coupled with elevated mortgage interest rates have negatively impacted housing affordability. 
Detailed narrative information about the Company’s sales to the MH industry is included in the MD&A of this Form 10-K.
Industrial Markets
We estimate that approximately 75% to 85% of our industrial net sales in 2024 were associated with the U.S. residential housing market. We believe that there is a direct correlation between the demand for our products and new residential housing construction and existing home remodeling activities. Patrick's sales to the industrial market generally lag new housing starts by four to six months as our industrial products are generally among the last components installed into new unit construction and will vary based on differences in regional economic prospects. 
Many of Patrick's core manufacturing products are also utilized in the kitchen cabinet, high-rise, office and household furniture, hospitality, and fixtures and commercial furnishings markets. These markets are generally categorized by a more performance-than-price driven customer base and provide an opportunity for the Company to diversify its customer base. Additionally, we believe that other residential and commercial segments have been less vulnerable to import competition, and therefore, provide opportunities for increased sales penetration and market share gains. In 2024, new housing starts were down from 2023 by approximately 4%, with single family housing starts increasing approximately 6% and multifamily housing starts decreasing 25%. Despite some interest rate relief in 2024, housing affordability continued to be an issue as housing prices and mortgage rates remained elevated compared to prior years. Low inventory and high prices for existing homes for sale may provide support for our industrial market in 2025.
Detailed narrative information about the Company’s sales to the industrial markets is included in the MD&A of this Form 10-K.
Strategic Acquisitions
The Company is focused on driving growth in its primary markets through the acquisition of companies with strong management teams having a strategic fit with Patrick’s core values, business model and customer presence, as well as additional product lines, facilities, or other assets to complement or expand its existing businesses. The Company may explore strategic acquisition opportunities that are not directly linked to the five primary markets it serves in order to further leverage its core competencies in manufacturing and distribution, diversify its end market exposure and presence, and expand its footprint outside of its core Midwest markets.
During 
2024
, the Company completed acquisitions for approximately $418 million of total consideration and over the last three years has completed acquisitions for approximately $696 million of total consideration. See Note 3 "Acquisitions" of

the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K for further discussion of acquisitions completed by the Company in 2024, 2023 and 2022. 
Competition
The RV, marine, powersports, MH and industrial markets are highly competitive, both among manufacturers and the suppliers of various components. The barriers to entry for each industry are generally low and include compliance with industry standards, codes and safety requirements, and the initial capital investment required to establish manufacturing operations. In addition, the Company competes with manufacturers of manufactured homes with vertically integrated operations. Across the Company’s range of products and services, competition exists primarily on price, product features and innovation, timely and reliable delivery, quality and customer service. Several competitors compete with Patrick in each product line on a regional and local basis. However, in order for a competitor to compete with Patrick on a national basis, the Company believes that a substantial capital commitment and investment in personnel and facilities would be required. 
Capacity and Plant Expansions
Patrick has the ability to fulfill demand for certain products in excess of capacity at certain facilities by shifting production to other facilities. Purchases of property, plant, and equipment for 2024 consisted of $76 million of investments which were primarily used to provide more advanced manufacturing automation and replace and upgrade production equipment. Management regularly monitors capacity at its facilities and reallocates existing resources where needed to maintain production efficiencies throughout all of its operations and capitalize on commercial and industrial synergies in key regions to support profitable growth, grow its customer base, and expand its geographical product reach outside its core Midwest market. 
Branding
New product development is a key component of the Company’s efforts to grow its market share and revenue base, adapt to changing market conditions, and proactively address customer demand. The Company has expanded its product and service offerings with the integration of new and innovative product lines into its operations that bring additional value to customers and create additional scale advantages. 
The Studio
The Company's Design/Innovation Center and Showroom, The Studio, is located in Elkhart, Indiana. The Studio presents the latest design trends and products in the markets served by Patrick and provides a creative environment for customers to design products and enhance their brand. The 45,000 square foot facility includes a 25,000 square foot showroom devoted to the display of products, capabilities and services offered by each of Patrick’s business units, in addition to offices and conference rooms. The Company’s specialized team of designers, engineers and graphic artists works with RV, marine, powersports, MH and industrial customers to meet their creative design and product needs, including creating new styles and utilizing new colors, patterns, products, and materials for panels and mouldings, cabinet doors, furniture, lighting and other products. Other services provided at The Studio include product development, 3D CAD illustration, 3D printing, photography and marketing. 
Marine Studio
The Company's Marine Studio, located in Sarasota, Florida, is a comprehensive marine studio showroom, design and engineering center, which provides engineering and integrated design solutions for our marine customers. The 14,000 square foot facility includes a showroom that displays the Company's marine products as well as the marine design and engineering capabilities and services offered by our marine businesses.
Operating Brands
Through its operating brands, the Company provides customers with specific product knowledge, expertise and support that are tailored to their needs. The Company strives to be the supplier of choice for its customers by elevating the customer purchasing experience with expert product line managers, and support staff and strategic partnerships for each operating brand, which help drive efficiency and maximize value for its customers.

Table of Contents
The Company’s research and development efforts are intended to maintain leadership positions in core products and provide the Company with a competitive edge as it seeks additional business with new and existing customers. The Company also works with technology development partners, including customers, to develop technological capabilities and new products and applications.
Marketing and Distribution
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately 4,500 active customers. Its revenues from the RV market include sales to two major manufacturers of RVs that each account for over 10% of the Company's net sales, Forest River and Thor. Both Forest River and Thor have multiple businesses and brands that operate independently under the parent company and these multiple businesses and brands generally purchase our products independently from one another. The Company’s sales to the various businesses of Forest River and Thor, on a combined basis, accounted for 29%, 29% and 38% of our consolidated net sales, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 
2022
, respectively.
The Company generally maintains supplies of various commodity products in its warehouses to ensure that it has product on hand for its distribution customers. The Company purchases a majority of its distribution segment products in railcar, container, or truckload quantities
, which are warehoused prior to their sale t
o customers. 
Approximat
ely 9% 
of the Company's distribution segment’s sales were from products shipped directly from the suppliers to Patrick customers in each of 2024, 2023 and 2022. Typically, there is a two to four-week period 
between Patrick receiving a purchase order and the delivery of products to its warehouses or customers and, as a result, the Company has no material backlog of orders. However, this timing can fluctuate depending on overall market factors and end market we serve. In periods of declining market conditions, customer order rates can decline, resulting in less efficient logistics planning and fulfillment and thus increasing delivery costs due to increased numbers of shipments with fewer products in each shipment. 
Raw Materials
Patrick has arrangements with certain suppliers that provide for exclusivity in certain geographic areas, pricing structures and rebate agreements among other terms. 
Raw materials are primarily commodity products, such as lauan, gypsum
,
 particleboard and other softwood and hardwood lumber products, aluminum, copper, plastic resin, fiberglass and overlays, among others which are available from many suppliers. Our customers do not maintain long-term supply contracts, and therefore, the Company bears the risk of accurate forecasting of customer orders. Our sales in the short-term could be negatively impacted in the event any unforeseen negative circumstances were to affect our major suppliers. In addition, demand changes in certain market sectors can result in fluctuating costs of certain more commodity-oriented raw materials and other products that are utilized and distributed. 
We believe that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s inventory levels are appropriately balanced with expected OEM production, and we will continue to manage inventory based on anticipated customer needs. Additionally, the Company continually explores alternative sources of raw materials and components, both domestically and from outside the U.S.

Alternate sources of supply are available for all of its material purchases.
Regulation and Environmental Quality
The Company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations administered by federal, state, and local regulatory authorities including requirements relating to air, water, land and noise pollution. Additionally, these requirements regulate the Company's use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used or generated during specific manufacturing processes.
Select products are subject to various legally binding or voluntary standards. For example, the composite wood substrate materials that Patrick utilizes in the production process in the RV marketplace have been certified as to compliance with applicable emission standards developed by the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”). All suppliers and manufacturers of composite wood materials are required to comply with the current CARB regulations.
The Company is certified to sell Forestry Stewardship Council (“FSC”) materials to its customers at certain of its manufacturing branches. The FSC certification provides a link between responsible production and consumption of materials from the world’s forests and assists the Company’s customers in making socially and environmentally responsible buying decisions on the products they purchase. Upholstered products and mattresses provided by the Company for RVs must 
10
Table of Contents
comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards regulated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regarding flammability.
Select raw materials are subject to tariffs and other import duties, although we have historically received benefits from duty-free imports on certain products from certain countries pursuant to the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences ("GSP") program. The current U.S. administration’s trade policies may result in additional tariffs being imposed on certain products we import. Additionally, we are subject to government regulations relating to importation activities, including related to U.S. Customs and Border Protection ("CBP") withhold release orders.
The Company also produces and provides products for manufactured homes that must comply with performance and construction regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
For additional information on the Company's efforts for sustainability and environmental quality, please see our 2024 Responsibility & Sustainability Report under "ESG" on the "For Investors" section of our website. Information on our website is not incorporated in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Seasonality
Manufacturing operations in the RV, marine, powersports and MH industries historically have been seasonal and at their highest levels when the weather is moderate. Accordingly, the Company’s sales and profits had generally been the highest in the second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. Seasonal industry trends in the past several years have included the impact related to the addition of major RV manufacturer open houses for dealers in the August-September timeframe and marine open houses in the December-February timeframe, resulting in dealers delaying certain restocking purchases until new product lines are introduced at these shows. In addition, recent seasonal industry trends have been, and future trends may be, different than in prior years due to volatile economic conditions, interest rates, access to financing, cost of fuel, national and regional economic conditions and consumer confidence on retail sales of RVs, powersports and marine units and other products for which the Company sells its components, as well as fluctuations in RV, powersports and marine dealer inventories, increased volatility in demand from RV, powersports and marine dealers, the timing of dealer orders, and from time to time, the impact of severe weather conditions on the timing of industry-wide wholesale shipments.
Human Capital Management
Our people are the heart of our business, and we allocate substantial resources to foster the well-being, success and growth of our team members in an inclusive and diverse environment which we believe is fundamental to our values and our service to our customers. As of December 31, 2024, our team members totaled approximately 10,000, of which 80% are hourly team members who serve our customers by producing and distributing products in our RV, powersports, marine, MH and industrial end markets, and 20% who are salaried employees who manage the resources, capital allocations, business decisions, and customer relationships of our end markets.
The majority of our team members work in our facilities to produce or distribute products for our customers. Our investment in human capital resources focuses on this environment to ensure their well-being and success. Our primary commitment to our team members in the production environment is to their safety, well-being and progress, and in this regard our human capital management programs focus on the following, in addition to our health care insurance and other employment benefits:
•
Free assistance programs available to all team members and their families to address mental health and other matters which arise, which we believe are essential during periods of uncertainty; 
•
Tuition reimbursement programs available to all team members as they pursue educational opportunities;
•
Leadership programs available to all employees that are designed to foster leadership and communication skills to advance team members to the next stage of their careers;
•
Job safety analysis, which identifies risks unique to each production environment, training and empowering our team members to mitigate risks and develop workplace best practices;
•
Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") preparedness, which involves site specific training development to educate and enable our team members to work safely and effectively;
•
Industrial hygiene audits and testing, ensuring that our team members work in healthy environments with respect to air quality and noise reduction;

Our success is dependent on our ability to hire, retain, and engage highly qualified team members who serve our customers. In this regard, we aspire to be a merit-based organization that is inclusive and diverse, building a culture where our team members feel they belong. Our leadership development programs bring a diverse and energetic source of talent to lead the future of our organization, and our recruitment efforts strive to foster an inclusive culture that we believe strengthens our organization and our ability to serve our customers.
