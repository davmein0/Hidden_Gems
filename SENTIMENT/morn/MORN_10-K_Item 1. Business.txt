Item 1. Business - “Government Regulation” and in Part I, Item 1A - “Risk Factors” of this Report. The increased complexity and extent of regulation globally is a challenge for both Morningstar and its clients, and we continue to invest in our compliance organization, processes and controls. Additionally, current regulatory uncertainty in the US — including changes and the pace of changes enacted by the current presidential administration and related leadership changes at US government agencies such as the US Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as recent and potential future US Supreme Court rulings — may impact our business. 
EU and UK Regulatory Divergence
For our regulated businesses in the UK and EU, following the UK’s Financial Services and Markets Act 2023, there is a growing risk of divergence as between the specifics of the EU and UK regulatory regimes, as the UK continues to adapt its post-Brexit financial services regulatory framework and to tailor its rules to suit the UK market, while seeking to strengthen its position in wholesale markets more generally.
With respect to our credit ratings and indexes business, divergence risks further increase the costs and complexity of regulatory compliance.
In relation to investment management, any divergence risk remains to be seen pending the next iteration of the UK Financial Conduct Authority's three-year strategy.
Increased ESG Regulation and Anti-ESG Scrutiny
Interest from investors, regulators and other relevant stakeholders in firms adopting ESG-related business and operational risk strategies persists. Morningstar is impacted by these trends on a corporate level, as a US public company with international operations, and on a business level. Specifically, we anticipate that this area will experience further regulatory developments likely to have long term impacts on our delivery of products and services, customer interactions, physical operations, technology systems, and dependencies on third parties.
Morningstar is monitoring proposed ESG legislation in the US, EU, and in other jurisdictions relevant to its business activities. The future of any US regulation of sustainability matters is uncertain and  may not align with current or future regulations in other jurisdictions, including the EU. These and other potential regulations may impact not only the scope of our disclosure obligations and the products and services we provide to customers but also present an opportunity to guide and inform investors who are looking to understand the regulations and develop their own workflows to ensure their compliance with new requirements.
The politicization of ESG-related business activities and investments has increased in recent years, particularly in the US. This politicization may result in Morningstar facing heightened scrutiny in this regard, and may result in the company incurring increased costs in addressing related inquiries. Morningstar continues to closely monitor the ESG and anti-ESG landscape.
Cybersecurity, Data Privacy and Artificial Intelligence 
Data privacy regulation continues to proliferate, as numerous national and state jurisdictions have adopted or are considering new data privacy regulations. As a related matter, issues of cybersecurity as they relate to the identification and mitigation of cyber threats also continue to grow in prominence and laws governing data breaches continue to proliferate globally. Financial regulators have also increased their scrutiny of the data protection practices of the entities, such as Morningstar, that they oversee.

The introduction of the EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act corresponds with a growing concern among financial services regulators as to the increasing influence of information technology service providers, and the risks to financial stability posed by dependency on those firms. Ensuring resiliency necessarily captures group (rather than individual entity) arrangements and is therefore both costly and complex. Morningstar is monitoring related developments in other countries that may follow the EU’s lead.
Regulators in various global jurisdictions have adopted or are considering regulations governing AI technologies, such as the EU AI Act. Additionally, regulators have sought to clarify that existing regulations apply to novel use cases involving AI technologies. Combined, this regulatory activity creates a complex and potentially costly compliance environment as Morningstar deploys AI technologies in its products and in tools used in the workplace. 
Other Regulatory Trends
Finally, our company is impacted by government regulation and policies focused on macroeconomic trends such as inflation, trade, and unemployment. Central banks’ increases in interest rates to combat inflationary pressures increases our interest expense on our variable rate indebtedness, while the volatile rate environment can impact credit issuance volumes, impacting our credit rating business, as well as M&A activity more broadly. Our compensation expense reflects rising wage scales in many of the markets where we operate as unemployment rates remain low. Overall, our business, balance sheet, technological infrastructure, and teams have shown resilience and flexibility navigating global macroeconomic trends.

In 2024, our consolidated revenue rose $236.5 million, or 11.6%. Foreign currency movements increased revenue by $1.3 million in 2024. 
License-based revenue, which represents subscription services available to customers, increased 7.1%, or 7.6% on an organic basis, during 2024. 
Reported and organic revenue grow
th was primarily driven by strong demand for PitchBook and Morningstar Data and Analytics products.
Asset-based revenue increased 19.2%, on both a reported and organic basis, during 2024. Reported and organic revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in Morningstar Wealth, Morningstar Indexes, and Morningstar Retirement.
Transaction-based revenue increased 31.2%, or 28.8% on an organic basis, during 2024. Reported and organic revenue was primarily driven by Morningstar Credit.
Organic revenue
Organic revenue is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. 
We exclude revenue from acquired businesses from our organic revenue growth calculation for a period of 12 months after we complete the acquisi
tion. For divestitures, we exclude revenue in the prior period for which there is no comparable revenue in the current period. 
We will exclude revenue related to our Commodity and Energy Data business, which we divested in the third quarter of 2024
, as well as revenue and interim service fees associated with the sale of customer assets from the US Morningstar Wealth Turnkey Asset Management Platform (TAMP) to AssetMark (sale of US TAMP assets), which we divested in the f
ourth quarter of 2024, from our organic revenue growth calculation for a period of 12 months after we complete the divestitures.
Excluding revenue from acquisitions, divestitures, accounting changes, and the impact of foreign currency translations, organic revenue increased 11.8% in 2024. Morningstar Credit, PitchBook, and Morningstar Data and Analytics were the largest drivers of the increase in organic revenue during 2024.

Revenue Renewal Rates 
As discussed in 
How We Evaluate Our Business
, we calculate revenue renewal rates to help measure how successful we've been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue. The figures for license-based products includes the effect of price changes; increasing client bases upon contract renewal; any loss of clients due to cancellations; and changes to the contract value upon renewal (such as increased users). These factors, therefore, can result in renewal rate percentages greater or lower than 100%.
60
Table of Contents

Our revenue renewal rate calculation includes only those products that we consider to be license-based. These are primarily weighted toward Morningstar Data and Analytics and PitchBook products, but also includes other license-based products and services. For these license-based products and services, we estimate that our annual renewal rate was approximat
ely
 100% in
 2024 versus 103% in 
2023.

Cost of revenue
Cost of revenue is our largest category of operating expense, representing about one-half of our total operating expense. Our business relies heavily on human capital, and cost of revenue includes the compensation expense for employees who produce our products and services. We include compensation expense for approximately 76% of our employees in this category.
61
Table of Contents

Cost of revenue increased $52.2 million, or 6.2%, in 2024. Higher compensation expense of $35.8 million was the largest contributor to the increase, primarily driven by higher bonus expense due to favorable performance compared to plan targets. The company updated its definition of compensation expense to incorporate commissions, severance, and stock-based compensation, in addition to salaries, bonus, employee benefits, and payroll taxes, which were all included in the earlier definition. Compensation expense for prior periods has been retroactively adjusted for the updated definition. Technology infrastructure costs consisting of expenses related to SaaS-based software subscriptions and cloud computing of $14.0 million were also a driver in higher operating expense during 2024 due to the company's investment in and renewal of various SaaS-based platforms across the business.
Sales and marketing
Sales and marketing expense increased $17.2 million, or 4.1%, in 2024. Higher compensation expense of $5.5 million was the largest contributor, primarily due to the factors noted above relating to cost of revenue. Advertising and marketing costs increased $5.4 million during 2024 due to higher advertising and marketing campaign expense.
General and administrative
General and administrative expense decreased $28.6 million, or 8.0%, in 2024. A decline in professional fees and the 2023 DBRS, Inc. SEC-related settlement expenses of $15.8 million and $8.0 million, respectively, were the largest contributors to the decline in general and administrative expense. Professional fees decreased due to lower expenses for third-party resources supporting M&A activity and the transition of the company's China-based activities as well as a decrease in the use of outside professional services. In addition, professional fees in 2023 reflected the impact of higher legal fees primarily associated the SEC-related settlement.
On September 29, 2023, DBRS, Inc. entered into two settlements with the SEC requiring DBRS, Inc. to pay an aggregate of $8.0 million in civil monetary penalties. The DBRS, Inc. SEC settlements resulted in a $6.0 million civil monetary penalty to the SEC to resolve the investigation related to record-keeping, and a $2.0 million civil monetary penalty to the SEC to resolve the investigation related to commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) ratings methodologies, both in early October 2023. 
Facilities-related expenses also declined $6.4 million during 2024 partially due to reduction of office space in certain geographies. These decreases were partially offset by higher compensation expense primarily due to an increase in company-sponsored benefits and bonus expense.
Depreciation and amortization
In 2024, depreciation and amortization increased $5.5 million, or 3.0%, primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense which was partially offset by a decrease in intangible amortization expense.
Depreciation expense increased $12.2 million in 2024, due primarily to higher capitalized software costs for product enhancements in prior periods, as well as the impact of accelerated depreciation related to the sale of US TAMP assets.
Intangible amortization expense decreased 
$6.0 million
 in 
2024
, as certain intangible assets from some of our earlier acquisitions became fully amortized.
Gain on sale of customer assets
In 2024, we recorded a $64.0 million gain on 
sale of US TAMP assets

Transformation costs include professional fees and the temporary duplication of headcount. As the company hired replacement roles in other markets and shifted capabilities, it employed certain Shenzhen-based staff through the transition period, which resulted in elevated compensation costs on a temporary basis. 
Asset impairment costs include the write-off or accelerated depreciation of fixed assets in the Shenzhen, China office that were not redeployed, in addition to lease abandonment costs as the company downsized its office space prior to the lease termination date.

Morningstar Data and Analytics total revenue increased $40.9 million, or 5.5%, in 2024. Revenue grew 5.8% on an organic basis, driven primarily by increases in Morningstar Direct and Morningstar Data. Organic revenue growth excludes revenue associated with the Commodity and Energy Data business beginning in the fourth quarter and foreign currency impact.
Morningstar Direct contributed $22.1 million to Morningstar Data and Analytics revenue growth, with revenue increasing 10.9%, or 10.8%, on an organic basis, reflecting growth across all major geographies. Morningstar Direct licenses increased 1.1%.
Morningstar Data contributed $19.4 million to Morningstar Data and Analytics revenue growth, with revenue increasing 6.9%, or 6.6% on an organic basis. Increases in managed investment (fund) data and Morningstar Essentials helped drive Morningstar Data growth, partially offset by softness in exchange market data.
Morningstar Data and Analytics adjusted operating income increased $15.6 million, or 4.6%, and adjusted operating margin decreased 0.4 percentage points in 2024. Increased revenue was partially offset by higher compensation costs, reflecting growth in bonuses, merit increases, and higher headcount; increased spending on sales and marketing; and the impact of the sale of the company's Commodity and Energy Data business. 
Morningstar Data and Analytics depreciation expense was $37.9 million and $31.0 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively.

PitchBook total revenue increased $66.5 million, or 12.0%, in 2024. Revenue grew 12.1% on an organic basis.
Revenue for the PitchBook platform, direct data, and Leveraged Commentary & Data (LCD) combined contributed $66.7 million to PitchBook revenue growth, with revenue increasing 12.3%, or 12.4% on an organic basis. Growth was primarily driven by the PitchBook platform with licensed users growing 16.4%, reflecting both new client users and expansion with existing clients, as well as variability driven by user maintenance activities and updates to user lists when enterprise clients renew. PitchBook clients who were not previously LCD clients drove the majority of the increase in licensed users, although growth continued to reflect the impact of legacy LCD clients who have moved to the PitchBook platform and are now reflected in licensed user counts. PitchBook platform growth drivers reflected strength in PitchBook's core investor and advisor client segments, including venture capital, private equity, and investment banks. This was partially offset by continued softness in the corporate client segment, especially with smaller firms with more limited use cases.
PitchBook adjusted operating income
 increased 
$38.3 million
, or 
25.9%, and adjusted operating margin increased 3.3 percentage points in 2024. The increase in margin was partially driven by the forfeiture of stock in the now-terminated PitchBook management bonus plan, which was a compensation vehicle designed primarily to incentivize PitchBook's former CEO.
PitchBook depreciation expense was $31.8 million and $26.8 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Morningstar Credit total revenue increased $75.7 million, or 35.1%, in 2024. Revenue increased 35.3% on an organic basis. Ratings related revenue increased across asset classes and geographies as ratings activity rebounded compared to a relatively soft prior year, with particular strength in commercial mortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, and corporate ratings-related revenue. Recurring revenue, which is derived primarily from surveillance, research, and other transaction-related revenue, and also includes data licensing revenue, represented 41% of total Morningstar Credit revenue. 
Morningstar Credit adjusted operating income increased $53.9 million, or 248.4%, and adjusted operating margin increased 15.9 percentage points in 2024. Adjusted operating income and margin growth in 2024 was driven by increased revenue, partially offset by higher bonus expense in the year reflecting strong performance versus plan targets and the comparison to relatively low bonus expense in 2023. Prior-year operating expenses included $8.0 million related to the DBRS, Inc. SEC settlements and $1.7 million in severance related to targeted reorganizations.
Morningstar Credit depreciation expense was $8.9 million and $9.1 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Morningstar Wealth total revenue increased $18.5 million, or 8.0%, in 2024. Revenue grew 8.1% on an organic basis, primarily driven by growth in Investment Management. Organic revenue growth excludes platform revenue from the US TAMP from prior year starting in December, interim service fees received from AssetMark associated with the sale of US TAMP assets, and foreign currency impact.
Asset-based revenue is based on quarter-end, prior quarter-end, or average asset levels during each quarter, which are often reported on a one-quarter lag for certain Investment Management products including Morningstar Model Portfolios (also known as Morningstar Managed Portfolios). The timing of this client asset reporting and the structure of our contracts often results in a lag between market movements and the impact on revenue.

Interest income reflects interest from our cash, cash equivalents, and investment portfolio. Interest expense mainly relates to the outstanding principal balance under our Amended 2022 Credit Agreement and the $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2030 Notes.
Effective September 30, 2024, we sold our Commodity and Energy Data business within the Morningstar Data and Analytics segment for a purchase price of $52.4 million. In the third quarter of 2024, we recorded a $45.3 million gain on sale of business in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Expense from equity method transaction, net for 2023 primarily reflects the impact of the Termination Agreement (the Termination Agreement) with Morningstar Japan K.K.

Our effective tax rate in 2024 was 21.9%, an increase of 2.9 percentage points, compared with 19.0% in the prior year. Our 2024 effective rate was favorably impacted by the book gain in excess of taxable gain on the sale of our Commodity and Energy Data business and was offset by deferred taxes that we recorded with respect to unremitted foreign earnings. Further, our 2023 effective tax rate was lower primarily due to the recognition of tax benefits related to a retroactive tax election.
In October 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) agreed to a two-pillar approach to global taxation focusing on global profit allocation (Pillar One) and a global minimum tax rate (Pillar Two). In December 2022, the EU member states agreed to implement the OECD’s global corporate minimum tax rate of 15% under Pillar Two to be effective in January 2024. Other countries are also considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD’s proposals. This legislation represents a significant change in the international tax regime and could result in increases to our effective tax rate as a result of the imposition of minimum taxes. The Pillar Two minimum tax is treated as a period cost beginning in 2024 and did not have a material impact on our 2024 effective tax rate. We continue to monitor developments and administrative guidance in addition to evaluating the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements for future periods.
Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $551.0 million, up $162.0 million from the prior year. 
Cash provided by operating activities is our main source of cash. In 2024, cash provided by operating activities was $591.6 million, reflecting $498.8 million of net income adjusted for non-cash items and $92.8 million i
n 
positive changes from our net operating assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities increased $275.2 million, from $316.4 million

in

2023 primarily driven by higher cash earnings
.
Cash used for investing activities decreased $60.6 million from $81.9 million in 2023 to $21.3 million

in 2024, primarily driven by $65.0 million proceeds from 
sale of US TAMP assets in 2024
 and $52.4 million proceeds from sale of our Commodity and Energy Data business in 2024. This was offset by higher capital expenditures in 2024. 
Cash used for financing activities increased $106.0 million from $278.4 million in 2023 to $384.4 million in 2024. Financing cash flows were impacted by $274.4 million and $137.5 million net repayments to our financing arrangements in 2024 and 2023, respectively. On February 6, 2023, the company made its final $50.0 million contingent payment related to the acquisition of LCD, of which $4.5 million is reflected in operating cash flows and $45.5 million is reflected in financing cash flows.

Table of Contents

We believe our available cash balances and investments, along with cash generated from operations and our credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our operating and cash needs for at least the next 12 months. We are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. We hold our cash reserves in cash equivalents and investments and maintain a conservative investment policy. We invest most of our investment balance in stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, money market funds, or exchange-traded products that replicate the model portfolios and strategies created by Morningstar. These investment accounts may also include exchange-traded products where Morningstar is an index provider.
Approximately 76% of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments were held by our operations outside the US as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. We generally consider most of our US directly-owned foreign subsidiary earnings to be permanently reinvested. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we determined $142.0 million in earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to be no longer permanently reinvested. We anticipate a one-time repatriation of these earnings back to the US via distribution later in 2025. We have recorded a deferred tax liability of $7.1 million that reflects the income tax effects of the repatriation of these earnings, mostly due to non-US withholding taxes, that would be due at the time of remittance.
We intend to use our cash, cash equivalents, and investments for general corporate purposes, including working capital and funding future growth.
Credit Agreement
On May 6, 2022, the company entered into a senior credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement), providing the company with a five-year multi-currency credit facility with an initial borrowing capacity of up to $1.1 billion, including a $650.0 million term loan and a $450.0 million revolving credit facility. The 2022 Credit Agreement also provided for the issuance of letters of credit and a swingline facility. The 2022 Credit Agreement was amended twice in September 2022 and again most recently in June 2024 (Amended 2022 Credit Agreement) to, among other items, eliminate the options for a second term loan draw and increase both the term loan and revolving credit facility to $650.0 million each, raising the total borrowing capacity to $1.3 billion 
(Amended 2022 Term Facility and Amended 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, respectively), and to update the reference rate for credit extensions in Canadian dollars. Aside from the increased borrowing capacity, the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement left the 2022 Credit Agreement terms largely unchanged. 
As of December 31, 2024, our total outstanding debt under the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement was $349.8 million, net of debt issuance costs, with borrowing availability of $650.0 million under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility.
The interest rate applicable to any loan under the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement is, at the company's option, either: (i) the applicable Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus an applicable margin for such loans, which ranges between 1.00% and 1.48%, based on the company's consolidated leverage ratio or (ii) the lender's base rate plus the applicable margin for such loans, which ranges between 0.00% and 0.38%, based on our consolidated leverage ratio.
The portions of deferred debt issuance costs related to the Amended 2022 Revolving Credit Facility are included in other current and non-current assets, and the portion of deferred debt issuance costs related to the Amended 2022 Term Facility is reported as a reduction to the carrying amount of the Amended 2022 Term Facility. Debt issuance costs related to the Amended 2022 Revolving Credit Facility are amortized on a straight-line basis to interest expense over the term of the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement. Debt issuance costs related to the Amended 2022 Term Facility are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement.
Private Placement Debt Offering
On October 26, 2020, we completed the issuance and sale 
of $350.0 million a
ggregate principal amount of 2.32% senior notes due October 26, 2030 (the 2030 Notes), in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Proceeds were primarily used to pay off a portion of the company's outstanding debt under the prior credit agreement. Interest on the 2030 Notes will be paid semi-annually on each October 30 and April 30 during the term of the 2030 Notes and at maturity, with the first interest payment date occurring on April 30, 2021. As of December 31, 2024, our total outstanding debt, net of issuance costs, under the 2030 Notes was $348.8 million.

Compliance with Covenants
Each of the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement and the 2030 Notes include customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants, that require us to maintain specified ratios of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to consolidated interest charges and consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, which are evaluated on a quarterly basis. We were in compliance with these financial covenants as of
 December 31, 2024, with consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA calculated at approximately 0.9x.
Share Repurchases
On December 6, 2022, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes the company to repurchase up to $500.0 million in shares of the company's outstanding common stock, effective January 1, 2023. This authorization replaced the then-existing share repurchase program and expires on December 31, 2025. Under this authorization, we may repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing market prices on the open market or in private transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
For the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased a total of 33,300 shares for 
$11.6 million
. As of 
December 31, 2024
, we have repurchased a total of

41,784
 shares for $13.0 million under this authorization, leaving $487.0 million available for future repurchases.
Dividends
In 2024, we also paid dividends of $69.3 million. While subsequent dividends will be subject to board approval, we expect to make regular quarterly dividend payments of 45.5 cents per share in 2025.
 In December 2024, our board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of $0.455 per share, or $19.4 million, payable on January 31, 2025 to shareholders of record as of January 3, 2025.
Wealth Advisors
On January 27, 2023, we entered into the Termination Agreement and the Tender Offer Agreement. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, Wealth Advisors agreed to cease use of the Morningstar brand, and Morningstar and Wealth Advisors agreed to terminate the License Agreement originally entered into in 1998. As consideration for the transaction, Morningstar agreed to pay Wealth Advisors 8 billion Japanese yen upon the termination of the license agreement and the achievement of certain conditions related primarily to the termination of the use of the Morningstar brand by Wealth Advisors’ customers. 
On April 6, 2023, we made the first cash payment of 6 billion Japanese yen ($45.1 million), and on April 19, 2023, we made the second and final cash payment of 2 billion Japanese yen ($14.8 million), pursuant to the Termination Agreement.

As part of such transaction, pursuant to the Tender Offer Agreement, Morningstar agreed to tender up to 10 million shares in Wealth Advisors to SBI. The tender offer closed on February 28, 2023, and SBI purchased 8,040,600 shares of Wealth Advisors from Morningstar, resulting in net proceeds of $26.2 million and a pre-tax gain of $18.4 million. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Termination Agreement and the Tender Offer Agreement.
Other
We expect to continue making capital expenditures in 2025, primarily for computer hardware, software, and leasehold improvements for new and existing office locations.

Consolidated Free Cash Flow

As described in more detail above, free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures. We present free cash flow solely as a supplemental disclosure to help investors better understand how much cash is available after making capital expenditures. Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate the health of our business. Free cash flow is not a measure of performance. Also, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

We generated free cash flow of $448.9 million in 2024, an increase of $251.6 million compared with 2023. The change reflects a $275.2 million
 increase in cash provided by operating activities as well as a $23.6 million increase in capital expenditures. The increase in cash flow from operations and free cash flow was primarily driven by higher cash earnings.
In 2023, free cash flow was impacted by $4.5 million LCD contingent payment within operating cash flow, payments related to the Termination Agreement of $59.9 million, and $26.4 million of severance and other related costs paid for the China transition, which together totaled $90.8 million. Excluding these items and $1.8 million in severance related to the sale of US TAMP assets in 2024, free cash flow would have been $450.7 million and $288.1 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Acquisitions
We paid a total of $647.5 million, net of cash acquired, related to acquisitions over the past three years. We describe these acquisitions in Note 9 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
We paid a total of $40.4 million related to additional investments in unconsolidated entities over the past three years. We describe these investments in Note 11 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Divestitures

Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We discuss our significant accounting policies in Note 2 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires our management team to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expense, and related disclosures included in our Consolidated Financial Statements.
We continually evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable. Based on these assumptions and estimates, we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results could vary from these estimates and assumptions. If actual amounts are different from previous estimates, we include revisions in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.
We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements:
Revenue Recognition
A majority of our revenue comes from the sale of subscriptions for data, software, and Internet-based products and services. We recognize this revenue in equal amounts over the noncancellable term of the subscription or license, which generally ranges from one to three years. Our license-based revenue represents subscription services available to customers and not a license under the accounting guidance. We also provide research, investment management, retirement advice, and other services. We recognize this revenue when the service is provided or during the service obligation period defined in the contract.
We make judgments related to revenue recognition, including allocating the transaction price in a contract. For contracts that combine multiple products and services or other performance obligations, we make judgments regarding the value of each obligation in the arrangement based on selling prices of the items as if sold separately. We recognize revenue as we satisfy our performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers.
We make judgments at the beginning of an arrangement regarding whether collection of the consideration to which we are entitled is probable and assess the likelihood of collection on a customer-by-customer basis. We typically sell to institutional customers with whom we have a history of successful collections.
Deferred revenue is the amount billed or collected in advance for subscriptions or services that has not yet been recognized as revenue. Deferred revenue totaled $563.2 million at the end of 2024 (of which $540.8 million was classified as a current liability with an additional $22.4 million, mainly credit rating surveillance, included in long-term liabilities). We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill our performance obligations under our subscription and service agreements.
The amount of deferred revenue may increase or decrease based on the mix of contracted products and services and the volume of new and renewal subscriptions. The timing of future revenue recognition may change depending on the terms of the applicable agreements and the timing of fulfilling our service obligations. 
Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Assets
We generally acquire businesses which are accounted for as business combinations. Our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the transaction. We record the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition.
To account for each business combination, we utilize the acquisition method of accounting which requires the following steps (1) identifying the acquirer, (2) determining the acquisition date, (3) recognizing and measuring identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and (4) recognizing and measuring goodwill or a gain from a bargain purchase. 
73
Table of Contents

Regardless of whether an acquisition is considered to be a business combination or an asset acquisition, allocating the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities involves management judgment. We base the fair value estimates on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions that we believe are reasonable, but these estimates are inherently uncertain.
Determining the fair value of intangible assets requires significant management judgment in the following areas:
•
Identify the acquired intangible assets: For each acquisition, we identify the intangible assets acquired. These intangible assets generally consist of customer relationships, trademarks and trade names, technology-related intangibles (including internally developed software and databases), and in certain acquisitions, noncompete agreements.
•
Estimate the fair value of these intangible assets: We may consider various approaches to value the intangible assets. These include the cost approach, which measures the value of an asset based on the cost to reproduce it or replace it with another asset of like utility by applying the reproduction cost method or replacement cost method; the market approach, which values the asset through an analysis of sales and offerings of comparable assets which can be adjusted to reflect differences between the investment or asset being valued and the comparable investments or assets, such as historical financial condition and performance, expected economic benefits, time and terms of sale, utility, and physical characteristics, and the income approach, which measures the value of an asset based on the present value of the economic benefits it is expected to produce utilizing inputs such as estimated future cash flows based on forecasted revenue growth rates and margins, estimated attrition rates, and discount rate assumptions. 
•
Estimate the remaining useful life of the assets: For each intangible asset, we use judgment and assumptions to establish the remaining useful life of the asset. For example, for customer relationships, we determine the estimated useful life with reference to observed customer attrition rates. For technology-related assets such as databases, we make judgments about the demand for current data and historical metrics in establishing the remaining useful life. For internally developed software, we estimate an obsolescence factor associated with the software. 
We record any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired as goodwill, which is not amortized.
We recognize the fair value of any contingent payments at the date of acquisition as part of the consideration transferred to acquire a business. Contingent payments are recognized at fair value at the date of acquisition using either a Monte Carlo simulation, 
which requires the use of management assumptions and inputs, such as projected financial information related to revenue growth and expected margin percentage, among other valuation related items, or calculating the weighted average of the estimated contingent payment scenarios.
 The liability associated with contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting period subsequent to the date of acquisition considering factors that may impact the timing and amount of contingent payments until the term of the agreement has expired or the contingency is resolved. Any changes in the fair value measurement will be recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In evaluating the characterization of contingent and deferred payments, we analyze relevant factors, including the nature of the payment, continuing employment requirements, incremental payments to employees of the acquired business, and timing and rationale underlying the transaction, to determine whether the payments should be accounted for as additional purchase consideration or post-combination related services.
We believe the accounting estimates related to purchase price allocations, subsequent goodwill impairment testing, and contingent payments are critical accounting estimates because changes in these assumptions could materially affect the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as the amount of amortization and depreciation expense, if any, recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The significance of this policy varies from period to period depending upon the volume of applicable acquisition transactions occurring.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
Our investment portfolio is actively managed and may suffer losses from fluctuating interest rates, market prices, or adverse security selection. These accounts may consist of stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, money market funds, or exchange-traded products that replicate the model portfolios and strategies created by Morningstar. These investment accounts may also include exchange-traded products where Morningstar is an index provider. As of December 31, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents, and investments balance w
as $551.0 m
illion. Based on our estimates, a 100 basis-point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio.
We are subject to risk from fluctuations in the interest rates related to a portion of our long-term debt. The interest rates are based upon the applicable Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) rate plus an applicable margin for such loans or the lender's base rate plus an applicable margin for such loans. On an annualized basis, we estimate a 100 basis-point change in the SOFR rate would have a $3.5 million impact on our interest expense based on our outstanding principal balance and SOFR rates around December 31, 2024.
We are subject to risk from fluctuations in foreign currencies from our operations outside of the US. To date, we have not engaged in currency hedging, and we do not currently have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Morningstar, Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of the material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included in examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Evaluation of sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue
As discussed in Notes 2 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recorded $2,275.1 million in revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2024, which contain multiple product revenue streams. The Company's process to account for and recognize revenue differs between certain revenue streams.
We identified the evaluation of the sufficiency of the audit evidence over revenue as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained required especially subjective auditor judgement due to the multiple product revenue streams and the use of multiple processes to account for and recognize revenue. This included determining the nature and extent of audit evidence obtained over revenue.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We used auditor judgement to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed, including the determination of the revenue streams over which those procedures were performed. For product revenue streams where procedures were performed, we:
•
evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's revenue recognition processes
•
evaluated the Company's revenue recognition accounting policies
•
selected certain revenue transactions and assessed recorded amounts by comparing them for consistency with underlying documentation, including the customer contract
•
evaluated certain revenue transactions for consistency with the Company's accounting policies, as applicable, including timing of revenue recognition
In addition, we evaluated the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained by assessing the results of the procedures performed, including the appropriateness of the nature and extent of audit effort over revenue.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
Morningstar, Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Morningstar, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule II (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for the external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
78
Table of Contents

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

MORNINGSTAR, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.
Description of Business

Morningstar, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Morningstar, we, our, the company) provide independent investment insights for investors around the world. We offer an extensive line of products and services for individual and institutional investors in public and private capital markets, financial advisors, asset managers, retirement plan providers and sponsors, and issuers of securities. We conduct business operations through wholly-owned subsidiaries in 
32
 countries.
2. 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The acronyms that appear in these Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements refer to the following:
ASC
Accounting Standards Codification
ASU
Accounting Standards Update
FASB
Financial Accounting Standards Board
SEC
Securities and Exchange Commission
Principles of Consolidation
We conduct our business operations through wholly-owned operating subsidiaries. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Morningstar, Inc. and our subsidiaries. We consolidate assets, liabilities, and results of operations of subsidiaries in which we have a controlling interest and eliminate all significant intercompany accounts and transactions.
We account for investments in entities in which we exercise significant influence, but do not control, using the equity method. 
As part of our investment management operations, we manage certain funds outside of the US that are considered variable interest entities. For most of these variable interest entities, we do not have a variable interest. In cases where we do have a variable interest, we are not the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, we do not consolidate any of these variable interest entities.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the US (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less. We state them at cost, which approximates fair value. We state the portion of our cash equivalents that are invested in money market funds at fair value, as these funds are actively traded and have quoted market prices.
Investments
We account for our investments in debt securities in accordance with FASB ASC 320, 
Investments—Debt Securities
 (FASB ASC 320). We classify our debt securities into two categories: held-to-maturity and available-for-sale. 
•
Held-to-maturity: We classify certain investments, primarily certificates of deposit, as held-to-maturity securities, based on our intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. We record held-to-maturity investments at amortized cost in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
85
Table of Contents

•
Available-for-sale: Investments not considered held-to-maturity or trading securities are classified as available-for-sale securities. Available-for-sale securities primarily consist of marketable debt securities. We report unrealized gains and losses for available-for-sale securit
ies as other comprehensive income (loss), net of related income taxes. We record these securities at their fair values in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We account for our investments in equity securities in accordance with FASB ASC 321, 
Investments— Equity Securities
 (FASB ASC 321). We measure equity investments at fair value with the related realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized in
 our Consolidated Statements of Income
. For equity investments without a readily determinable fair value, we measure these at cost less impairment and adjusting for observable price changes in orderly transactions. We will apply this measurement method to the investment until or if it becomes eligible to be measured at fair value, which is reassessed at each reporting period. Investments in equity securities that we do not intend to hold for more than a year are presented in "Investments" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Investments in equity securities that we intend to hold for more than one year are included in "Investments in unconsolidated entities" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
We account for our equity method investments in accordance with FASB ASC 323, Investments 
— Equity Method and Joint Ventures 
(FASB ASC 323). We account for non-marketable equity investments over which we exercise significant influence, but do not have control over the investee, under the equity method. We record our estimated share of earnings or losses in the periods they are reported by the investee and record any dividends as a reduction to the carrying amount of the investment. We evaluate our equity method investments for other than-temporary declines in value. If the estimated fair value of the investment is less than the carrying amount and management considers the decline in value to be other than temporary, the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value is recognized in net income in the period the impairment occurs. Our equity method investments are recorded within "Investments in unconsolidated entities" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Fair Value Measurements
FASB ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements 
(FASB ASC 820) defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Under FASB ASC 820, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. 
FASB ASC 820 uses a fair value hierarchy based on three broad levels of valuation inputs:
•    
Level 1: Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access.
•    
Level 2: Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.
•    
Level 3: Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.
We provide additional information about our cash equivalents and investments that are subject to FASB ASC 820 in Note 7.
Business Combinations
When we acquire a business, we account for the business combination in accordance with FASB ASC 805, 
Business Combinations 
(FASB ASC 805). We recognize and measure the fair value of the acquired business and allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The difference between the purchase price and the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired or the excess of the aggregate estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. In determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, we use various recognized valuation methods, including discounted cash flow, Monte Carlo simulations, and relief from royalty. For a business combination achieved in stages, we remeasure our previously held equity interest immediately before the acquisition to the acquisition date fair value and recognize any gain in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
86
Table of Contents

We recognize the fair value of any contingent payments at the date of acquisition as part of the consideration transferred to acquire a business. The liability associated with contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting period subsequent to the date of acquisition considering factors that may impact the timing and amount of contingent payments until the term of the agreement has expired or the contingency is resolved. Any changes in the fair value measurement will be recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Income. In evaluating the characterization of contingent and deferred payments, we analyze relevant factors, including the nature of the payment, continuing employment requirements, incremental payments to employees of the acquired business, and timing and rationale underlying the transaction, to determine whether the payments should be accounted for as additional purchase consideration or post-combination related services.
We expense direct costs related to the business combination, such as accounting, legal, valuation, and other professional fees, as incurred. We recognize restructuring costs, including severance and relocation for employees of the acquired entity, as post-combination expenses unless the target entity meets the criteria of FASB ASC 420, 
Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations
, on the acquisition date. 
As part of the purchase price allocation, we follow the requirements of FASB ASC 740, 
Income Taxes 
(FASB ASC 740). This includes establishing deferred tax assets or liabilities reflecting the difference between the values assigned for financial statement purposes and income tax purposes. In certain acquisitions, the goodwill resulting from the purchase price allocation may not be deductible for income tax purposes. FASB ASC 740 prohibits recognition of a deferred tax asset or liability for temporary differences in goodwill if goodwill is not amortizable and deductible for tax purposes.
Divestitures

We may sell certain portions of our business from time to time for various reasons. In accordance with FASB ASC 360, 
Property, Plant, and Equipment
 (FASB ASC 360), we classify a disposal group to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: management commits to a plan to sell the disposal group; the disposal group is available for immediate sale; the sale and transfer of the disposal group is expected within one year; the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. A disposal group that is classified as held for sale is initially measured at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell and the assets are not depreciated or amortized.
If the disposal group meets the definition of a business, the goodwill within the reporting unit is allocated to the disposal group based on its relative fair value. When the disposal group is a component of a reporting unit, the remaining unallocated goodwill is assessed to determine if any triggering events have occurred in accordance with FASB ASC 350, 
Intangibles – Goodwill and Other
 (FASB ASC 350). We assess the fair value of a disposal group, less any costs to sell, each reporting period the disposal group remains classified as held for sale and report any subsequent changes as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the initial carrying value of the disposal group. 
We recognize a gain or loss on divestiture activity when we transfer control of the disposal group and when it is probable that we will collect substantially all of the related consideration.
Goodwill
Changes in the carrying amount of our recorded goodwill are mainly the result of business acquisitions and the effect of foreign currency translations. In accordance with FASB ASC 350, we do not amortize goodwill; instead, goodwill is subject to an impairment test annually, or whenever indicators of impairment exist. An impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit. 
87
Table of Contents

When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we assess a number of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying values. Examples of qualitative factors that we assess include macroeconomic conditions affecting our reporting units, financial performance of our reporting units, market and competitive factors related to our reporting units, and other events specific to our reporting units. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative impairment test. The quantitative impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, and recognizes an impairment loss for the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We determine the fair value of a reporting unit using a market approach. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions, which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows, as well as revenue and earnings multiples of publicly traded companies whose services and markets are comparable.
We performed our annual impairment review in the fourth quarter and did not record any impairment losses in 2024, 2023, and 2022.
Intangible Assets
We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 
one
 to 
twenty years
. We have no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. In accordance with FASB ASC 360-10-35, 
Subsequent Measurement—Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets
, we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the value of future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset group, we record an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset group. We did not record any impairment losses in 2024
, 
2023, and 2022.
Property, Equipment, and Depreciation
We state property and equipment at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation in accordance with FASB ASC 360-10, 
Property, Plant, and Equipment
. We depreciate property and equipment using the straight-line method based on the useful life of the asset, which ranges from 
three
 to 
seven years
. We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter. Long-lived assets that are held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the value of future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset group, we record an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset group.

Computer Software and Intern
al Product Development Costs
We capitalize certain costs in accordance with FASB ASC 350-40, 
Internal-Use Software
. Inter
nal product development costs mainly consist of employee and third-party resource costs for developing new web-based products and certain major enhancements of existing products. We amortize these costs on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life, which is generally 
three years
. We include capitalized software development costs related to projects that have not been placed into service in our construction in progress balance.

Leases
We account for our right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in accordance with FASB ASC 842, 
Leases 
(FASB ASC 842)
. 
We determine if a contract is or contains a lease at the inception of the contract. For identified operating leases, we recognize a lease liability and right-of-use asset on the consolidated balance sheet. The right-of-use asset represents our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and the operating lease liability represents the company's obligation to make lease payments.
Our lease agreements consist primarily of real estate leases for office space and non-real estate leases for office equipment. In cases where an agreement contains both a lease and non-lease component, we do not allocate consideration to both components, but account for each as a single lease component by class of underlying asset. There are few instances of short-term agreements in our lease portfolio, which are typically arranged as needed and paid on a month-to-month basis. These leases are not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, but monthly lease expense is recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
Right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities are measured using the present value of future lease payments of the lease term at the commencement date. Right-of-use assets also include initial direct costs incurred by the company, net of prepayments and lease incentives. In the absence of an explicit rate in the lease agreement, the discount rate used to calculate present value is equal to the company's incremental borrowing rate. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease and is included in general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenue in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 606,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
 (FASB ASC Topic 606). 
Under FASB ASC Topic 606, we recognize revenue by applying the following five-step model to each of our customer arrangements:
1.
Identify the customer contract; 
2.
Identify the performance obligations in the contract; 
3.
Determine the transaction price; 
4.
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and
5.
Recognize revenue when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied.
Revenues are recognized when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied by transferring a promised product or service to the customer. Products or services are transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of the product or service. When a customer’s license-based contract is signed, the customer’s service is activated immediately. The transaction price for a customer arrangement is the amount we expect to be entitled to in exchange for transferring the promised product or service. The transaction price may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both. When the right to payment exceeds revenue recognized, the result is an increase to deferred revenue. Deferred revenue represents the amount billed or collected in advance of the service being provided which we expect to recognize as revenue in future periods.
Revenue from contracts with customers is derived from license-based arrangements, asset-based arrangements, and transaction-based arrangements.
License-based revenue, which represents subscription services available to customers and not a license under the accounting guidance, is generated through subscription contracts. Our performance obligations under these contracts are typically satisfied over time, as the customer has access to the service during the term of the subscription license and the level of service is consistent during the contract period. Each individual day within the contract period is viewed to be a service and the entirety of the service subscription term is determined to be a series combined into a single performance obligation and recognized over-time and on a straight-line basis, typically over terms of 
1
 to 
3
 years.
89
Table of Contents

Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For most of these arrangements, we generally allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on its estimated standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on prices charged to customers when the same performance obligation is sold separately.
License-based arrangements, our largest source of revenue from customers, generally are billed quarterly or annually. Customers are typically given payment terms of 
zero
 to 
30
 days. 
Asset-based revenue is generated through contracts with daily asset management, which is determined to be a daily performance obligation and thus satisfied over time as the customer receives continuous access to a service for the contract term. We recognize revenue daily over the contract term based on the value of assets under management and a tiered fee agreed to with the customer. Asset-based arrangements typically have a term of 
1
 to 
3
 years. The fees from such arrangements represent variable consideration, and the customer does not make separate purchasing decisions that result in additional performance obligations. Significant changes in the underlying fund assets, or significant disruptions in the market, are evaluated to determine if revisions to estimates of earned asset-based fees for the current quarter are needed. An estimate of the average daily portfolio balance is a key input in determining revenue for a given period. Estimates are based on the most recently reported quarter, and, as a result, it is unlikely a significant reversal of revenue would occur. 
Transaction-based revenue is generated through contracts with performance obligations that are satisfied when the product or service is delivered. Some of our performance obligations include the issuance of the rating and may include surveillance services for a period of time as agreed with the customer. We allocate the transaction price to the deliverables based on their relative selling price, which is generally determined by the historical pricing allocations. Our performance obligation for the issuance of the rating is satisfied when the rating is issued, which is when we recognize the related revenue. Our performance obligations for surveillance services are satisfied over time, as the customer has access to the service during the surveillance period and the level of service is consistent during the contract period. Therefore, we recognize revenue for this performance obligation on a straight-line basis.
Accounts Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses
We account for accounts receivable in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 310, 
Receivables
 (FASB ASC 310) and FASB ASC Topic 326, 
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
 (FASB ASC 326). We record a receivable when a customer is billed or when revenue is recognized prior to billing a customer. Accounts receivables are measured at amortized cost basis. We evaluate our allowance to include expected credit losses based on a variety of factors, including customer specific information, the current economic environment, and forecasted macroeconomic conditions.
Sales Commissions
We capitalize sales commissions, which are considered directly attributable to obtaining a customer contract under FASB ASC Topic 606 and FASB ASC 340-40, 
Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers
. Estimates of these capitalized costs are developed by using a portfolio approach that aggregates these costs by legal entity within their geographical regions. Capitalized sales commissions are amortized using the straight-line method over a period that is consistent with the transfer of the products or services to the customer to which the sales commission relates. The period of transfer for each portfolio is the shorter of the weighted-average customer life, or the economic life of the underlying technology that delivers the products or services. As of December 31, 2024, the period of transfer was determined to be approximately 
three years
. Discretionary amounts which are added to sales commission payments are expensed as incurred, as they are not considered to be directly attributable to obtaining a customer contract.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense
We account for our stock-based compensation expense in accordance with FASB ASC 718, 
Compensation—Stock Compensation 
(FASB ASC 718). Our stock-based compensation expense reflects grants of restricted stock units, market stock units, and performance stock units. We measure the fair value of our restricted stock units and performance stock units on the grant date based on the closing market price of Morningstar's common stock on the day prior to the grant. For market stock units, we estimate the fair value of the awards using a Monte Carlo valuation model. We amortize the fair values to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period. For performance stock units, we estimate the probability of award achievement and adjust our stock-based compensation expense accordingly.
We estimate expected forfeitures on employee stock-based awards and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest. We determine forfeiture rates based on historical experience and adjust the estimated forfeitures to actual forfeiture experience, as needed.
Income Taxes
We record deferred income taxes for the temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement purposes and tax purposes in accordance with FASB ASC 740, which prescribes the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. It also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, and disclosure for uncertain tax positions.
We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We classify liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as either current or long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, depending on when we expect to make payment.
Segment Reporting
Under FASB ASC 280, 
Segment Reporting
 (FASB ASC 280), operating segments are defined as components of a company that engage in business activities from which they may earn revenues and incur expenses, and for which discrete financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Aggregation of similar operating segments into a single reportable operating segment is permitted if the businesses have similar economic characteristics and meet established qualitative criteria. 
Effective as of December 31, 2023, we revised our presentation of our 
seven
 operating segments to the following 
five
 reportable segments: Morningstar Data and Analytics, PitchBook, Morningstar Credit, Morningstar Wealth, and Morningstar Retirement. The operating segments of Morningstar Sustainalytics and Morningstar Indexes do not individually meet the quantitative segment reporting thresholds and have been combined and presented as part of Corporate and All Other, which is not a reportable segment. Corporate and All Other provides a reconciliation between revenue from our reportable segments and consolidated revenue amounts. Refer to Note 6 for detailed segment information.

Severance
We account for post-employment benefits in accordance with FASB ASC 712, 
Compensation - Non-retirement Post-employment Benefits 
(FASB ASC 712). Under FASB ASC 712, we recognize compensation expense associated with these benefits as a liability when probable and estimable. 
In July 2022, the company began to significantly reduce its operations in Shenzhen, China and to shift the work related to its global business functions, including global product and software development, managed investment data collection and analysis, and equity data collection and analysis, to other Morningstar locations. During the third quarter of 2023, the company substantially completed these activities.
As a result of these activities, the company incurred $
25.9
 million of severance expense in 2022. These amounts were recorded within "General and administrative" on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The liability was recorded within "Accrued compensation - current" on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The company has substantially paid all of the accrued severance amounts as of December 31, 2023.

In 2023, the company incurred $
15.4
 million of severance expense of which $
9.0
 million was related to targeted reorganizations and headcount reductions in certain parts of the business and $

Credit Agreement
On May 6, 2022, the company entered into a senior credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement), providing the company with a five-year multi-currency credit facility with an initial borrowing capacity of up to $
1.1
 billion, including a $
650.0
 million term loan and a $
450.0
 million revolving credit facility. The 2022 Credit Agreement also provided for the issuance of letters of credit and a swingline facility. The 2022 Credit Agreement was amended twice in September 2022 and again most recently in June 2024 (Amended 2022 Credit Agreement) to, among other items, eliminate the options for a second term loan draw and increase both the term loan and revolving credit facility to $
650.0
 million each, raising the total borrowing capacity to $
1.3
 billion 
(Amended 2022 Term Facility and Amended 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, respectively), and to update the reference rate for credit extensions in Canadian dollars. Aside from the increased borrowing capacity, the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement left the 2022 Credit Agreement terms largely unchanged. 
As of December 31, 2024, our total outstanding debt under the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement was $
349.8
 million, net of debt issuance costs, with borrowing availability of $

Private Placement Debt Offering
On October 26, 2020, we completed the issuance and sale 
of $
350.0

ggregate principal amount of 
2.32
% senior notes due October 26, 2030 (the 2030 Notes), in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Proceeds were primarily used to pay off a portion of the company's outstanding debt under the prior credit agreement. Interest on the 2030 Notes will be paid semi-annually on each October 30 and April 30 during the term of the 2030 Notes and at maturity, with the first interest payment date occurring on April 30, 2021. As of December 31, 2024, our total outstanding debt, net of issuance costs, under the 2030 Notes was $
348.8
 million.
Compliance with Covenants
Each of the Amended 2022 Credit Agreement and the 2030 Notes include customary representations, warranties, and covenants, including financial covenants, that require us to maintain specified ratios of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to consolidated interest charges and consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, which are evaluated on a quarterly basis. We were in compliance with these financial covenants as

Starting with the quarter ended March 31, 2023, revenue from Morningstar Credit data products was reclassified from transaction-based to license-based. Prior periods have not been restated to reflect the updated classifications. 
Contract liabilities 
Our contract liabilities represent deferred revenue. We record contract liabilities when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which may be refundable. The contract liabilities balance as of December 31, 2024 had a net increase of $
19.2
 million, primarily driven by cash payments received or payable in advance of satisfying our performance obligations. We rec
ogniz
ed $
480.5
 million of revenue in 2024 that was included in the contract liabilities balance as of December 31, 2023.
We expect to recognize revenue related to our contract liabilities, including future billings, for 2025 and subsequent years as follows:

Table of Contents

The table above does not include variable consideration for unsatisfied performance obligations related to certain of our license-based, asset-based, and transaction-based contracts as of December 31, 2024. We are applying the optional exemption available under FASB ASC Topic 606, as the variable consideration relates to these unsatisfied performance obligations being fulfilled as a series. The performance obligations related to these contracts are expected to be satisfied over the next 
1
 to 
3
 years as services are provided to the client. For certain license-based contracts, variable consideration is received for services performed is based on the number of future users, which is not known until the services are performed. The variable consideration for this revenue can be affected by the number of user licenses, which cannot be reasonably estimated. For asset-based contracts, all the consideration received for services performed is based on future asset values, which are not known until the services are performed. The variable consideration for this revenue can be affected by changes in the underlying value of fund assets due to client redemptions, additional investments, or movements in the market. For transaction-based contracts, the consideration received for most Internet advertising services performed is based on the number of impressions, which is not known until the impressions are created. The variable consideration for this revenue can be affected by the timing and quantity of impressions in any given period and cannot be reasonably estimated.
As of December 31, 2024, the table above also does not include revenue for unsatisfied performance obligations related to certain of our license-based and transaction-based contracts with durations of one year or less since we are applying the optional exemption under FASB ASC Topic 606. For certain license-based contracts, the remaining performance obligation is expected to be less than one year based on the corresponding subscription terms or the existence of cancellation terms that may be exercised causing the contract term to be less than one year from December 31, 2024. For transaction-based contracts, such as new credit rating issuances and Morningstar-sponsored conferences, the related performance obligations are expected to be satisfied within the next 12 months.
Contract Assets
Our contract assets represent accounts receivable, less allowance for credit losses, and deferred commissions.

Segment and Geographical Area Information
Segment Information 
Our segments are generally organized around the company's product offerings. The company concluded that it has 
seven
 operating segments which are presented as the following 
five
 reportable segments: 
•
Morningstar Data and Analytics
•
PitchBook
•
Morningstar Credit
•
Morningstar Wealth
•
Morningstar Retirement
The operating segments of Morningstar Sustainalytics and Morningstar Indexes do not individually meet the quantitative segment reporting thresholds and have been combined and presented as part of Corporate and All Other, which is not a reportable segment. Corporate and All Other provides a reconciliation between revenue from our total reportable segments and consolidated revenue amounts.
Morningstar Data and Analytics provides investors comprehensive data, research and insights, and investment analysis to empower investment decision-making. Morningstar Data and Analytics includes product areas such as Morningstar Data, Morningstar Direct, and Morningstar Advisor Workstation.
95
Table of Contents

PitchBook provides investors with access to a broad collection of data and research covering the private capital markets, including venture capital, private equity, private credit and bank loans, and merger and acquisition (M&A) activities. Investors can also access Morningstar's data and research on public equities.
Morningstar Credit provides investors with credit ratings, research, data, and credit analytics solutions that contribute to the transparency of international and domestic credit markets. Morningstar Credit includes the Morningstar DBRS product area and the Morningstar Credit data and credit analytics product areas.
Morningstar Wealth brings together our model portfolios and wealth platform; practice and portfolio management software for registered investment advisers; data aggregation and enrichment capabilities; and our individual investor platform. Morningstar Wealth includes the Investment Management product area.
Morningstar Retirement offers products designed to help individuals reach their retirement goals. Its offerings include managed retirement accounts, fiduciary services, Morningstar Lifetime Allocation funds, and custom models.
FASB ASC 280 establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the CODM, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The company's chief executive officer, who is considered to be its CODM, reviews segme
nt revenue 
and Segment Adjusted Operating Income presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. For each segment, the CODM uses segment revenue and Segment Adjusted Operating Income in the annual budget and forecasting process. The CODM considers budget-to-actual variance when making decisions about allocating capital and personnel. 
We define Segment Adjusted Operating Income as operating income excluding all mergers and acquisitions (M&A)-related expenses and gains (related to merger, acquisition, and divestiture activity including earn-outs), intangible amortization, and expenses related to the significant reduction and shift of the company's operations in China. The CODM does not consider these adjustments for the purposes of making decisions to allocate resources among segments or to assess segment performance. Although the amounts are excluded from segment Adjusted Operating Income, they are included in reported consolidated operating income and are included in the reconciliation to consolidated results. Expenses presented as part of the company's segments include allocations of shared costs. Shared costs include technology, investment research, sales, facilities, and marketing. These allocations are based on expected utilization of shared resources. Adjusted Operating Income is the reported measure that the company believes is most consistent with those used in measuring the corresponding amount in the consolidated financial statements.
The CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a segment basis. Operating segments do not record intersegment revenues; therefore, there is none to be reported. 
The following tables present information about the company’s reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 along with the items necessary to reconcile the segment information to the totals reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Prior period segment information is presented on a comparable basis to the basis on which current period segment information is presented and reviewed by the CODM.

Investments 
We classify our investments into two categories: equity investments and debt securities. We further classify our debt securities into available-for-sale and held-to-maturity
. Our investment portfolio consists of stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, money market funds, or 
exchange-traded products that replicate the model portfolios and strategies created by Morningstar. These investment accounts may als
o include exchange-traded products where Morningstar is an index provider. All investments in our investment portfolio have valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access, and, therefore, are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.

We classify our investment portfolio as shown below:

In 2024, our investment in SmartX Advisory Solutions was measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis due to the identification of an impairment trigger, leading to $
12.4
 million of impairment losses. The fair value was estimated using an income approach with significant, unobservable inputs which include the extent and timing of future cash flows, revenue growth rates, and discount rates. Refer to Note 11 for more information about SmartX Advisory Solutions.

2022 Acquisitions
Leveraged Commentary & Data (LCD) 
On June 1, 2022, we completed our acquisition of LCD, a market leader in news, research, data, insights, and indexes for the leveraged finance market, from S&P for an initial cash payment of $
600.0
 million plus a contingent payment of up to $
50.0
 million. We began consolidating the financial results of LCD in our consolidated financial statements as of June 1, 2022.
102
Table of Contents

The total consideration transferred was recorded as $
645.5
 million, comprised of a $
600.0
 million cash payment plus contingent consideration with an acquisition date fair value of $
45.5
 million.
The transaction was accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting pursuant to FASB ASC 805, which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. We finalized the purchase price allocation related to our acquisition of LCD during the second quarter of 2023 and did not record any significant adjustments compared to the preliminary estimates at the date of acquisition. 
The final contingent consideration was determined based upon the achievement of certain conditions related to the separation of LCD’s contractual relationships from S&P contracts that include other S&P products and services during the six-month period following closing. To estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration at the acquisition date, we calculated the weighted average of the estimated contingent payment scenarios. At subsequent balance sheet dates, the contingent consideration was measured at fair value and any changes in the estimate were recorded in earnings unless the change in fair value was the result of facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. During the third and fourth quarters of 2022, the contingent consideration was remeasured and increased by $
0.9
 million and $
3.6
 million, respectively, for total consideration of $
50.0
 million as of December 31, 2022.
 Th
e contingent consideration is classified as "Contingent consideration liabilities" on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022. On February 6, 2023, we made a cash payment of $
50.0
 million, resolving our contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of LCD.

hich are presented as the following 
five
 reportable segments: 
Morningstar Data and Analytics, PitchBook, Morningstar Wealth, Morningstar Credit, and Morningstar Retirement. The company's operating segments also represent the company's reporting units to which goodwill is assigned. The company allocated goodwill by reporting unit in accordance with FASB ASC 350 
Intangibles—Goodwill and Other
 (FASB ASC 350). 
Under this reporting unit structure, the consolidated goodwill balance was allocated based on each reporting unit's relative fair value at January 1, 2021. The company used a market approach and assigned goodwill to the reporting units. The following table shows the changes in our goodwill balances from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2024:

On January 27, 2023, we entered into a Termination Agreement (the Termination Agreement) with Morningstar Japan K.K. (now known as SBI Global Asset Management Co., Ltd. (Wealth Advisors)), and a Tender Offer Agreement (the Tender Offer Ag
reement) with SBI Global Asset Management Co., Ltd
. (now known as SBI Asset Management Group Co., Ltd. (SBI
)).
106
Table of Contents

Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, Wealth Advisors agreed to cease use of the Morningstar brand, and Morningstar and Wealth Advisors agreed to terminate the License Agreement originally entered into in 1998. As consideratio
n for the transaction, Morningstar agreed to pay Wealth Advisors 
8
 billion Japanese yen upon the termination of t
he license agreement and the achievement of certain conditions related primarily to the termination of the use of the Morningstar brand by Wealth Advisors’ customers. 
On April 6, 2023, we made the first cash payment of 
6
 billion Japanese yen ($
45.1
 million), and on April 19, 2023, we made the second and final cash payment of 
2
 billion Japanese yen ($
14.8
 million), pursuant to the Termination Agreement. The expense related to the Termination Agreement is recorded within "Expense from equity method transaction, net" in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2023.
As part of this transaction, pursuant to the Tender Offer Agreement, Morningstar agreed to tender up to 
10
 million shares in Wealth Advisors to SBI. The tender offer closed on February 28, 2023, and SBI purchased 
8,040,600
 shares of Wealth Advisors from Morningstar, resulting in net proceeds of $
26.2
 million and a pre-tax gain of $
18.4
 million. The pre-tax gain is recorded within "Expense from equity method transaction, net" in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2023.
Immediately following the tender offer, the company's ownership percentage in Wealth Advisors decreased to 
13.2
% from 
22.1
%, and as a result, we no longer account for our investment in Wealth Advisors as an equity method investment. Each reporting period, we remeasure our remaining investment in Wealth Advisors, an equity security with a readily determinable value, at fair value and recognize unrealized holding gains or losses within "Other income (expense), net" on our Consolidated Statements of Income. During the first quarter of 2023, we recognized an unrealized holding gain of $
31.2
 million, which is recorded within "Expense from equity method transaction, net" in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
As of December 31, 2024, $
12.8
 million of our investment in Wealth Advisors is included in "Investments" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The carrying amount of other investments in unconsolidated entities without a readily determinable fair value, including our investment in SmartX Advisory Solutions, was $
41.1
 million and $
49.9
 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We recorded a $

Leases 
We lease office space and certain equipment under various operating and finance leases, with most of our lease portfolio consisting of operating leases for office space. 
We determine whether an arrangement is, or includes, an embedded lease at contract inception. Operating lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date and initially measured using the present value of lease payments over the defined lease term. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, we also recognize a finance lease asset and finance lease liability at inception, with lease expense recognized as interest expense and amortization. 
A contract is or contains an embedded lease if the contract meets all of the below criteria: 
•
there is an identified asset;
•
we obtain substantially all the economic benefits of the asset; and
•
we have the right to direct the use of the asset.
For initial measurement of the present value of lease payments and for subsequent measurement of lease modifications, we are required to use the rate implicit in the lease, if available. However, as most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate, which is a collateralized rate. To apply the incremental borrowing rate, we used a portfolio approach and grouped leases based on similar lease terms in a manner whereby we reasonably expect that the application does not differ materially from a lease-by-lease approach.
Our leases have remaining lease terms of approximately 
1
 year to 
11
 years, which may include the option to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain we will exercise that option. We do not have lease agreements with residual value guarantees, sale leaseback terms, or material restrictive covenants. 
Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the balance sheet. We recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Our operating lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $
44.1
 million, $
47.6
 million, and $
41.6
 million, respectively. Charges related to our operating leases that are variable and, therefore, not included in the measurement of the lease liabilities were $
14.9
 million and $
18.0
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We made lease payments of $
43.9
 million and $
45.3
 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

Our shareholders approved the Morningstar, Inc. Amended and Restated 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2021 Plan) on May 14, 2021 and authorized an additional 
1,050,000
 shares for issuance under the 2021 Plan. The 2021 Plan amended and restated the Morningstar, Inc. 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2011 Plan), which itself had amended and restated the Morningstar, Inc. 2004 Stock Incentive Plan.
The 2021 Plan provides for a variety of equity-based awards, including restricted stock units, restricted stock, performance stock units, market stock units, and stock options. Under the 2021 Plan, we primarily grant restricted stock units, market stock units, and performance stock units. Under the 2011 Plan, we primarily granted restricted stock units, stock options, and market stock units.
All officers, other employees, non-employee directors, and consultants or other independent contractors of the company and its subsidiaries and persons expected to become the same are eligible to receive awards under the 2021 Plan.
Shares delivered under the 2021 Plan may be authorized but unissued shares, or authorized but issued shares that we reacquired and held as treasury shares or otherwise, or any combination of the foregoing. The 2021 Plan does not permit the replenishment of its share reserve with shares withheld by the company to pay the exercise price of an option or to pay tax withholdings on any award. Further, the 2021 Plan prohibits the replenishment of the share reserve with shares that are not issued as a result of the net settlement of a stock option or stock appreciation right (SAR) or shares that are repurchased on the open market using proceeds from the exercise of a stock option.

In accordance with FASB ASC 718, we estimate forfeitures of employee stock-based awards and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest. 

Restricted Stock Units

RSUs represent the right to receive a share of Morningstar common stock when that unit vests. RSUs granted to employees typically vest within a 
four
-year period. RSUs granted to non-employee directors vest ratably over a 
three
-year period.
We measure the fair value of our RSUs on the grant date based on the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the day prior to grant. We amortize that value to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.

Market Stock Units
MSUs represent the right to receive a target number of shares that will vest at the end of a 
three
-year performance period depending on the company’s total shareholder return over that three-year period. The MSUs granted to the executive officers and certain other employees in 2021, 2022, and 2023 also had a feature to provide an increased number of shares to be earned at the vesting date, if certain revenue metrics were exceeded.
We measure the fair value of our MSUs on the grant date using a Monte Carlo valuation model. We amortize that value to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.

Performance Stock Units
PSUs represent the right to receive a target number of shares that will vest at the end of a 
three
-year performance period depending on the company's financial results over that three-year period. In 2024, the company awarded PSU opportunities to certain members of management (stretch PSUs). The number of PSUs that shall be eligible to be earned is based on adjusted operating income as of the end of the performance period. However, no PSUs will be earned unless performance exceeds the target performance level set by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the company.
We measure the fair value of our PSUs on the grant date based on the closing market price of the underlying common stock on the day prior to grant. We amortize that value to stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period.
In 2023, we renewed the PitchBook management bonus plan, a compensation vehicle designed to incentivize PitchBook leadership (the PitchBook Plan) for the 2023-2025 period. Pursuant to the terms of this renewal, awards having an aggregate target value equal to $
28.6
 million would have been available for issuance with annual grants of $
7.15
 million for 2023, $
7.15

Defined-Contribution Plan
We sponsor a defined-contribution 401(k) plan, which allows our US-based employees to voluntarily contribute pretax dollars up to a maximum amount allowable by the US Internal Revenue Service. In 2024, 2023, and 2022, we made matching contributions to our 401(k) plan in an amount equal to 
75
 cents for every dollar of an employee's contribution, up to a maximum of 
7
% of the employee's compensation in the pay period.

Our effective tax rate in 
2024
 was 
21.9
%, an increase of 
2.9
 percentage points, compared with 
19.0
% in the prior year. The company's effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the book gain in excess of taxable gain on the sale of its Commodity and Energy Data business and was offset by deferred taxes that we recorded with respect to unremitted foreign earnings. Further, our 2023 effective tax rate was lower primarily due to the recognition of tax benefits related to a retroactive tax election.
Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 
2023
 was 
19.0
%, a decrease of 
25.5
 percentage points, compared with 
44.5
% in 
2022
. 
The decrease is 
primarily attributable to the recognition of $
13.7
 million of tax benefits related to a retroactive tax election with respect to our 2021 and 2022 tax periods that was made in 2022 but not approved until 2023. We received confirmation of the approval of the tax election in the second quarter of 2023, which allowed us to recognize the tax benefits in that period.

Table of Contents

In October 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) agreed to a two-pillar approach to global taxation focusing on global profit allocation (Pillar One) and a global minimum tax rate (Pillar Two). In December 2022, the EU member states agreed to implement the OECD’s global corporate minimum tax rate of 15% under Pillar Two to be effective in January 2024. Other countries are also considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD’s proposals. This legislation represents a significant change in the international tax regime and could result in increases to our effective tax rate as a result of the imposition of minimum taxes. The Pillar Two minimum tax is treated as a period cost beginning in 2024 and did not have a material impact on our 2024 effective tax rate. We continue to monitor developments and administrative guidance in addition to evaluating the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements for future periods.
The amount of accumulated undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries was

$
304.0
 mi
llion as of December 31, 2024. We ge
neral
ly consider most of our US directly-owned foreign subsidiary earnings to be permanently reinvested
. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we determined $
142.0
 million in earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to be no longer permanently reinvested. We anticipate a one-time repatriation of these earnings back the US via distribution later in 2025. We have recorded a deferred tax liability of $
7.1
 million that reflects the income tax effects of the repatriation of these earnings, mostly due to non-US withholding taxes, that would be due at the time of remittance. We have not recorded deferred income taxes on the remaining balance of accumulated undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we consider those earnings to be permanently reinvested, and we do not anticipate dividends in the foreseeable future.

The net decrease in our valuation allowance, from $
26.3
 million at December 31, 2023 to $
26.2
 million at December 31, 2024, is primarily attributable to current year movements in net operating losses, capital losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards for which amounts are able to realized or for which full realization is uncertain. Included in the valuation allowance of $
26.2
 million are $
9.7
 million of foreign tax credits that will expire in 2031 through 2034. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, many factors are considered, including the specific taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward period, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits
We conduct business globally and, as a result, we file income tax returns in US federal, state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world. The open tax years for our US Federal tax returns and most state tax returns include the years 2020 to the present. 
We are currently under audit by state and local tax authorities in the US as well as tax authorities in certain non-US jurisdictions. It is likely that the examination phase of some of these state, local, and non-US audits will conclude in 2025. It is not possible to estimate the effect of current audits on previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits.
As of December 31, 2024, our Consolidated Balance Sheet included a current liability of $
0.1
 million and a non-current liability of $
11.7
 million for unrecognized tax benefits. As of December 31, 2023, our Consolidated Balance Sheet included a current liability of $
6.2
 million and a non-current liability of $
8.3
 million for unrecognized tax benefits. These amounts include interest and penalties, less any associated tax benefits.

. 
Contingencies
We record accrued liabilities for litigation, regulatory, and other business matters when those matters represent loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In these cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. Unless a loss contingency is both probable and estimable, we do not establish an accrued liability. As litigation, regulatory, or other business matters develop, we evaluate on an ongoing basis whether such matters present a loss contingency that is probable and estimable.
Data Audits and Reviews
In our global data business, we include in our products, or directly redistribute to our customers, data and information licensed from third-party vendors. Our compliance with the terms of these licenses is reviewed internally and is also subject to audit by the third-party vendors. At any given time, we may be undergoing several such internal reviews and third-party vendor audits, and the results and findings may indicate that we may be required to make a payment for prior data usage. Due to a lack of available information and data, as well as potential variations of any audit or internal review findings, we generally are not able to reasonably estimate a possible loss, or range of losses, for these matters. In situations where more information or specific areas subject to audit are available, we may be able to estimate a potential range of losses. While we cannot predict the outcome of these processes, we do not anticipate they will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial position. 
Ratings and Regulatory Matters
Our ratings and related research activities, including credit ratings, ESG risk ratings, managed investment, and equity ratings, are or may in the future become subject to regulation or increased scrutiny from executive, legislative, regulatory, and private parties. As a result, those activities may be subject to governmental, regulatory, and legislative investigations, regulatory examinations in the ordinary course of business, subpoenas, and other forms of legal process, which may lead to claims and litigation that are based on these ratings and related research activities. Our regulated businesses are generally subject to periodic reviews, inspections, examinations, and investigations by regulators in the jurisdictions in which they operate, any of which may result in claims, legal proceedings, assessments, fines, penalties, disgorgement, or restrictions on business activities. While it is difficult to predict the outcome of any particular investigation or proceeding, we do not believe the result of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial position.
Other Matters
We are involved from time to time in commercial disputes and legal proceedings that arise in the normal course of our business. While it is difficult to predict the outcome of any particular dispute or proceeding, we do not believe the result of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial position.

Share Repurchase Program
On December 6, 2022, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorizes the company to repurchase up to
 $
500.0
 million 
in shares of the company's outstanding common stock, effective January 1, 2023. This authorization replaced the then-existing share repurchase program and expires on December 31, 2025.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently adopted accounting pronouncements
Reference Rate Reform:
 In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04: 
Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting 
(Topic 848) (ASU No. 2020-04), which provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contract modifications resulting from reference rate reform initiatives. The intention of the standard is to ease the potential accounting and financial reporting burden associated with transitioning away from the expiring London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates to alternative benchmark rates. The amendments in this update are applicable to contract modifications that replace a reference LIBOR rate beginning on March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. 
On May 6, 2022
, we terminated our
 2019 Credit Agreement and entered into t
he 2022 Credit Agreement
 in connection with the acquisition of LCD. As we entered into the 2022 Credit Agreement for reasons unrelated to reference rate reform, ASU No. 2020-04 is not applicable. See Note 3 for additional information on our 2022 Credit Agreement and Note 9 for additional information on our acquisition of LCD.
Business Combinations: 
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08: 
Business Combinations
: 
Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers
 (Topic 805) (ASU No. 2021-08), which requires contract assets and contract liabilities (i.e., deferred revenue) acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with FASB ASC 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
. The new standard was effective for us on January 1, 2023. We elected to early adopt ASU No. 2021-08 during 2022 and the adoption did not have a materi
al effect on our consolidated financial statements, related disclosures, and results of operations.
Segment reporting: 
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07:
 Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures 
(Topic 280) (ASU No. 2023-07), which requires improved reportable segment disclosures, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The new standard was effective for our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2024, and interim periods beginning on January 1, 2025. We applied the new guidance retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The standard did not impact our consolidated operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. See Note 6 for our segment disclosures.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
Income Taxes
: In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09: 
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740) 
(ASU No. 2023-09), which requires additional disclosures primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. This standard is effective for our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2025. Entities should apply the guidance prospectively. We are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2023-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Income Statement
: In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03: 
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses (DISE) 
(ASU No. 2024-03), which requires additional disclosure of the nature of expenses included in the income statement. The standard requires disclosures about specific types of expenses included in the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement as well as disclosures about selling expenses. This standard is effective for our fiscal year beginning on January 1, 2027 and interim periods beginning on January 1, 2028. Early adoption is permitted. Entities should apply the guidance prospectively although retrospective application is permitted. We have not made a decision on early adoption and are evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2024-03 will have on our disclosures.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
Not applicable.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
(a)  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
We completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2024. Management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, participated in and supervised this e
valuation. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act meets the requirements listed above.
Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this Report) fairly present, in all material respects, the company’s financial position and results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented, in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles.
(b)  Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined under Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). 
We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and under the oversight of our board of directors, of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
KPMG LLP, the company’s independent registered public accounting firm, who audited our consolidated financial statements included in this Report, issued its report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this report under the caption “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”.
(c)  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
