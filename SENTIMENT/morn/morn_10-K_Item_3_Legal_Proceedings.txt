Part II
Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "MORN."
As of February 21, 2025, there were 527 shareholders of record of our common stock. The actual number of stockholders is greater than this number of record holders and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners but whose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees.
We paid four quarterly dividends during 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we announced an increase of our quarterly cash dividend from 40.5 cents per share to 45.5 cents per share. While subsequent dividends will be subject to board approval, we expect to pay a regular quarterly dividend of 45.5 cents per share in 2025. 
Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law, and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors. Future indebtedness and loan facilities could also prohibit or restrict our ability to pay dividends and make distributions to our shareholders.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Subject to applicable law, we may repurchase shares at prevailing market prices directly on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in amounts that we deem appropriate.
The table below presents information related to repurchases of common stock we made during the three months ended December 31, 2024. Refer to Note 18 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our share repurchase program:

Understanding Our Company 
Key Business Characteristics
Our mission is to empower investor success. The investing ecosystem is complex, and navigating it with confidence requires a trusted, independent voice. We deliver our perspective to institutions, advisors, and individuals with a single-minded purpose: to empower every investor with conviction that they can make better-informed decisions and realize success on their own terms. 
Our strategy is to deliver insights and experiences that make us essential to investor workflow. Proprietary data sets, meaningful analytics, independent research, and effe
ctive investment strategies are at the core of the powerful digital solutions that investors across our client segments rely on. We have a keen focus on innovation across data, research, product, and delivery so that we can effectively cater to the evolving needs and expectations of investors globally. 
Segments

The company 
has seven operating segments which are presented as the following five reportable segments: Morningstar Data and Analytics, PitchBook, Morningstar Wealth, Morningstar Credit, and Morningstar Retirement. The operating segments of Morningstar Sustainalytics and Morningstar Indexes do not individually meet the quantitative segment reporting thresholds and have been combined and presented as part of Corporate and All Other, which is not a reportable segment. Prior-period segment information is presented on a comparable basis to the basis on which current period segment information is presented and reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM). For additional information about our segment reporting, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II of this Report. 
Revenue
We offer an extensive line of investment-related products and services for individual and institutional investors in public and private capital markets; financial advisors and wealth managers; alliances and redistributors; asset managers; retirement plan providers, advisors and sponsors; and issuers of fixed-income securities.

Table of Contents

Our segments sell many of our research and data products and services through license agreements on either a per user or enterprise-basis. Morningstar Data and Analytics and PitchBook generate most of our license-based revenue. Our license agreements typically range from one to three years and are accounted for as subscription services available to customers and not as licenses under the accounting guidance.
Our Morningstar Wealth and Morningstar Retirement segments generate most of our asset-based revenue where basis points and other fees are charged for assets under management or advisement (AUMA). Our asset-based arrangements typically range from one to three years. 
Our transaction-based revenue includes revenue that is one time in nature and related Morningstar Credit recurring revenue primarily derived from surveillance and research.
Deferred Revenue
We invoice some of our clients and collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscription services to our customers. Deferred revenue totaled $563.2 million, of which $540.8 million was classified as a current liability with an additional $22.4 million included in long-term liabilities, at the end of 2024. We expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill the service obligations under our license and subscription agreements.
Operating Expense
We classify our operating expense into separate categories for cost of revenue, sales and marketing, general and administrative, and depreciation and amortization, as described below. 
• 
Cost of revenue. 
This category includes compensation expense for employees who produce the products and services we deliver to our customers. For example, this category covers production teams and analysts who write investment research reports. It also includes compensation expense for programmers, designers, and other employees who develop new products and enhance existing products. In some cases, we capitalize the compensation costs associated with certain software development projects resulting in reduced expense that we would otherwise report in this category. Cost of revenue also includes other expenses, such as third-party data purchases and data lines as well as professional fees for third-party development activities. 
• 
Sales and marketing. 
This category includes compensation expense for our sales teams, product managers, and marketing professionals. We also include the cost of advertising, digital marketing campaigns, and other marketing and promotion efforts in this category.
• 
General and administrative. 
This category includes compensation expense for our management team and other corporate functions, including employees in our compliance, finance, human resources, and legal departments. It also includes costs for corporate systems and facilities. 
• 
Depreciation and amortization. 
Our capital expenditures mainly relate to capitalized software development costs, information technology equipment, and leasehold improvements. We amortize capitalized software development costs over their estimated economic life, generally three years. We depreciate property and equipment using the straight-line method based on the useful lives of the assets, which range from three to seven years. We amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives, whichever is shorter. We also include amortization related to identifiable intangible assets, which is mainly driven by acquisitions, in this category. We amortize intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated economic useful lives, which range from one to twenty years.
International Operations
As of December 31, 2024, we had wholly-owned subsidiaries in 31 countries outside of the US and included their results of operations and financial condition in our consolidated financial statements. We also have investments outside of the US, and where we have significant influence, we apply the equity method of accounting.

How We Evaluate Our Business
When our analysts evaluate a stock, they focus on assessing the company's estimated intrinsic value, which is based on estimated future cash flows, discounted to their value in today's dollars. Our approach to evaluating our own business works the same way.
Our goal is to increase the intrinsic value of our business over time, which we believe is the best way to create value for our shareholders. We do not make public financial forecasts for our business because we want to avoid creating any incentives for our management team to make speculative statements about our financial results that could influence our stock price or take actions that help us meet short-term forecasts, but may not build long-term shareholder value.
We pro
vide the following
 measures that can help investors generate their own assessment of how our intrinsic value has changed over time: 
    •    Revenue (including organic revenue);
    •    Operating income (including adjusted operating income);
    •    Operating margin (including adjusted operating margin); and
    •    Free cash flow.
Organic revenue, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, and free cash flow are not measures of performance set forth under US generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 
We define organic revenue as consolidated revenue excluding acquisitions, divestitures, adoption of new accounting standard changes (accounting changes), and foreign currency translations. We present organic revenue because we believe it helps investors better compare our period-to-period results, and our management team uses this measure to evaluate the performance of our business and product areas. We exclude revenue from businesses acquired or divested from organic revenue for a period of 12 months after we complete the acquisition or divestiture. Organic revenue is not equivalent to any measure required under GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
We define adjusted operating income as operating income excluding all mergers and acquisitions (M&A)-related expenses and gains (related to merger, acquisition, and divestiture activity including earn-outs), intangible amortization, and expenses related to the significant reduction and shift of the company's operations in China. We define adjusted operating margin as operating margin excluding all M&A-related expenses and gains, intangible amortization, and expenses related to the significant reduction and shift of the company's operations in China. We present these measures because we believe they better reflect period-over-period comparisons and improves overall understanding of the underlying performance of the business absent the impact of M&A and the shift of the company's operations in China.
We define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to help investors better understand how much cash is available after making capital expenditures. Our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate the health of our business. Free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure required under GAAP and should not be considered an indicator of liquidity. Moreover, the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
In addition to the measures described above, we calculate revenue renewal rates to evaluate how successful we've been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have revenue associated with periodic renewals. We use the annual contract value method, which tracks the dollar value of renewals compared with the total dollar value of contracts up for renewal during the period. We include changes in the contract value in the renewal amount. We use the actual revenue for the previous comparable fiscal period as the base rate for calculating the renewal percentage. The renewal rate excludes setup and customization fees and contract renewals that were pending as of January 31, 2025.
