Item 2. Properties
As of December 31, 2024, we leased approximately 527,000 square feet of office space for our US operations, with approximately half of the space for our corporate headquarters located in Chicago, Illinois. We also lease approximately 727,000 square feet of office space in 22 other countries around the world, including approximately 360,000 square feet in Mumbai, India and approximately 95,000 
square feet in Toronto, Canada. We believe that our existing and planned office facilities, which are used by all of our segments, are adequate for our needs and that additional or substitute sp
ace is available to accommodate growth and expansion.
