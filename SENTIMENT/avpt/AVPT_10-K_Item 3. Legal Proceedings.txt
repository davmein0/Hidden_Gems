PART II

Item 7

Organizations today face a host of challenges that make a robust data management strategy indispensable, including:

■

Optimizing data for AI
: As organizations modernize their data ecosystems, the complexities of leveraging generative artificial intelligence (“AI”) technologies require proper governance, security, and lifecycle management. With AvePoint, companies can extract more value from complex datasets, make informed decisions, reduce workloads, and enhance customer experiences.

■

Explosive data growth
: The hybrid work model and software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) proliferation have led to a surge in unstructured, sensitive data. AvePoint’s solutions tackle the sprawl with robust control and protection measures to manage this growth.

■

A dangerous threat landscape and complex regulations
: Companies are navigating increasing cyber threats and global regulatory demands. AvePoint ensures data is protected, secure, and compliant, helping mitigate financial, operational, and reputational risks.

■

The need for automation
: To monitor, govern, and respond to threats efficiently, organizations require streamlined, automated platforms that deliver rapid value. AvePoint’s automation layer integrates seamlessly to achieve this efficiency.

Guided by its 
Beyond Secure 
philosophy, AvePoint goes beyond traditional boundaries to inspire trust, enabling organizations to focus on innovation while protecting against data breaches and unauthorized access. For over 20 years, AvePoint has continually innovated to provide solutions that meet the demands of modern data management, empowering businesses to overcome challenges and unlock new possibilities in an ever-evolving landscape.

Key Business Metric

Our management reviews the following key business metric to measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, make strategic decisions, and effectively allocate resources. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to this metric to evaluate progress against our growth strategies and gain additional transparency into performance trends.

Annual Recurring Revenue

December 31,

2024

2023

Total ARR ($ in mil)

$

327.0

$

264.5

We believe ARR further enables measurement of our business performance, is an important metric for financial forecasting, and better enables us to make strategic business decisions. We calculate ARR as the annualized sum of contractually obligated Annual Contract Value (“
ACV
”) from SaaS, term license and support, and maintenance revenue sources from all active customers at the end of a reporting period.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, total ARR was $327.0 million and $264.5 million, respectively, representing growth of 24%. Adjusted for FX, total ARR increased 25% year-over-year.

Growth in ARR is driven by both new customer acquisition and the expansion of existing customer relationships. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or replace these items. ARR is not a forecast of future revenue, and the active contracts used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.

Components of Results of Operations

Revenue

We generate revenue from four primary sources: SaaS, term license and support, services, and maintenance. We consider SaaS, term license and support, and maintenance revenues to be recurring.

SaaS revenues are generated from our cloud-based solutions. Term license and support revenues are generated from the sales of on-premise or hybrid licenses which include a distinct support component. Both SaaS and term license and support revenues are primarily billed annually. SaaS and term license and support are generally sold per user license or based upon the amount of data protected. SaaS revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract. For term license and support revenue, the license component is generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use, and the support component is recognized ratably over the term of the contract.

Services revenue includes revenue generated from implementation, training, consulting, license customization and managed services. These revenues are recognized by applying a measure of progress, such as labor hours, to determine the percentage of completion of each contract. These offerings are not inherently recurring in nature and as such are subject to more period-to-period volatility than other elements of our business. Services revenue from managed services are recognized ratably or on a straight-line basis over the contract term.

Maintenance revenue is a result of selling on-going support for legacy perpetual licenses. It also includes recurring professional services such as technical account management. Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement, which is typically one year.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of SaaS and cost of term license and support consists of all direct costs to deliver and support our SaaS and term license and support products, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and related expenses, overhead, third-party hosting fees related to our cloud services, and depreciation and amortization. We recognize these expenses as they are incurred. We expect that these costs will increase in absolute dollars but may fluctuate as a percentage of SaaS and term license and support revenue from period to period.

Cost of maintenance consists of all direct costs to support our legacy perpetual license products, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and related expenses, overhead, and depreciation and amortization. We recognize these expenses as they are incurred. We expect that cost of maintenance revenue will decrease in absolute dollars as maintenance revenue declines but may fluctuate as a percentage of maintenance revenue.

Cost of services consists of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and related expenses for our services organization, overhead, technology necessary to service our customers, and depreciation and amortization. We recognize these expenses as they are incurred.

      41

Table of Contents

PART II

Item 7

Gross Profit and Gross Margin

Gross profit is revenue less cost of revenue, and gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of revenue.

Gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by various factors, including the mix of our revenue, the costs associated with third-party cloud-based hosting services for our cloud-based subscriptions, and the extent to which we expand our customer support and services organizations. We expect that our gross margin will fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these various factors.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for sales, marketing and customer success personnel, stock-based compensation expense, sales commissions, marketing programs, travel-related expenses, overhead costs, depreciation and amortization. We focus our sales and marketing efforts on creating sales leads and establishing and promoting our brand. Incremental sales commissions for new customer contracts are deferred and amortized ratably over the estimated period of our relationship with such customers. We plan to continue our investment in sales and marketing by hiring additional sales and marketing personnel, executing our go-to-market strategy globally, and building our brand awareness.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses for finance, legal and compliance, human resources, and IT personnel, as well as stock-based compensation expense, external professional services, overhead costs, other administrative functions, depreciation and amortization. Our general and administrative expenses have increased as a result of operating as a public company, including costs to comply with the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, costs related to compliance and reporting obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, and increased expenses for insurance, investor relations, and professional services.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses incurred for our engineering and product and design teams, as well as stock-based compensation expense, overhead costs, depreciation and amortization. We have a geographically dispersed research and development presence in the United States, China, Singapore and Vietnam. We believe this provides a strategic advantage, allowing us to invest efficiently in both new product development and increasing our existing product capabilities. We believe delivering expanding product functionality is critical to enhancing the success of existing customers while new product development further reinforces our breadth of software solutions.

Other (Expense) Income, net

Other (expense) income, net consists primarily of fair value adjustments on earn-out and warrant liabilities, realized gain/loss for securities, and of foreign currency remeasurement gains/losses.

Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions. The foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have different statutory tax rates than those of the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rate could be affected by the relative proportion of foreign to domestic income, use of foreign tax credits, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, applicability of any valuation allowances, and changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate.

 million, and represented 70% of total revenue, up from 59% of total revenue in the prior year. The increase in SaaS revenue, which was driven by strong customer demand for our SaaS solutions, was partially offset by an expected decrease in both term license and support and maintenance revenue.

   Services revenue is expected to fluctuate as the services generally are not recurring in nature. Additionally, maintenance revenue is expected to continue declining as we have shifted away from the sale of perpetual licenses and towards SaaS and term licenses. Without perpetual license sales, there will be limited opportunities to sell maintenance contracts to new customers. Existing customers have and will continue to transition to SaaS and term licenses, which will further support the continued decline in maintenance revenue.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In addition to our financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, we disclose non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP sales and marketing expense, non-GAAP general and administrative expense, non-GAAP research and development expense, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin.

We believe these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into our operational performance and into trends affecting our business. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to understand and compare operating results across accounting periods, for internal budgeting and forecasting purposes, and to evaluate financial performance.

Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to operating income, operating margin or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as measures of performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.

Non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin are non-GAAP financial measures that our management uses to assess our overall performance. We define non-GAAP operating income as GAAP operating income plus stock-based compensation and the amortization of acquired intangible assets. We define non-GAAP operating margin as non-GAAP operating income divided by revenue. We believe non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin provide our management and investors consistency and comparability with our past financial performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons of operations, as these metrics eliminate the effects of stock-based compensation, which has had historical volatility from period to period due to mark-to-market securities, and of acquired intangible assets, which are unrelated to current operations and are neither comparable to the prior period nor predictive of future results. The elimination of the effect of variability caused by stock-based compensation expense and the amortization of acquired intangible assets, both of which are non-cash expenses, provides a better representation as to the overall operating performance of the company. We use non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance and trends as well as our performance relative to our peers, (b) to set and approve spending budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, and (e) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures.

GAAP operating margin for the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
 was 
2.2%
 and 
(5.6)%
, respectively. Non-GAAP operating margin for the years ended 
December 31, 2024 and 2023
 was 14.4% and 
8.1%
, respectively. The increase in non-GAAP operating margin was primarily attributable to the Company
’s
 enhanced focus on expense management and continued scaling of the Company
’s
 channel partner strategy.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of 
December 31, 2024
, we had 
$290.7
 million in cash and cash equivalents, 
$0.2
 million in short-term investments and no outstanding debt.

Our short-term liquidity needs primarily include working capital for sales and marketing, research and development, and continued innovation. 
In addition, we extended a credit facility with a remaining commitment of $1.5 million, and committed $50.0 million to a growth equity fund. We also have letters of credit issued in the amount of $1.0 million as security for operating leases, and $4.4 million as security for customer contingency agreements. 
Our long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, levels of revenue, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, market acceptance of our platform, the results of business initiatives, and the timing of new product introductions. Refer to “
Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies
” for more information regarding the purchase commitments.

We also maintain a loan and security agreement (the “
Loan Agreement
”), dated November 3, 2023, with HSBC Bank USA, National Association (“
HSBC
”), as lender, for a revolving line of credit of up to $30.0 million with an accordion feature that provides up to $20.0 million of additional borrowing capacity we may draw upon at our request. The line bears interest at a rate equal to term SOFR plus 3.0% to 3.3% depending on the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Loan Agreement). The line carries an unused fee equal to 0.5%. The line will mature on November 3, 2026. We are required to maintain a minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Loan Agreement) as well as a maximum Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, tested by HSBC each quarter. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, we pledged, assigned and granted HSBC a security interest in all shares of our subsidiaries, future proceeds, and assets as security for our obligations under the Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2024, we are compliant with all covenants and had no borrowings outstanding under the Loan Agreement.

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, our cash flows from operating activities, and our borrowing capacity under our Loan Agreement will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs and debt service obligations for at least the next twelve months. In the future, we may attempt to raise additional capital through equity or debt financing. The sale of additional equity would be dilutive to our stockholders. Additional debt financing could result in increased debt service obligations and more restrictive financial and operational covenants.

The main considerations of changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in cash inflows related to an increase in deferred revenue that is partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable as a result of business growth. This was partially offset by cash outflows related to an increase in deferred contract costs and operating lease liabilities.

Indebtedness

Credit Facility

We maintain a line of credit under the Loan Agreement with HSBC, as lender. See “
Note 9 
–
 Line of Credit
” in Part II, Item 8 “
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
” of this Annual Report.

The Loan Agreement provides for a revolving line of credit of up to $30.0 million, with an additional $20.0 million accordion feature for additional capital we may draw upon at our request. Borrowings under the line bear interest at a rate equal to term SOFR plus 3.0% to 3.3% depending on the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio. The line carries an unused fee at a rate equal to 0.5%. Any proceeds of borrowings under the Loan Agreement will be used for general corporate purposes.

On a consolidated basis with our subsidiaries, we are required to maintain a minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio as well as a maximum Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio, tested by HSBC each quarter. Pursuant to the Loan Agreement, we pledged, assigned, and granted HSBC a security interest in all shares of our subsidiaries, future proceeds, and certain assets as security for our obligations under the Loan Agreement. Our line of credit under the Loan Agreement will mature on November 3, 2026.

To date, we are in compliance with all covenants under the Loan Agreement. We have not at any time, including as of and for the fiscal year ending as of December 31, 2024, borrowed under the Loan Agreement. The description of the Loan Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of such agreement, a copy of which is attached as an exhibit to this Annual Report.

Leasing Obligations

We are obligated under various non-cancelable operating leases for office space. The initial terms of the leases expire on various dates through 2030. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, total rent expense for facilities amounted to $7.2 million and $6.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, letters of credit have been issued in the amount of $1.0 million as security for operating leases. The letters of credit are secured by certificates of deposit and a line of credit.

Operating Segment Information

We operate in one segment. Our products and services are sold throughout the world, through direct and indirect sales channels. Our chief operating decision maker (the “
CODM
”) is our Chief Executive Officer. The CODM makes operating performance assessment and resource allocation decisions on a global basis. The CODM does not receive discrete financial information about asset allocation, expense allocation, or profitability by product or geography. See “
Note 18 
–
 Segment Information
” (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report) for more information.

Critical Accounting Estimates

Preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We also make estimates and assumptions on the reported revenue generated and reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the section titled “
Note - 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
” (Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report), we believe the following critical accounting policies are most important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results.

      50

Table of Contents

PART II

Item 7

Revenue Recognition

We derive revenue from four primary sources: SaaS, term license and support, services, and maintenance. Many of our contracts with customers include multiple performance obligations. Our products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency; therefore, our products and services are generally not combined. We allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price (“
SSP
”) for each performance obligation within each contract.

We use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except term licenses, we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. Term licenses are sold only as a bundled arrangement that includes the rights to a term license and support. In determining the SSP of license and support in a term license arrangement, we utilize observable inputs and consider the value relationship between support and term license when compared to the value relationship between support and perpetual licenses, the average economic life of our products, and software renewals rates. Using a combination of the relative fair value method or the residual value method, the SSP of the performance obligations in an arrangement is allocated to each performance obligation within a sales arrangement.

Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks

The markets for software and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. Customer preferences evolve rapidly, and choices in hardware, products, and devices can and do influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt to keep pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure, research and development, marketing, and geographic expansion will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.

Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits.

Additionally, demand for our software and service is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic and currently include multiple ongoing conflicts where the outcomes and consequences are not possible to predict, but could include regional instability and geopolitical shifts, and could materially adversely affect global trade, currency exchange rates, regional economies and the global economy. These in turn could increase our costs, disrupt our supply chain, reduce our sales and earnings, impair our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Item 7

Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses. Many of these revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Refer to the section titled “
Risk Factors
” (Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.

Seasonality

Our quarterly revenue can fluctuate and does not necessarily grow sequentially when measuring any one fiscal quarter’s revenue against another. Historically, our first quarter has been our lowest revenue quarter and our fourth quarter has been our highest revenue quarter, however those results are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly revenue or full year results. Additionally, the timing of new product and service introductions can significantly impact revenue. Lastly, the mix of revenues in any given quarter can cause fluctuations in our reported results, due to differing revenue recognition principles.

ITEM 7A. 
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks 

Interest Rate Risk 

We had cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and short-term deposits of $290.9 million as of December 31, 2024, which we hold for working capital purposes. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in cash deposits and money market funds. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, we do not believe that we have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio due to changes in interest rates. Declines in interest rates, however, would reduce our future interest income. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have a material negative impact on our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2024, we had no outstanding obligations under our line of credit with HSBC under the Loan Agreement. To the extent we enter into other long-term debt arrangements in the future, we would be subject to fluctuations in interest rates which could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operation.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 

Fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into U.S. Dollars. In particular, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities that we report in U.S. Dollars for a significant portion of the cash held by these subsidiaries is subject to translation variance caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as of the end of each respective reporting period, the offset to which is substantially recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets and is also presented as a line item in its consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.

If overall foreign currency exchange rates in comparison to the U.S. Dollar uniformly would have been weaker by 10% as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities AvePoint would have reported in U.S. Dollars would have decreased by approximately $4.8 million and $3.4 million, respectively, assuming constant foreign currency cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.

We believe we are in large part naturally hedged against foreign currency exchange risk from our ongoing business operations, as most of our regional revenues are generated in the same currency as that region’s expenses are paid.

Concentration of Credit Risk 

We deposit our cash with financial institutions, and, at times, such balances may exceed federally insured limits.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of AvePoint, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AvePoint, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, mezzanine equity and stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control 
—
 Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Revenue Recognition 
–
 Determination of Standalone Selling Prices 
—
 Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company’s revenue is derived from four primary sources: SaaS, term license and support, services, and maintenance. Many of the Company’s contractual arrangements with customers include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the aggregate transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price (“SSP”) for each performance obligation. The Company applies judgment in determining SSP for each performance obligation.

Term licenses are sold only as a bundled arrangement that includes the rights to a term license and support. In determining the SSP of license and support in a term license arrangement, management utilizes observable inputs and considers the value relationship between support and term license when compared to the value relationship between support and perpetual licenses, the average economic life of their products, and software renewal rates.

For substantially all of the Company’s other contractual arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the Company determines SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. The Company typically establishes an SSP range for its products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. We identified the determination of SSP for products and services as a critical audit matter due to the judgement by management involved in the determination of SSP, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing audit procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s determination of SSP.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the Company’s SSP determinations included the following, among others:

•

We tested the effectiveness of controls over revenue recognition, which included controls associated with the Company’s methodology to determine SSP and the underlying data utilized in the application of the methodology.

•

We evaluated the appropriateness of the Company’s methodology to determine SSP in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

•

We tested the accuracy of inputs utilized by the Company to determine SSP, which included selecting a sample of the Company’s transactional data used to determine SSP and agreeing relevant information to source documents.

•

We tested the completeness of the Company’s transactional data used to determine SSP by selecting a sample of previously recorded sales and agreeing relevant information into such transactional data.

•

We tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculations to determine SSP.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1.
 Nature of Business and Organization 

AvePoint, Inc., incorporated as a New Jersey corporation on 
 July 24, 2001 (“
Legacy AvePoint
”), was redomiciled as a Delaware corporation in 
2006,
 and changed its name to “AvePoint Operations, Inc.” in 
 June 2021. 
On 
 July 1, 2021, 
Legacy AvePoint and certain members of Apex Technology Acquisition Corporation (“
Apex
”) consummated the transactions contemplated by a business combination agreement (the “
Apex Business Combination
”) and a number of qualified institutional buyers and accredited investors consummated their respective purchases of shares as contemplated by related subscription agreements, with Apex being renamed “AvePoint, Inc.” On 
 July 2, 2021, 
shares of common stock were officially listed under the ticker “AVPT” on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Subsequent to the consummation of the Apex Business Combination, on 
 July 26, 2021, 
Legacy AvePoint’s successor by merger AvePoint US LLC merged with and into AvePoint, Inc. with AvePoint, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as “
AvePoint
”, the “
Company
”, “
we
”, “
us
”, or “
our
”) surviving.

Our principal executive headquarters is located in Jersey City, New Jersey, and our principal operating headquarters is located in Richmond, Virginia. We have additional offices across North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and the Middle East.

AvePoint generates revenue by providing customers a cloud-native data management software platform, enabling them to prepare, secure, and optimize their critical data. The AvePoint Confidence Platform unifies data security, governance, and business continuity into a seamless, resilient experience, addressing the most pressing challenges in today’s complex digital landscape.

2.
 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation 

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and include the consolidated accounts of AvePoint, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance

In the year ended 
 December 31, 2024, 
the Company adopted the accounting standards update that requires companies to provide disclosures of significant segment expenses and other segment items (refer to “
Note 
18

–
 Segment Information
”). Disclosures about a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually will also have to be provided in interim periods. In addition, companies with a single reportable segment are required to provide all the disclosures required by Segment Reporting (ASC 
280
)
.

Business Combination

When we consummate a business combination, the assets acquired, and the liabilities assumed are recognized separately from goodwill at their acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the acquisition date fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. While best estimates and assumptions are used to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which 
 may 
be up to 
one
 year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill as we obtain new information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. Upon the earlier of the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Acquisition-related costs were immaterial and were expensed as incurred.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. The amounts of assets and liabilities reported in our consolidated balance sheets and the amounts of revenue and expenses reported for each of its periods presented are affected by estimates and assumptions, which are used for, but 
not
 limited to, the accounting for determination of standalone selling price for revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, deferred contract costs, valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, income taxes and related reserves, stock-based compensation, purchase price in a business combination, and earn-out liabilities. Actual results and outcomes 
 may 
differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.

Foreign Currency 

The Company has foreign operations where the functional currency has been determined to be the local currency. Adjustments resulting from translating such foreign functional currency assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars, based on current exchange rates, are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the Company
’s
 consolidated balance sheets. Revenue and expenses are translated using average rates prevailing during the period. Transaction gains and losses arising from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in other (expense) income, net in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The Company maintains cash with several high credit-quality financial institutions. The Company considers all investments available with original maturities of 
three
 months or less to be cash equivalents. These investments are 
not
 subject to significant market risk. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in bank accounts which, at times, exceed the federally insured limits. The Company has 
not
 experienced any losses in such accounts. The Company maintains cash balances used in operations at entities based in countries which impose regulations that limit the ability to transfer cash out of the country. As of 
 December 31, 2024 
and 
2023
, the Company’s cash balances at these entities were 
$
15.5
 million and 
$
13.1
 million, respectively.

Based on our intentions regarding our investments in U.S. treasury bills, we classify these investments as available-for-sale. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders’ equity, except for the interest income from amortization of the discount arising at acquisition, and any unrealized losses determined to be related to credit losses, which we record within other (expense) income, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Short-Term Investments

Short-term investments consist mainly of certificates of deposit held by financial institutions which have an initial maturity of greater than 
three
 months but less than or equal to 
one
 year at period end.

Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets

The prepaid expenses balances as of 
 December 31, 2024 
and 
2023
 were 
$
7.2
 million and 
$
7.6
 million, respectively.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or related contract terms beginning in the year the asset was placed into service.

We depreciate computer equipment and software generally over a period of 
three
 years. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate furniture and fixture generally over a period of 
seven
 years. We depreciate buildings over a period of 
forty
 years. We depreciate office equipment generally over a period of 
five
 years. Depreciation and amortization for buildings, information technology assets, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures commences once they are ready for our intended use.

Normal repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. We write off depreciated assets that are 
no
 longer in service.

We evaluate long-lived assets, which include leasehold improvements and equipment subject to depreciation and amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset 
 may 
not
 be recoverable. An impairment loss will be recognized when the aggregate of estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposition of the long-lived assets less than its carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is determined based on the fair value of the long-lived asset.

There were 
no
 impairment charges recognized during the years ended 
 December 31, 2024
, 
2023
 and 
2022,
 respectively.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired. 

We review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill 
 may 
not
 be recoverable. We have elected to 
first
 assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than 
not
 that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we determine that it is more likely than 
not
 that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed. The quantitative goodwill impairment test identifies goodwill impairment and measures the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized by comparing the fair value of our single reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value exceeds its carrying amount, 
no
 further analysis is required; otherwise, any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value.

Intangible Assets, net

Intangible assets primarily consist of customer related assets and acquired software and technology. Typical customer related assets include order backlogs and customer relationships. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives on a straight-line basis, which range from 
three
 years to 
ten
 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by considering events or circumstances that 
 may 
warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset 
 may 
be impaired.

Leases

Leases are classified as either operating or finance leases based on certain criteria. This classification determines the timing and presentation of expenses on the income statement, as well as the presentation of the related cash flows and balance sheet. The Company currently has 
no
 material finance leases.

Right-of-use (“
ROU
”) assets and related liabilities are recorded at lease commencement based on the present value of the lease payments over the expected lease term. Lease payments include future increases unless the increases are based on changes in an index or rate. If the rate implicit in the leases was 
not
 readily determinable, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate is used to calculate ROU assets and related liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on the Company’s estimated credit rating, the term of the lease, the economic environment where the asset resides and full collateralization. Lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is allocated within operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. We elected to combine fixed payments for non-lease components, for all classes of underlying assets, with our lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.

Deferred Contract Costs 

We defer sales commissions that are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining or renewing SaaS, term license and support, service, perpetual license and maintenance contracts. The initial commissions are amortized over the anticipated period of asset benefit. We have structured commissions plans such that the commission rate paid on renewal contracts are less than those paid on the initial contract; therefore, it is determined that the renewal commissions are 
not
 commensurate with the initial commission, which are related to future contracts with a customer. The renewal commissions are amortized over the average renewal term. We determine the anticipated period of asset benefit and the average renewal term utilizing a portfolio approach, considering our customer contracts, the duration of our relationships with our customers, and the useful life of our technology. Changes in the anticipated period of asset benefit or the average renewal term are recognized on a prospective basis upon occurrence. 
No
 impairment was recorded for the years ended 
 December 31, 2024
, 
2023
 and 
2022.

Amortization of deferred contract costs of $
20.9
 million, $
19.0
 million and $
13.4
 million for the years ended 
 December 31, 2024
, 
2023
 and 
2022,
 respectively, is included as a component of sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations.

Software Development Costs

Costs are incurred in the development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products. These costs, consisting primarily of salaries and related payroll costs, are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established. After technological feasibility is established, costs are capitalized. 

Costs to develop or obtain internal-use software and implementation costs incurred in hosting arrangements and costs of significant upgrades and enhancements resulting in additional functionality are capitalized in the intangible assets, net within the consolidated balance sheets. These costs are primarily software purchased for internal use, purchased software licenses, implementation costs, and development costs related to our hosted product, which is accessed by customers on a subscription basis. Costs incurred for maintenance, training, and minor modifications or enhancements are expensed as incurred. The capitalized expenses are amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is generally 
three
 years. Management evaluates the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. Internally developed software costs required to be capitalized as defined by the accounting guidance are 
not
 material to our consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition 

We derive revenue from 
four
 primary sources: SaaS, term license and support, services, and maintenance.

Our sources of revenue mainly include:

■

SaaS and term license and support revenue includes revenue from the sale of SaaS and term license and support, product offerings of our software and related customer support. SaaS revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract. Term license revenue includes distinct on-premises license and support performance obligations. The license is generally recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use, and the support is recognized ratably over the term of the contract.

■
Services revenue includes revenue derived primarily from the implementation of software, training, consulting, and migrations. We also offer license customization and managed services. Services revenue from implementation, training, consulting, migration, and license customization is recognized by applying a measure of progress, such as labor hours to determine the percentage of completion of each contract. Services revenue from managed services is recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the contract term.

■
Maintenance revenue includes revenue from sales of perpetual license and related post-contract support. Perpetual license revenue is recognized upfront upon delivery of the licensed product and/or the utility that enables the customer to access authorization keys, provided that an enforceable contract has been received. While perpetual license revenues today are immaterial, our perpetual licenses are typically sold with post-contract support (“
PCS
”), which includes unspecified technical enhancements and customer support. Revenue from PCS is classified as maintenance revenue and is recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is typically 
one
 year, as we satisfy the PCS performance obligation.

In rare cases when the software and the related when-and-if available updates are critical to the combined utility of the software, the Company has determined this to be 
one
 performance obligation and revenue is recognized ratably over the license term. 

Term license and perpetual license revenue recognized at point in time was $
27.3
 million, $
31.4
 million and $
40.0
 million for the years ended 
 December 31, 2024
, 
2023
 and 
2022,
 respectively. The remaining revenue amount is recognized over time.

Our revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control of promised goods or services provided to its customers, reflecting the amount of consideration it expects to receive for those goods or services. Revenue is recognized upon the application of the following steps:

■

identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;

■
identification of the performance obligations in the contract;

■
determination of the transaction price;

■
allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and

■
recognition of revenue when, or as, the contractual performance obligations are satisfied.

Our revenue arrangements generally include standard warranty or service level provisions that its arrangements will perform and operate in all material respects as defined in the respective agreements, the financial impacts of which have historically been and are expected to continue to be insignificant. Our arrangements generally do 
not
 include a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services. We recognize revenue net of any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

Many of our contracts include multiple performance obligations. Our products and services generally do 
not
 require a significant amount of integration or interdependency; therefore, the Company’s products and services are generally 
not
 combined. We allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price (“
SSP
”) for each performance obligation within each contract.

67

Table of Contents

AvePoint, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

We use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except term licenses, we are able to establish the SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. Term licenses are sold only as a bundled arrangement that includes the rights to a term license and support.

In determining the SSP of license and support in a term license arrangement we utilize observable inputs and consider the value relationship between support and term license when compared to the value relationship between support and perpetual licenses, the average economic life of our products and software renewal rates. Using a combination of the relative fair value method or the residual value method, the SSP of the performance obligations in an arrangement is allocated to each performance obligation within a sales arrangement.

We utilize indirect sales channels which leverage Channel Partners. These deals are executed in 
one
 of 
two
 ways:

1.

Channel Partner as Customer

In the 
first
 form of these arrangements, the Channel Partner purchases the products from us at a discounted price and resells the products to end users at a price determined by the Channel Partner. In this scenario, the Channel Partner is the entity that has contracted with us and therefore is determined to be our customer. We recognize revenue when control of the goods and/or services are transferred to the customer. In this 
first
 form of the sales transaction, revenue recognition occurs upon transfer to the Channel Partner (acting as reseller) or as directed by the Channel Partner (acting as reseller) to its customer.

2.

End User as Customer

In the 
second
 form, we bill the end user, and the Channel Partner receives a commission. Upon analysis of deals executed through the 
second
 form of these channels, we determined that the end user represents our customer due to the fact that the end user purchased goods and/or services that are outputs of our ordinary activities. Consequently, Channel Partners utilized in deals executed through this 
second
 model are deemed to be agents of the transaction. In this 
second
 form of these arrangements, we recognize revenue upon transfer of the goods and/or services to the end user, and amortize the commission over the anticipated period of asset benefit.

The timing of revenue recognition 
 may 
differ from the timing of invoicing to our customers. We record an unbilled receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing. Current unbilled receivables are included in accounts receivable, net in the consolidated balance sheets. Long-term unbilled receivables that are expected to be billed more than 
twelve
 months after the period end are included within other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. We record deferred revenue in the consolidated balance sheets when cash is collected or invoiced before revenue is earned. Our standard payment terms are generally net 
30
 days. Invoices for SaaS, term license and support and maintenance are generally issued annually in advance or when the license is made available for customer use. Invoices for license contracts are generally issued when the license is available for the customer for download. Services are generally invoiced in advance or as the services are performed.

Total deferred revenue as of 
 December 31, 2023
 was $
129.3
 million, of which $
113.5
 million was recognized as revenues for the year ended 
 December 31, 2024
.

318.5
 million is related to SaaS and term license and support revenue. We expect to recognize approximately 
62
% of the total transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations over the next 
twelve
 months and the remainder thereafter.

Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based compensation represents the cost related to stock-based awards granted to employees. To date, we have issued both stock options and restricted stock units. With respect to equity-classified awards, the Company measured stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognizes the cost as expense ratably over the requisite service period. With respect to liability-classified awards, the Company measures stock-based compensation cost at the grant date and at each reporting period based on the estimated fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation cost is recognized ratably over the requisite service period, net of actual forfeitures in the period.

We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The Black-Scholes model requires highly subjective assumptions in order to derive the inputs necessary to calculate the fair value of stock options. The Company calculates the expected term using the “simplified” method, which is the simple average of the vesting period and the contractual term. The simplified method is applied as the Company does 
not
 have sufficient historical data to provide a reasonable basis for an estimate of the expected term. Expected volatility is based on historical and implied volatility of a group of peer entities over a similar expected term. Dividend yields are based upon historical dividend yields. Risk-free interest rates are based on the implied yields currently available on U.S. Treasury 
zero
 coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term.

Income Taxes 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the difference between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes. Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognize tax benefits. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information. 

We recognized the tax expense related to Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“
GILTI
”) as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred.

Our valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization of tax attributes recorded in various jurisdictions. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than 
not
 that the deferred tax assets will 
not
 be realized. We have evaluated the realizability of our deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income, including the reversal of existing temporary differences, historical and projected operating results and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In assessing our valuation allowance as of 
 December 31, 2024, 
we considered all available evidence, including the magnitude of recent and current operating results, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our historical experience utilizing tax attributes prior to their expiration dates, the historical volatility of operating results of these jurisdictions and our assessment regarding the sustainability of their profitability. The weight we give to any particular item is, in part, dependent upon the degree to which it can be objectively verified. Valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets increased by a net $
3.3
 million.

Noncontrolling Interest

Noncontrolling Interest is recognized as equity in the Company's consolidated balance sheets, is reflected in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and is captured within the net (loss) income in the consolidated statements of mezzanine equity and stockholders’ equity. Noncontrolling interests represent ownership interests in the Company's subsidiaries held by 
third
 parties. Redeemable noncontrolling interest is measured at the higher of its redeemable value and net income (loss) allocated to the redeemable noncontrolling interest, and is included in mezzanine equity on the consolidated balance sheets. At each reporting period, we increase the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest by periodic accretions using the interest method so that the carrying amount will equal the redemption amount on the date that the put option becomes exercisable. These adjustments are recorded as net income attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statements of operations. Upon expiration of the underlying put option, the redeemable noncontrolling interest is reclassified to equity on the consolidated balance sheets.

Treasury Stock Retirement

We account for treasury stock transactions under the cost method. For each reacquisition of common stock, the number of shares and the acquisition price for those shares is added to the existing treasury stock count and total value, respectively. We periodically retire treasury shares that we acquire through share repurchases and return those shares to the status of authorized but unissued. When treasury shares are retired, we allocate the excess of the repurchase price over the par value of shares acquired between additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit. The portion allocated to additional paid-in capital is limited to the pro rata portion of additional paid-in capital for the retired treasury shares. Any further excess of the repurchase price is allocated to accumulated deficit.

 Business Combination

Apex Technology Acquisition Corporation

The Apex Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization as Legacy AvePoint was determined to be the accounting acquirer. This determination was primarily based on Legacy AvePoint comprising the ongoing operations of the combined entity, Legacy AvePoint’s senior management comprising the majority of the senior management of the combined company and the prior stockholders of Legacy AvePoint having a majority of the voting power of the combined entity. Operations and assets and liabilities of the Company prior to the Apex Business Combination in these financial statements are those of Legacy AvePoint. As a result, these financial statements represent the continuation of Legacy AvePoint and the historical stockholders’ deficiency. The accumulated deficit of Legacy AvePoint has been carried forward after the Apex Business Combination.

The following transactions occurred in connection with the Apex Business Combination which impacted our mezzanine equity and permanent equity accounts for the years ended

The Company’s effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to mix of pre-tax income (loss) results by jurisdictions taxed at different rates than 
21
%, a permanent item recorded for the executive compensation limitation, and changes in valuation allowance in certain foreign jurisdictions.

Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and (liabilities) are as follows:

As of 
 December 31, 2024
, the Company had net operating loss (“
NOL
”) carryforwards for state and local income tax of $
31.3
 million, which 
 may 
offset future taxable income. The state NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 
2026
. The Company also has foreign NOL carryforwards of approximately $
25.8
 million, which will expire beginning 
2029
 and NOL carryforward periods vary from 
5
 years to indefinite. 

75

Table of Contents

AvePoint, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, the U.S. NOL carryforwards are subjected to review and possible adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service and state tax authorities. NOL and tax credit carryforwards 
 may 
become subject to an annual limitation in the event of a 
50%
 cumulative change in the ownership interest of significant stockholders over a 
three
-year period in excess of 
50%,
 as defined under Sections 
382
 and 
383
 of the Internal Revenue Code, as well as similar state tax provisions. This could limit the amount of NOLs that the Company can utilize annually to offset future taxable income or tax liabilities. The amount of the annual limitation, if any, will be determined based on the value of the Company immediately prior to the ownership change. The Company 
 may 
have experienced an ownership change prior to 
 December 
31,

2024,
 however, the Company does 
not
 believe its NOL carryforwards would be limited under IRC Section 
382.
 The Company could experience an ownership change in the future which could limit the utilization of certain NOL carryforwards.

A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than 
not
 that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will 
not
 be realized. In making this assessment, management considered all available positive and negative evidence, including the level of historical taxable income, future reversals of existing temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and projected future taxable income. On the basis of this evaluation, a valuation allowance of $
25.8
 million and $
22.5
 million was recorded as of 
 December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
, respectively, against certain jurisdictions’ net deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than 
not
 that the tax benefit will 
not
 be realized.

As of 
 December 
31,

2024,
 the Company did 
not
 provide any foreign withholding taxes related to its foreign subsidiaries’ undistributed earnings, as such earnings have been retained and are intended to be indefinitely reinvested to fund ongoing operations of the foreign subsidiaries. It is 
not
 practicable to estimate the amount of taxes that would be payable upon remittance of these earnings, because such tax, if any, is dependent upon circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of the provision for income taxes. As of 
 December 31, 2024 
and 
2023
, the Company had $
0.2
 million and $
0.2
 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits. These amounts were included in other liabilities in their respective years. As of 
 December 31, 2024 
and 
2023
, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate was 
not
 material.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and foreign jurisdictions. The tax years 
2020
 through 
2023
 generally remain open for examination for federal, state and local tax purposes. The tax years 
2014
 through 
2023
 are open and subject to audit by foreign jurisdictions.

 Commitments and Contingencies 

Commitments 

The Company has outstanding unconditional purchase commitments to procure licenses to use IT software from suppliers. These agreements are negotiated in consideration of the volume of transactions with select suppliers and the associated required transaction volumes are expected to be met through the normal course of business.

In 
 December 2022, 
the Company signed an unconditional purchase commitment in the amount of $
96.0
 million to purchase IT solutions over a 
three
-year term. Under this agreement, payments are made upon access to the service. Any remaining obligations are due at the end of the 
three
-year term in 
 December 2025 
as specified in the agreement. Given the Company’s history of procuring similar products, it is expected that cash payments to the supplier will occur in 
2023
 through 
2025
 with any remaining amounts coming due in 
2025.
 During the years ended 
 December 31, 2024 
and 
2023,
 the Company paid $
28.3
 million and $
21.7
 million, respectively, related to the 
 December 2022 
agreement. 

In 
 December 2024, 
the Company signed an unconditional purchase commitment in the amount of $
15.0
 million to purchase additional IT solutions over a 
five
-year term. Under this agreement, payments are made upon access to the service. The agreement specified 
four
 minimum commitment periods. The minimum commitment payments are due at the end of each minimum commitment period.

In 
 February 2024, 
the Company has an outstanding commitment to contribute $
50.0
 million to the growth equity fund. Refer to “

Legal Proceedings

In the normal course of its business, the Company 
 may 
be involved in various claims, negotiations and legal actions. Except for such claims that arise in the normal course of business, as of 
 December 31, 2024
, the Company was 
not
 a party to any other litigation for which a material claim is reasonably possible, probable or estimable.

Indemnification

The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its executive officers and directors. These agreements, among other things, require AvePoint to indemnify its directors and executive officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, specifically the Delaware General Corporation Law (as the same exists or 
 may 
hereafter be amended) for certain expenses, including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines, and settlement amounts incurred by a director or officer in any action or proceeding arising out of their services as 
one
 of the Company’s directors or officers or any other company or enterprise to which the person provides services at the Company’s request.

As part of the business combination with Apex, we assumed certain indemnification obligations for Apex Technology Sponsor LLC and Jeff Epstein, Brad Koenig, David Chao, Peter Bell, Donna Wells, and Alex Vieux (the “
Indemnitees
” or “
Defendants
”). On 
 February 2, 2024, 
Drulias and Farzad (as purported Apex stockholders, the “
Plaintiffs
”) filed a class action complaint against the Indemnities in Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Dean William Drulias, et.al. v. Apex Technology Sponsor LLC, et.al., C.A. 
No.

2024
-
0094
-LWW. Plaintiffs asserted breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims against the Defendants. The complaint alleged that Defendants made false and misleading disclosures in the 
 June 2, 2021 
proxy statement of Apex impacting its stockholders’ vote to approve a merger between Apex and us and also affecting stockholders’ redemption rights prior to the merger. Plaintiffs sought unspecified damages, rescission or rescissory damages, and disgorgement of unjust enrichment. We were 
not
 a named defendant in the complaint but had indemnification obligations to the Defendants under indemnification agreements executed during the merger. Also, in accordance with the business combination agreement, the Defendants obtained insurance policies to cover post-closing liability, with Apex securing a policy with a limit of $
10
 million and the sponsors obtaining a policy with a $
3
 million limit. The parties participated in a mediation in 
 October 2024 
and agreed to settlement terms. Pursuant to a signed letter of intent and a forthcoming settlement agreement, releasing us and the Defendants and settling the class action, we will contribute $
1.4
 million toward the full settlement amount of $
14.4
 million. The remaining $
13
 million will be paid pursuant to the 
two
 aforementioned insurance policies covering the Defendants and sponsor. As of 
 December 31, 2024, 
an estimated accrual of $
1.4
 million was included in the accrued expenses and other current liabilities within the consolidated balance sheets.

Guarantees﻿

In the normal course of business, customers in certain geographies or in highly regulated sectors occasionally require contingency agreements, which are secured by certificates of deposit and a line of credit. The certificates of deposit are included in other assets within the consolidated balance sheets. As of 
 December 31, 2024
, letters of credit have been issued in the amount of $
4.4
 million, as security for the agreements. These agreements have 
not
 had a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flow.

 Company Earn-Out and Warrant Liabilities

Company Earn-Out

Certain holders of common stock and certain holders of options shall be issued additional shares of AvePoint’s common stock, as follows:

■
1,000,000
 shares of AvePoint’s common stock, in the aggregate, if at any time from 
 July 1, 2021 
through 
 July 1, 2028 (
a) AvePoint’s stock price is greater than or equal to 
$12.50
 over any 
20
 Trading Days within any 
30
 trading day period or (b) the Company consummates a subsequent transaction, which results in the stockholders of the Company having the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property having a value equaling or exceeding 
$12.50
 per share;

■
1,000,000
 shares of AvePoint’s common stock, in the aggregate, if at any time from 
 July 1, 2021 
through 
 July 1, 2028 (
a) AvePoint’s stock price is greater than or equal to 
$15.00
 over any 
20
 Trading Days within any 
30
 trading day period or (b) the Company consummates a subsequent transaction, which results in the stockholders of the Company having the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property having a value equaling or exceeding 
$15.00
 per share;

■
1,000,000
 shares of AvePoint’s common stock, in the aggregate, if at any time from 
 July 1, 2021 
through 
 July 1, 2028 (
a) AvePoint’s stock price is greater than or equal to 
$17.50
 over any 
20
 Trading Days within any 
30
 trading day period or (b) the Company consummates a subsequent transaction, which results in the stockholders of the Company having the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property having a value equaling or exceeding 
$17.50
 per share.

The rights described above are hereafter referred to as the “
Company Earn-Out Shares
”. To the extent that any portion of the Company Earn-Out Shares that would otherwise be issued to a holder of options that remain unvested at the date of the milestones described above, then in lieu of issuing the applicable Company Earn-Out Shares, the Company shall instead issue an award of restricted stock units of the Company for a number of shares of AvePoint’s common stock equal to such portion of the Company Earn-Out Shares issuable with respect to the unvested options (the “
Company Earn-Out RSUs
”). In evaluation of the Company Earn-Out Shares and Company Earn-Out RSUs, management determined that the Company Earn-Out Shares represent derivatives to be marked to market at each reporting period, while the Company Earn-Out RSUs represent equity. Refer to “
Note 
16
 — Stock-Based Compensation
” for more information regarding the Company Earn-Out RSUs.

In order to capture the market conditions associated with the Company Earn-Out Shares, the Company applied an approach that incorporated a Monte Carlo simulation, which involved random iterations that took different future price paths over the Sponsor Earn-Out Shares’ contractual life based on the appropriate probability distributions. The fair value was determined by taking the average of the fair values under each Monte Carlo simulation trial. The Monte Carlo model requires highly subjective assumptions including the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, and the expected term of the earn-out shares. Significant increases or decreases to these inputs in isolation could result in a significantly higher or lower liability. Under this approach, the fair value of the Company Earn-Out Shares on 
 July 1, 2021, 
was determined to be $
29.6
 million. The fair value was remeasured as of 
 December 31, 2023
,
 and was determined to be $
18.3
 million, and included in the earn-out shares’ liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. As a result, an $
11.1
 million increase and a $
4.3
 million decrease in liability were recognized during the years ended 
 December 31, 2023

and 
2022,
 respectively, and included as other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations.

Table of Contents

AvePoint, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

In 
 December 2024, 
the required provisions were met, leading to the issuance of 
2,964,658
 Company Earn-Out Shares and a payment of $
0.6
 million to certain holders of common stock and options. The Company Earn-Out Shares liability was measured at fair value using the Company’s stock quoted price on the date each milestone was achieved. The cumulative fair value of the shares issued and cash used for settlement amounted to $
54.5
 million, which was included in the earn-out shares’ liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. This resulted in a $
35.8
 million increase in liability recognized during the year ended 
 December 31, 2024, 
recorded as other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. Upon settlement, the Company Earn-out Shares settled in shares was reclassified from earn-out shares liabilities to equity, increasing the common stock amount and additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets by $
0.0
 million and $
53.9
 million, respectively. As of 
 December 31, 2024, 
there were 
no
 remaining earn-out shares liabilities.

We estimated the earn-out shares fair value using a Monte Carlo model with the following significant unobservable assumptions:

Private Warrants to Acquire Common Stock

On 
 July 1, 2021, 
the Company granted 
405,000
 private placement warrants with a 
5
-year term and exercise price of $
11.50
. Management has determined that the private placements warrants are to be classified as liabilities to be marked to market at each reporting period.

The private placement warrants are non-transferable and any transfer to an unrelated party would cause the warrants to be converted into public warrants. Consequently, the fair value of the private placement warrants is equivalent to the quoted price of the publicly traded warrants
.
 Under this approach, the fair value of the private placement warrants on 
 July 1, 2021, 
was determined to be $

Share Repurchase Program

On 
 March 17, 2022, 
the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program (the “
Share Repurchase Program
”) for the Company to buy back shares of its common stock. Under the Share Repurchase Program, the Company has the authority to buy up to $
150
 million of common stock via acquisitions in the open market or privately negotiated transactions. The Share Repurchase Program will remain open for a period of 
three
 years from the date of authorization and 
 may 
be suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company is 
not
 obligated to make purchases of, nor is it obligated to acquire any particular amount of, common stock under the Share Repurchase Program. During the years ended 
 December 31, 2024
, 
2023,
 and 
2022,
 the Company purchased 
3,262,065
, 
6,719,032
 and 
4,046,186
 shares, respectively, at an average price of $
10.13
, $
5.81
, and $
4.92
 per share, respectively.

Sponsor Earn-Out Shares

On 
 July 1, 2021 
the Company modified the terms of 
2,916,700
 shares of common stock (“
Sponsor Earn-Out Shares
”) then held by Apex’s sponsor, such that such shares will be subject to the following vesting provisions:

■
100%
 of the Sponsor Earn-Out Shares shall vest and be released if at any time through 
 July 1, 2028, 
AvePoint’s stock price is greater than or equal to 
$15.00
 (as adjusted for share splits, share capitalization, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) over any 
20
 trading days within any 
30
-day trading period; and

■
100%
 of the remaining Sponsor Earn-Out Shares that have 
not
 previously vested shall vest and be released if at any time through 
 July 1, 2028, 
the Company consummates a subsequent transaction.

The Sponsor Earn-Out Shares are currently outstanding and receive treatment as outstanding common shares except that they were held in escrow and restricted from transfer until the vesting conditions described above were met. Consequently, the shares are classified as equity. 

In 
 December 2024, 
the vesting conditions were satisfied and the shares were released from escrow.

Public Warrants to Acquire Common Stock

On 
 July 1, 2021, 
the Company issued 
17,500,000
 public warrants with an exercise price of $
11.50
. Each warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase 
one
 share of AvePoint’s common stock and the warrants are exercisable from the date of issuance through 
 July 1, 2026. 
The public warrants are equity classified and their fair value, based on the publicly traded warrants, was $
59.3
 million on 
 July 1, 2021, 
and included in the additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. 

On 
 August 27, 2024, 
the Company announced the commencement of an offer to purchase all of its outstanding public warrants at a price of $
2.50
 per warrant in cash, with an expiration date of 
 September 26, 2024 (
the “
Offer
”). On 
 September 26, 2024, 
the Company announced that 
1,596,314
 warrants had been validly tendered and purchased, representing approximately 
9.1
% of the outstanding warrants, for a total amount of $
4.0
 million. During the year ended 
 December 31, 2024, 
1,494,127
 warrants were exercised, with a total cash received of $
17.2
 million. As of 
 December 31, 2024, 
14,485,809
 warrants remained outstanding. Subsequent to 
 December 31, 2024, 
and through 
 February 21, 2025, 
holders of the Company’s outstanding warrants exercised a total of 
7,595,099
 warrants, resulting in the issuance of 
7,595,099
 shares of common stock. The Company received aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $
87.3
 million from these exercises. 

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest

AEPL PTE. LTD. (“
AEPL
”), an unaffiliated investor

As part of AEPL’s investment in MaivenPoint Pte. Ltd. (“
MaivenPoint
”), the Company granted AEPL a put option which grants AEPL the right to require the Company to repurchase AEPL’s investment in MaivenPoint at any time between 
 December 24, 2022, 
and 
 December 24, 2023, 
at a price equal to AEPL’s initial investment of approximately $
8.3
 million. The Company recorded AEPL’s investment in MaivenPoint as redeemable noncontrolling interest as mezzanine equity in its consolidated balance sheets. On 
 December 24, 2023, 
the put option expired. The redeemable noncontrolling interest owned by AEPL was reclassified to permanent equity and is presented in the stockholders’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets for the year ended 
 December 31, 2023.

I-Access Solutions Pte. Ltd. (“
I-Access
”)

On 
 February 18, 2022, (
the “
I-Access Closing Date
”), MaivenPoint consummated its acquisition of all of the ordinary shares of I-Access, a Singapore limited company. As a result, I-Access became a wholly owned subsidiary of MaivenPoint. The acquisition was made pursuant to a share purchase agreement, dated as of 
 January 31, 2022, (
the “
Share Purchase Agreement
”), by and among MaivenPoint and the former I-Access shareholders (the “
Former Shareholders
”). As part of the transaction price, MaivenPoint granted I-Access a put option which allows I-Access to cause MaivenPoint to repurchase its shares on 
 February 18, 2024, 
at a price equal to approximately $
5.9
 million. The Company recorded I-Access investment in MaivenPoint as redeemable noncontrolling interest as mezzanine equity in its consolidated balance sheets.

During the year ended 
 December 31, 2024, 
the Former Shareholders exercised the put option of approximately $
6.1
 million. As a result of the exercise, AvePoint’s ownership in MaivenPoint was 
76.1
%, with the remaining ownership interest held by AEPL as of 
 December 31, 2024. 
Due to the exercise of the put option, the Company adjusted the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest by multiplying the adjusted net assets of MaivenPoint AEPL’s new ownership percentage, resulting in a reduction to noncontrolling interest and increase in additional paid-in capital of $
6.4
 million, respectively, within the consolidated balance sheets. 

There were 
no
 put options held by MaivenPoint’s remaining noncontrolling interest shareholders, and therefore, there was 
no
 redeemable noncontrolling interest in MaivenPoint as of 
 December 31, 2024.

As of 
 December 31, 2024 
and 
2023,
 AvePoint owned 
76.1
% and 
73.8
%, respectively, interest in MaivenPoint.

15.
 Growth Equity Fund

On 
 February 28, 2024, 
the Company and Lumens Capital Partners Ltd. (“
LCP
”) established 
A3V
 JV Co. (the “
Venture
”), with each owning an equal share of the Venture. In addition, the Company entered into a separate agreement with LCP to form 
A3
 Ventures Fund 
1,
 L.P. (the “
Fund
”). The Fund is a Cayman Islands-exempted limited partnership, aimed at investing in companies in the growth equity phase and mature cashflow generating businesses with strong growth potential. The Fund looks to invest in companies situated in enterprise software markets aligning with the professional expertise and geographical presence of both the Company and LCP.

The Venture wholly owns 
A3V
 GP Co., which serves as the general partner of the Fund. As a limited partner, the Company committed to contribute $
50.0
 million to the Fund, to be called as needed, for portfolio investments, fees, and expenses of the Fund. The Company also participates in Fund establishment costs and an annual management fee equal to 
2.0
% of the total commitment. Any future repayment obligations will be triggered upon the receipt by LCP of profit allocations related to the Fund.

As of 
 December 31, 2024, 
no
 portion of the Company’s $
50.0
 million commitment has been called or was callable, and the operations of the Fund and the Venture have 
not
 materially impacted the Company’s financial position, financial performance, or cash flows.

As of 
 December 31, 2024, 
$
2.4
 million of management fee and establishment costs were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. During the year ended 
 December 31, 2024
,
 $
2.4
 million of management fee and establishment costs were included in general and administrative in the consolidated statements of operations.

 Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company maintains the 
2021
 Equity Incentive Plan (the “
2021
 Plan
”). As of 
 December 31, 2024, 
27,186,959
 shares remained for future issuance under the 
2021
 Plan. To date, the Company has issued only stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants.

Stock-based compensation was included in the following line items in the consolidated statements of operations:

, 
2023
 and 
2022
 was $
9.5
 million, $
2.5
 million and $
2.2
 million, respectively.

Stock Options 

The compensation costs for stock option awards are recognized using the straight-line attribution method over the requite service period and are accounted for forfeitures as they occur. Stock options vest over a 
four
-year service period and expire on the 
tenth
 anniversary of the date of award.

Certain of the Company’s stock option awards (the “
Officer Awards
”) included a provision that required the Company to redeem the vested portion of options at fair value in cash upon a separation of service initiated by the Company or upon death or disability of the holder. The Company determined that the redemption feature required the Officer Awards to be classified in mezzanine equity prior to the Apex Business Combination. For share-based payment arrangements with employees, the amount presented in mezzanine equity at each balance sheet date was based on the redemption provisions of the instrument and adjusted for the proportion of consideration received in the form of employee services. The shares underlying the Officer Awards were puttable to the Company upon certain conditions, such as death or disability of the Officer Awards recipients, which the Company determined was 
not
 probable; therefore, the Company reclassified the grant-date intrinsic value to mezzanine equity as the awards vested. The Officer Awards were cancelled in 
2021,
 concurrent with the Apex Business Combination. In exchange for the cancellation of the Officer Awards, the Company agreed to deliver to the holders of the Officer Awards a fixed amount of shares equal to the amount of shares the holders would have received if the Officer Awards were exercised on the date of the Apex Business Combination in a net share settlement scenario. The cancelled Officer Awards were treated as modification of the original awards; however, 
no
 incremental value exists as a result of the modification. As a result of the cancellation of the original Officer Awards, the $
1.7
 million mezzanine balance was reclassified to permanent equity on 
 July 1, 2021, 
and the Company recognized $
3.5
 million in previously unrecognized compensation costs. As a result, the Company issued 
3,592,504
 shares in 
 July 
2022.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted in the years ended 
 December 31, 2024
, 
2023
 and 
2022
 was $
4.26
, $
2.49
 and $

Restricted Stock Units

Under the terms of the 
2021
 Plan, we have issued stock unit awards with a continuous employment condition only (“
Time-Based RSUs
”), and restricted stock unit awards with a continuous employment condition that are also contingent on the Company meeting certain performance goals (“
PSUs
”, and together “
RSUs
”). Both types of RSU awards vest over a 
four
-year period from the grant date.

The compensation costs for RSUs are recognized using the straight-line attribution method over the requite service period and are accounted for forfeitures as they occur. RSUs are measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date.

2021
 Plan. This unrecognized stock-based compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 
2.4
 years.

Company Earn-Out RSUs

The compensation costs for Company Earn-Out RSUs are recognized using the straight-line attribution method over the requite service period and are accounted for forfeitures as they occur. In order to capture the market conditions associated with the Company Earn-Out RSUs, the Company applied an approach that incorporated a Monte Carlo simulation, which involved random iterations that took different future price paths over the Sponsor Earn-Out RSUs’ contractual life based on the appropriate probability distributions. The fair value was determined by taking the average of the fair values under each Monte Carlo simulation trial. Under this approach, the grant-date fair value of the Company Earn-Out RSUs on 
 July 1, 2021, 
was determined to be $
2.5
 million. The stock options underlying the Earn-Out RSUs vest over a 
four
-year period and expire on the 
tenth
 anniversary of the date of award. If the contingent milestones of the Earn-Out RSUs are 
not
 met by the 
seventh
 anniversary of the Apex Business Combination, the holders of the underlying stock options will 
not
 receive the Earn-Out RSUs. As of 
 December 31, 2024, 
all Company Earn-Out RSUs are fully vested. For the years ended 
 December 31, 2024
, 
2023
 and 
2022,
 the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $
0.3
 million, $
0.9
 million and $
0.9
 million, respectively, related to these Earn-Out RSUs.

 Fair Value Measurements

Fair value is the price that would be received upon selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a 
three
-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The 
three
 levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:

■

Level 
1
 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date.

■

Level 
2
 — Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 
1
 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

■

Level 
3
 — Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

 Segment information 

The Company manages its business activities on a consolidated basis and operates in a single operating segment. Its products and services are sold throughout the world, through direct and indirect sales channels. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (the “
CODM
”) is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM makes operating performance assessment and resource allocation decisions on a consolidated basis. The CODM does 
not
 review assets in evaluating the results of the segment.

The accounting policies of the segment are the same as those described in “
Note 
2
 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
”. The CODM assesses performance for the consolidated entity and decides how to allocate resources based on net income (loss) reported on the consolidated statements of operations. The CODM uses net income (loss) to monitor budgeted versus actual results and to conduct competitive analysis by benchmarking against industry peers. Additionally, net income (loss) serves as a basis for making strategic decisions, such as acquisitions and reinvestments into business, and establishing management compensation linked to segment performance.

The following table sets forth the information about the Company’s reported segment revenue, segment profit or loss, and significant segment expenses:

 Loss Per Share 

Basic loss per share available to the Company’s common shareholders (“
EPS
”) is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. In computing diluted EPS, the Company adjusts the denominator, subject to anti-dilution requirements, to include the dilution from potential shares of common stock resulting from outstanding share-based payment awards, warrants, earn-outs and the conversion of convertible preferred shares. The Company applies the 
two
-class method in calculating loss per share. The Company’s Sponsor Earn-Out Shares described in “
Note 
14
 — Mezzanine Equity and Stockholders’
 Equity
” are considered participating securities and have 
no
 contractual obligation to shares in the loss of the Company. As such, the weighted-average impact of these shares is excluded from the calculation of loss per share below. As losses were incurred during all periods presented, 
no
 earnings per share exists for the Sponsor Earn-Out Shares until vested.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (in his capacity as “
Principal Executive Officer
”) and our Chief Financial Officer (in his capacity as “
Principal Financial and Accounting Officer
”), we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.

Previously Disclosed Material Weaknesses

In fiscal year 2023, the Company identified a material weakness in our design of controls, particularly around ensuring accuracy and completeness of the information used in our controls. During fiscal year 2024, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, the Company implemented a remediation plan (the “
Remediation Plan
”), to address the material weakness identified in 2023. The Remediation Plan consisted of, but was not limited to

■

enhancing the design of controls that address the accuracy and completeness of reports being utilized in the execution of internal controls; and

■

establishing additional training related to addressing the accuracy and completeness of data used in controls and the level of documentation required to evidence control activities

We have implemented documented policies and procedures for, and have tested the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of, the newly designed and enhanced controls. Based upon that testing, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer concluded that our previously disclosed material weakness has been remediated as of December 31, 2024.

Management
’
s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our system of internal control was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with GAAP. Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “
COSO framework
”). Based on management’s assessment, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touch LLP, has issued an audit report with respect to our internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 9a in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Other than described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of AvePoint, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of AvePoint, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control 
—
 Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control 
—
 Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 , of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
