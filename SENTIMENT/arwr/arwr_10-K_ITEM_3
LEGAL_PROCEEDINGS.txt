MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
OVERVIEW
The Company develops medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them. Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, the Company’s therapies trigger the RNAi interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes. RNAi is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. RNAi-based therapeutics may leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing to target and shut down specific disease-causing genes. 
The Company believes that TRiM
TM
 enabled therapeutics offer several potential advantages over prior generation and competing technologies, including: simplified manufacturing and reduced costs; multiple routes of administration including subcutaneous injection and inhaled administration; the ability to target multiple tissue types including liver, lung, central nervous system (CNS), muscle, and adipose tissue; and the potential for improved safety and reduced risk of intracellular buildup, because there are fewer metabolites from smaller, simpler molecules. 
The Company’s pipeline includes:
•
Hypertriglyceridemia - plozasiran (formerly ARO-APOC3)
•
Dyslipidemia - zodasiran (formerly ARO-ANG3)
•
Cardiovascular disease - olpasiran (formerly AMG 890 or ARO-LPA, out-licensed to Amgen) 
•
Muco-obstructive or inflammatory pulmonary conditions - ARO-MUC5AC and ARO-RAGE
•
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - ARO-MMP7
•
Metabolic-dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH) - GSK-4532990 (formerly ARO-HSD, out licensed to GSK);
•
Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) - fazirsiran (formerly ARO-AAT, a collaboration with Takeda)
•
Chronic hepatitis B virus - daplusiran/tomligisiran (GSK5637608, formerly JNJ-3989, out-licensed to GSK) 
•
Complement mediated diseases - ARO-C3
•
Metabolic-dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH) - ARO-PNPLA3 (formerly JNJ-75220795 or ARO-JNJ1);
•
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy - ARO-DUX4;
•
Dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) - ARO-DM1;
•
Hepatic expression of complement factor B (CFB) - ARO-CFB
•
Obesity - ARO-INHBE; and
•
Spinocerebellar ataxia 2 - ARO-ATXN2
The Company operates lab facilities in California and Wisconsin, where its research and development activities, including the development of RNAi therapeutics, take place. The Company’s principal executive offices are located in Pasadena, California.
The Company continues to develop other clinical candidates for future clinical trials. Clinical candidates are tested internally and through GLP toxicology studies at outside laboratories. Drug materials for such studies and clinical trials are either manufactured internally or contracted to third-party manufacturers. The Company engages third-party contract research organizations (CROs) to manage clinical trials and works cooperatively with such organizations on all aspects of clinical trial management, including plan design, patient recruiting, and follow up. These outside costs, including toxicology/efficacy testing and manufacturing costs, as well as the preparation for and administration of clinical trials, are referred to as “candidate costs.” As clinical candidates progress through clinical development, candidate costs will increase.
2024 Business Highlights
During fiscal year 2024, the Company continued to develop and advance its pipeline and partnered candidates and expand its facilities to support its growing programs. The bullets below highlight some of these key developments; however, this list is not all-inclusive and is meant to be read in conjunction with the entirety of management’s discussion and analysis, the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto, and all other items contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

2024 Financial Performance Summary
Net loss attributable to Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was $599.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $205.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2023. Net loss per share – diluted was $5.00 for the year ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $1.92 for the year ended September 30, 2023. The change in net loss for the year ended September 30, 2024 was mainly due to a decrease in revenue from the Company’s license and collaboration agreements, in conjunction with increased research and development expenses, which have continued to increase as the Company’s pipeline of candidates has expanded and progressed through clinical trial phases.
The Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Jefferies LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., and Cowen and Company, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters. The Company issued 15,790,000 shares of common stock at a price of $28.50 per share. The aggregate purchase price paid by investors was $450.0 million and the Company received net proceeds of $429.3 million after deducting advisory fees and offering expenses.
Further, the Company entered into a financing agreement with Sixth Street Lending Partners, as representatives of the several lenders. The financing agreement provides for a senior secured term loan facility of $500.0 million, which includes $400.0 million funded on the closing date with an additional $100.0 million at the Company’s option during the seven-year term of the agreement. The Company received net proceeds of $388.9 million, after issuance costs as of September 30, 2024. This is discussed further in Note 14, Financing Agreements of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, “Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.”
The Company had $102.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and $578.3 million in available-for-sale securities as of September 30, 2024, as compared to $110.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and $292.7 million in available-for-sale securities as of September 30, 2023. Based upon the Company’s current cash and 
64
investment resources and operating plan, the Company expects to have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements. 
Critical Accounting Estimates 
Management makes certain judgments and uses certain estimates and assumptions when applying U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, judgments and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expense. Actual results may vary from what the Company anticipates and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change its reported results. The Company believes the following accounting policies are the most critical to it, in that they require its most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. For further information, see Note 1, Organization and Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, “Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.” 
Revenue Recognition
—The Company has adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Topic 606 – 
Revenue for Contracts from Customers. 
The Company has not yet achieved commercial sales of its drug candidates to date, however, this standard is applicable to its licensing and collaboration agreements. This is discussed further in Note 2, Collaboration and License Agreements of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, “Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.”
At contract inception, the Company assesses whether the goods or services promised within each contract are distinct and, therefore, represent a separate performance obligation, or whether they are not distinct and are combined with other goods and services until a distinct bundle is identified. The Company then determines the transaction price, which typically includes upfront payments and any variable consideration that it determines is probable to not cause a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company then allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation and recognizes the associated revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied. 
The Company recognizes the transaction price allocated to upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license to the customer and resulting ability of the customer to use and benefit from the license, if the license is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the contract. These other performance obligations are typically to perform research and development services for the customer, often times relating to the candidate that the customer is licensing. If the license is not considered to be distinct from other performance obligations, the Company assesses the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time. If the performance obligation is satisfied over time, the Company then determines the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from license payments. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the related revenue recognition. 
Typically, the Company’s collaboration agreements entitle it to additional payments upon the achievement of milestones or royalties on sales. The milestones are generally categorized into three types: development milestones, generally based on the initiation of toxicity studies or clinical trials; regulatory milestones, generally based on the submission, filing or approval of regulatory applications such as a NDA in the United States; and sales-based milestones, generally based on meeting specific thresholds of sales in certain geographic areas. The Company evaluates whether it is probable that the consideration associated with each milestone or royalty will not be subject to a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized. Amounts that meet this threshold are included in the transaction price using the most-likely-amount method, whereas amounts that do not meet this threshold are excluded from the transaction price until they meet this threshold. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized for its milestones and royalties, and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and net income in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Typically, milestone payments and royalties are achieved after the Company’s performance obligations associated with the collaboration agreements have been completed and after the customer has assumed responsibility for the respective clinical or preclinical program. Milestones or royalties achieved after the Company’s performance obligations have been completed are recognized as revenue in the period the milestone or royalty was achieved. If a milestone payment is achieved during the performance period, the milestone payment would be recognized as revenue to the extent performance had been completed at that point, and the remaining balance would be recorded as deferred revenue. 
The revenue standard requires the Company to assess whether a significant financing component exists in determining the transaction price. The Company performs this assessment at the onset of its licensing or collaboration 
65
agreements. Typically, a significant financing component does not exist because the customer is paying for a license or services in advance with an upfront payment. Additionally, future royalty payments are not substantially within the control of the Company or the customer. 
The revenue standard requires the Company to allocate the arrangement consideration on a relative standalone selling price basis for each performance obligation after determining the transaction price of the contract and identifying the performance obligations to which that amount should be allocated. The relative standalone selling price is defined in the revenue standard as the price at which an entity would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. If other observable transactions in which the Company has sold the same performance obligation separately are not available, the Company estimates the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price may include forecasted revenues, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success.
Whenever we determine that goods or services promised in a contract should be accounted for as a combined performance obligation over time, the Company determines the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized. Revenue is recognized using the input method. Labor hours, costs incurred or patient visits in clinical trials are typically used as the measure of performance. Significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which the Company is expected to complete its performance obligations. If the Company determines that the performance obligation is satisfied over time, any upfront payment received is initially recorded as deferred revenue on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. 
Collaborative Arrangements
—The Company analyzes its collaborative arrangements to assess whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards, and therefore an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, either by analogy to appropriate accounting literature or by applying a reasonable accounting policy election. For collaborative arrangements that are within the scope of FASB Topic 808—
Collaborative Arrangements
, the Company evaluates the income statement classification for presentation of amounts due to or owed from other participants associated with multiple units of account in a collaborative arrangement based on the nature of each activity. Payments or reimbursements that are the result of a collaborative relationship instead of a customer relationship, such as co-development and co-commercialization activities, are recorded as increases or decreases to research and development expense or general and administrative expense, as appropriate. 
Clinical Accruals
—The Company accrues liabilities for products received or services incurred, particularly for ongoing clinical trials, where service providers have not yet billed or where billing terms do not align with the timing of the work performed as of the period-end. These costs mainly include third-party clinical management or clinical research organization (CRO), laboratory analysis, and investigator fees. Accrual estimates may be based on vendor communications to obtain pending invoices and/or estimates for services performed during the period. In some cases, these estimates require judgment, drawing on an understanding of research and development programs, services provided during the period, prior experience, and, where applicable, the expected duration of third-party contracts. Actual costs upon settlement may differ significantly from the accrued amounts in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, though historical estimates have not differed materially from actual costs.
Liability Related to the Sale of Future Royalties
—Based on its evaluation of the agreement terms, the Company classifies the liability related to the sale of future royalties as a debt financing. The Company records the obligations at their carrying value using the effective interest method. In order to amortize the sale of future royalties, the Company utilizes the prospective method to estimate the future royalties to be paid by the Company to the counterparty over the life of the arrangement. Under the prospective method, a new effective interest rate is determined based on the revised estimate of remaining cash flows. The new rate is the discount rate that equates the present value of the revised estimate of remaining cash flows with the carrying amount of the debt, and it will be used to recognize non-cash interest expense for the remaining periods. The Company periodically assesses the amount and the timing of expected royalty payments using a combination of internal projections and forecasts from external sources. The estimates of future net product sales (and resulting royalty payments) are based on key assumptions including population, penetration, probability of success and sales price, among others. To the extent such payments are greater or less than the Company’s initial estimates or the timing of such payments is different than its original estimates, the Company will prospectively adjust the amortization of the royalty financing obligations and the effective interest rate.

Revenue
Total revenue for the year ended September 30, 2024 decreased to $3.6 million, 98.5%, from the same period of 2023. The changes were primarily driven by decreased revenue recognition associated with the Company’s license and collaboration agreements during the year ended September 30, 2024. The Company has evaluated each agreement in accordance with FASB Topic 808–
Collaborative Arrangements
 and Topic 606-
Revenue for Contracts from Customers
. See Note 2 — Collaboration and License Agreements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part IV, “Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.”
Takeda
: In October 2020, Takeda and the Company entered into the Takeda License Agreement. The Company determined that they key deliverables included the license and specific R&D services. Given the specialized and unique nature of the R&D services, the Company concluded that these deliverables represent one combined performance obligation. The Company allocated the total $300.0 million initial transaction price to its one distinct performance obligation for the fazirsiran license and the associated Takeda R&D Services. Revenue was recognized using the input method (based on actual patient visits completed versus total estimated visits completed for the ongoing SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 clinical studies). The Phase 2 study visits for patients in the SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 studies concluded by December 31, 2023, and the Company has substantially completed its performance obligation under the Takeda License Agreement. As such, all revenue has been fully recognized as of December 31, 2023.  
During the fiscal year of 2023, the Company recorded $162.5 million of revenue, including a $40.0 million milestone payment by dosing the first patient in the Phase 3 REDWOOD clinical study of fazirsiran.
GSK
: On December 11, 2023, GSK and the Company entered into the GSK-HBV Agreement. Under the GSK-HBV Agreement, GSK received a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize daplusiran/tomligisiran (GSK5637608, formerly JNJ-3989). Daplusiran/tomligisiran had previously been licensed to Janssen in October 2018. Under the terms of the GSK-HBV Agreement, the Company received $2.7 million during fiscal year 2024 upon signing the GSK-HBV Agreement.
On November 22, 2021, GSK and the Company entered into the GSK-HSD License Agreement. Under the GSK-HSD License Agreement, GSK has received an exclusive license for GSK-4532990. The Company has completed its performance obligation related to this agreement, and the upfront payment of $120.0 million was fully recognized in the year ended September 30, 2022. Further, during fiscal year 2023, the Company recorded a $30.0 million milestone payment by dosing the first patient in a Phase 2b trial under GSK-HSD License Agreement.
Horizon/Amgen
: During the fiscal year of 2023, the Company recognized $6.7 million of the total $40.0 million upfront payment received in July 2021, which was recognized on a straight-line basis over the timeframe for completing the Horizon R&D Services, concluding in the first quarter of 2023. There was also $1.5 million of reimbursable costs. Horizon enrolled the first subject in December 2022 in a Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of HZN-457, triggering a $15.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Further, Amgen enrolled the first subject in its Phase 3 trial of olpasiran, which triggered a $25.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. On October 6, 2023, Amgen Inc. completed its acquisition of Horizon and subsequently notified the Company of Amgen’s intent to terminate the HZN-457 license. Horizon exercised its right to terminate the Horizon License Agreement for convenience, which took effect on December 21, 2023.

Operating Expenses
The analysis below details the operating expenses and discusses the expenditures of the Company within the major expense categories. For purposes of comparison, the amounts for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are shown in the tables below. 
Research and Development (R&D) Expenses
R&D expenses are related to the Company’s research and development discovery efforts and related candidate costs, which are comprised primarily of outsourced costs related to the manufacturing of clinical supplies, toxicity/efficacy studies and clinical trial expenses. Internal costs primarily relate to discovery operations at the Company’s research facilities in California and Wisconsin, including facility costs and laboratory-related expenses. The Company does not separately track R&D expenses by individual research and development projects, or by individual drug candidates. The Company operates in a cross-functional manner across projects and does not separately allocate facilities-related costs, candidate costs, discovery costs, compensation expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, and other expenses related to research and development activities.

Candidate costs increased $96.8 million, or 60%, for the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. This increase was primarily due to the additional progression of the Company’s pipeline of candidates into and through clinical trials, which resulted in higher manufacturing, outsourced clinical trial, and toxicity study costs.
R&D discovery costs increased $18.6 million, or 33%, for the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. This increase was primarily driven by the growth of the Company’s discovery efforts and continued advancement into novel therapeutic areas and tissue types, 
along with rising costs associated with central nervous system (CNS) studies and lab supplies. 
Salaries consist of salary, bonuses, payroll taxes, and related benefits for the Company’s R&D personnel. Salaries expense increased $22.8 million, or 31%, for the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in R&D headcount that has occurred as the Company has expanded its pipeline of candidates, in addition to annual salary increases.  
Facilities-related expense includes lease costs for the Company’s research and development facilities in San Diego, California and in Madison and Verona, Wisconsin. These expenses increased $9.5 million, or 58%, for the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to full-year expenses such as utilities and repair and maintenance charges associated with the new facilities in San Diego, California and Verona, Wisconsin 
Stock compensation expense, a non-cash expense, is based upon the valuation of stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees. Stock compensation expense decreased $0.7 million, or 2%, for the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the cancellation of awards upon the departure of employees.
Depreciation and amortization expense, a non-cash expense, relates to depreciation on building, lab equipment and leasehold improvements. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $5.8 million, or 53% for the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily attributed to higher leasehold improvements due to completion of the development of the San Diego facility. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, the Company completed the build out of one of its laboratory and office facilities in Verona, Wisconsin, and commenced depreciation.
68
The Company anticipates these R&D expenses to continue to increase as its pipeline of candidates grows and progresses to later phase clinical trials, in addition to inflationary pressure on goods and services and the labor market.

Salaries expense increased $4.6 million, or 20%, for the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was driven by the combination of annual salary increases and increased headcount required to support the Company’s growth.
Professional, outside services, and other expenses include costs related to legal, audit, consulting, patent filings, business insurance, other external services, as well as travel, communication, and technology expenses. This expense increased $4.0 million, or 19%, for the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by legal services associated with patent applications and intellectual property matters, as well as other professional services.
Facilities related expense primarily includes rental costs and other facilities-related costs for the Company’s corporate headquarters in Pasadena, California. 
Stock compensation expense, a non-cash expense, is based on the valuation of stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees. This expense decreased by $3.4 million, or 8%, for the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The decrease was mainly due to lower compensation costs related to performance awards, as the timing of these expenses can vary based on the achievement of related performance targets.
Depreciation and amortization expense, a noncash expense, was primarily related to amortization of leasehold improvements for the Company’s corporate headquarters. 
Other than with respect to the stock compensation costs described above, the Company anticipates these general and administrative expenses to increase as its pipeline of candidates grows and progresses to later phase clinical trials including commercialization efforts, in addition to inflationary pressure on goods and services and the labor market.
Other Income (Expense)
Other income (expense) is primarily related to interest income and expense. Other expense increased $9.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was mainly due to non-cash interest expense associated with the liability related to the sale of future royalties and the Credit Facility, partially offset by higher income from increased investment yields due to higher average cash balance. 
Year Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2022

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The Company has historically financed its operations through the sale of its equity securities, credit facility, revenue from its licensing and collaboration agreements, and the sale of certain future royalties. Research and development activities have required significant investment since the Company’s inception and are expected to continue to require significant cash expenditure as the Company’s pipeline continues to expand and matures into later stage clinical trials, including commercialization efforts. Additionally, the Company expanded its facilities in Verona, Wisconsin and leased additional facilities in San Diego, California. Each of these expansions is designed to increase the Company’s internal manufacturing and discovery capabilities and requires significant capital investment.
