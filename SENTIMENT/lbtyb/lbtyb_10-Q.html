(C) Each Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the initial Chairman appointed  pursuant to clause 2(A)(vi) (Establishment of the Company) is nominated by the  Liberty Global Shareholder and each Shareholder agrees that the Telef&oacute;nica  Shareholder shall appoint the second Chairman and that the right to appoint the  Chairman shall thereafter alternate between the Shareholders.

A Director shall be    59           considered to be unable to act within the meaning of the preceding sentence in  the case of:  (i) him having been ill, or the Company not having been able to contact  him, in each case for a period of at least fourteen consecutive calendar  days (or such other period as determined by the Board on the basis of  the facts and circumstances at hand);  (ii) his suspension;   (iii) him having notified the Company in writing that he is unable to act; or  (iv) him having declared to have, or the Board having established that he  has, a conflict of interest.

(C) A person acting as an Alternate shall have one vote at meetings of the Board  (and its committees) for each Director for whom the person acts as Alternate  and shall, for the purposes of determining whether a quorum is present, be  counted as one person for each Director for whom the person acts as Alternate.   For the avoidance of doubt, if a Director is also acting as an Alternate, then that  Director shall have an additional vote for each Director that he is also acting as  Alternate for.  (D) Upon a Director ceasing to hold office any Alternates appointed by him or on his  behalf shall cease to function in that role.  6.5 Exercise of Shareholder rights  Each Shareholder shall, so far as it is legally able, exercise its rights in relation to the  Company to vote in favour of the appointment, removal or replacement of a Director  nominated or requested to resign in accordance with clause 6.1 (Appointment and  removal of Directors), as soon as reasonably practicable after such nomination or  request to resign has been made, and to procure that no person is appointed as a  Director other than pursuant to the Liberty Global Shareholder&#8217;s and the Telef&oacute;nica  Shareholder&#8217;s rights under clause 6.1 (Appointment and removal of Directors).    60           6.6 Appointment and removal of CTIL Directors   (A) The Liberty Global Shareholder shall be entitled, by giving written notice to the  Company (with a copy to the Telef&oacute;nica Shareholder), to nominate two CTIL  Directors from time to time (including with the purpose to fill any vacancy) and  the Company shall procure that the CTIL Shareholder nominates such  individuals for appointment as CTIL Directors in accordance with such request  and the terms of the CTIL Shareholders&#8217; Agreement.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD  8.1 Convening Board meetings  Any Director may call a meeting of the Board.  The Board shall hold meetings in the UK  (unless at least one Liberty Global Director and one Telef&oacute;nica Director agree  otherwise) and, unless both Shareholders agree to a lesser number of meetings in an  Accounting Period, meetings of the Board shall be held at least six times in each  Accounting Period, with an update conference call on the Business and operations of  the Company and its Group to be held once between each meeting of the Board (unless  at least one Liberty Global Director and one Telef&oacute;nica Director agree otherwise).  8.2 Notice of Board meetings  At least five Business Days&#8217; notice of each meeting of the Board shall be given to each  Director entitled to attend and the notice shall be accompanied by an agenda and a  board paper setting out in such reasonable detail as may be practicable in the  circumstances the subject matter of the meeting.  A shorter period of notice may be  given with the consent and presence of at least two Liberty Global Directors and two  Telef&oacute;nica Directors.    8.3 Quorum at Board meetings  (A) Subject to clause 8.6, a quorum shall exist at any Board meeting if at least  three Liberty Global Directors and three Telef&oacute;nica Directors are present or  represented by an Alternate.  (B) If a quorum is not present at a meeting of the Board, such meeting shall be  adjourned.  The requirements in relation to notice, quorum, consent to short  notice and adjournment for an initial Board meeting shall apply to an adjourned  meeting.  (C) If a quorum is not present at a meeting which has been adjourned on one  occasion, such meeting shall be further adjourned. At least two Business Days&#8217;  notice shall be given to all Directors of the further adjourned meeting.  At the  further adjourned meeting, a quorum shall exist with respect to those matters on  the agenda which were not disposed of at the original meeting or the first    66           adjourned meeting if any two or more Directors are present or represented by  an Alternate.    (D) Nothing in this clause 8.3 shall affect the rights and obligations of the  Shareholders under clause 4 (Reserved Matters).  8.4 Voting at Board meetings  (A) Resolutions of the Board shall be decided by a simple majority vote of all votes  cast by the Directors present or represented by an Alternate provided that,  subject to clause 8.6, a vote in favour is made by at least one Liberty Global  Director and at least one Telef&oacute;nica Director, as long as at least one Liberty  Global Director and at least one Telef&oacute;nica Director is entitled to vote on the  relevant matter during the Board meeting, and each Director present or  represented by an Alternate shall have one vote.    (B) For resolutions of the Board proposed in accordance with clause 8.4(A), in the  event that a Director is not in attendance and has not appointed an Alternate to  vote, subject to clause 8.6, one of the other Directors nominated and appointed  upon request of the same Shareholder may cast another vote on behalf of the  absent Director, provided that such Director has been granted a power of  attorney by the absent Director.  8.5 Resolutions in writing  Subject to clause 8.6, resolutions of the Board may be passed in writing by their  circulation to each Director (which may be by means of several documents in the like  form) and their signature by at least a simple majority of all of the Directors who would  have been entitled to vote on the relevant matter and whose votes would have been  counted had it been proposed as a resolution at a Board meeting, including at least one  Liberty Global Director and one Telef&oacute;nica Director, provided that at least one Liberty  Global Director and at least one Telef&oacute;nica Director would have been entitled to vote on  the relevant matter and whose vote would have been counted had it been proposed as  a resolution at a Board meeting.  8.6 Director's interests  (A) A Director shall be excluded from the receipt of information, the participation in  discussion and/or making of decisions (whether at meetings of the Board or  otherwise) and shall not be counted in the quorum (nor shall his presence be  required in order to constitute a quorum if it would otherwise be required under  this agreement), nor shall he be entitled to vote, exclusively, in respect of any  Shareholder Dispute Matter involving the Shareholder upon whose request he  is nominated and appointed or any member of its Group (each a &#8220;Shareholder  Dispute Party&#8221; in relation to that Director).    67           (B) Except in respect of a Shareholder Dispute Matter with regard to the  Shareholder upon whose request the relevant Director is nominated and  appointed and subject where applicable to disclosure in accordance with  applicable law, the Articles of Association and/or any terms imposed by the  Directors in relation to conflict situations, a Director shall be counted in the  quorum and be entitled to vote at a meeting of the Board on any resolution in  respect of any matter, contract or proposed contract in which he is interested  directly or indirectly. For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that a Director has  been nominated and appointed by a Shareholder shall not, of itself, constitute a  conflict of interest.  (C) Subject to clauses 8.6(D) and 40 (Arbitration), any decisions, actions or  negotiations to be taken or conducted by the Company in relation to a  Shareholder Dispute Matter shall be the responsibility of the Executive  Management but subject to the supervision of those Directors that are entitled,  in accordance with this agreement and, in particular, with clause 8.6(B), to count  in the quorum and not those Directors who are not entitled, in accordance with   clause 8.6(B), to count in the quorum.  (D) No material decision, action or negotiation shall be taken or conducted by the  Company in relation to a Shareholder Dispute Matter without the approval of a  simple majority of those Directors who are authorised to supervise such  decisions, actions and negotiations in accordance with clause 8.6(B) subject to  their fiduciary duties to the Company.  8.7 Director's conflicts  If any Director believes that his fiduciary duties to the Company may conflict with his  obligations to the Shareholder upon whose request he is nominated and appointed,  such Director shall be entitled to withdraw from the receipt of information, the  participation in discussion and/or the making of decisions (whether at meetings of the  directors or otherwise), in which case such decision (including in relation to any  Reserved Matter) shall, subject to applicable law or regulation and clause 8.6, be  referred to the Shareholders for a decision either through written resolution or at a  general meeting of the Shareholders.  8.8 Participation arrangements  Any one or more Directors or Alternates may participate in and vote at Board meetings  by means of a conference telephone, video feed or any communication equipment  which allows all persons participating in the meeting to communicate to the others any  information or opinions they have on any particular item of business of the meeting.   Any Director or Alternate so participating in a meeting shall be deemed to be present in  person and shall count towards the quorum.    68           8.9 Remuneration of the Directors   The Shareholders shall, so far as they are legally able, exercise their rights in relation to  the Company to procure that the Company shall reimburse each Director for all  reasonable travelling, accommodation and other expenses reasonably incurred by any  Director in attending meetings of the Board or otherwise in connection with his functions  as a Director.   8.10 Observers  (A) Each Shareholder shall have the right to appoint and dismiss up to two  representatives (who shall each be an employee of that Shareholder, that  Shareholder's Ultimate Parent or of any Wholly-owned Affiliate of that  Shareholder's Ultimate Parent or of any member of its Group or a director or an  officer of that Shareholder's Ultimate Parent, provided that no such  representative is a member of the Executive Management) to attend meetings  of each of the Board and board meetings of each member of the Company&#8217;s  Group, and meetings of each of their respective committees (the &#8220;Observers&#8221;).   (B) Each Observer is entitled to speak but not vote or count in the quorum for any  such meeting (unless that Observer has been appointed a member of a  committee of the Board, in which case that Observer may vote and count in the  quorum for any such meeting of that committee). Each Observer shall have the  right to receive notice of meetings, and to receive the same information, in the  same form and at the same time as the relevant directors or members of the  relevant committee.  (C) Before an Observer is appointed by a Shareholder, he or she must enter into a  confidentiality undertaking in favour of the Company in the form approved by  the Board from time to time and the appointing Shareholder shall procure that  the Observer complies with the terms of that confidentiality undertaking.  (D) The appointment and dismissal of any Observer shall take effect upon delivery  of written notice signed by the appointing Shareholder to the Company (with a  copy to the other Shareholder).   (E) An Observer may appoint one other person (who shall also be an employee of a  Shareholder or of any member of its Group) to be their alternate, provided that  such alternate has entered into a confidentiality undertaking on the terms  described above in clause 8.10(C) and the appointing Shareholder shall procure  that the alternate complies with the terms of the confidentiality undertaking, and  such appointment may be for a specific meeting or for a specific or indefinite  duration. If an Observer is replaced or dismissed, any alternate appointed by  such Observer shall automatically be dismissed as such.  </FONT></DIV>

(G) If an Observer is, in any way, directly or indirectly, interested in an existing or a  proposed transaction or arrangement with the Company, he must declare the  nature and extent of that interest to the Directors and, in the case of a proposed  transaction or arrangement, he must make such declaration before the  transaction or arrangement is entered into and, provided he has done so, the  Observer shall be entitled to attend meetings and receive information relating to  that transaction or arrangement.  8.11 Standing Committees  (A) The Company shall establish an Audit Committee and a Remuneration  Committee and adopt the Terms of Reference at the first meeting of the Board  after the date of this agreement.

The financial reporting package shall include,  among other matters, an analysis of changes from prior year to current year  periods in the detail specified by the relevant Shareholder.  9.6 Accounts  (A) The Company shall provide, at its own cost, to each Shareholder:  (i) consolidated statutory audited accounts of the Company&#8217;s Group for  each 12 month period ending on 31 December, prepared in accordance  with the Accounting Policies;     74           (ii) consolidated audited accounts of the Company&#8217;s Group for each 12  month period ending on 31 December, prepared in accordance with  Liberty Global GAAP and audited under U.S. Generally Accepted  Auditing Standards or U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight  Board auditing standards (as determined by the Liberty Global  Shareholder),  in each case promptly following their approval in accordance with clause  4.2(A)(xxiv) by the Board and no later than two months after the end of the  relevant 12 month period unless required to be filed earlier by rules applicable  to either Shareholder or a member of its Group, or, to the extent they can be  accommodated without undue effort or disruption, by the transactional  requirements of either Shareholder or a member of its Group.   (B) The Shareholders and the Company each agree and acknowledge that the  intention of the Shareholders is to hold their investment in the Company on the  basis that it is not consolidated onto the balance sheets of their respective  audited accounts (whether prepared under Liberty Global IFRS, Telef&oacute;nica  IFRS or Liberty Global GAAP).  In the event of a change of accounting  standards or practices that might require one or both Shareholders to  consolidate their investment in the Company onto its balance sheet, the  Shareholders agree to discuss what changes may be made to avoid such  consolidation, provided always that no Shareholder shall be obliged to accept  any amendment to any of its rights under this agreement (including in respect of  the Reserved Matters or its right to have Directors nominated and appointed  upon its request) without its consent.  9.7 Audit costs  The Shareholders acknowledge that the auditors of the Liberty Global Shareholder&#8217;s  Group are the Auditors as at the date of this agreement.

Any costs and  expenses incurred in connection with this clause 9.8, including, but not limited to, the  cost of assessment, implementation, on-going administration, compliance and  necessary auditor attestation, shall be paid by the Company without reimbursement  from the Shareholders.   10. BUSINESS PLANS  10.1 The Company shall procure that the Executive Management shall prepare a draft  Business Plan which is submitted to the Board to replace the existing Business Plan (a  &#8220;Draft Revised Business Plan&#8221;) by no later than 60 calendar days prior to the end of  each Accounting Period following the date of this agreement, comprising (i) a detailed  operating budget for the 12 months comprising the next Accounting Period; and (ii) a  financial and strategic plan for the 36 months subsequent to the period covered by the  detailed operating budget, or in such other format as has been approved in accordance  with clause 4 (Reserved Matters).  10.2 Each Draft Revised Business Plan submitted to the Board in accordance with clause  10.1 shall address, but not be limited to, the items and subject matter of the Initial  Business Plan.  10.3 Each Draft Revised Business Plan shall be reviewed by the Board in conjunction with  the Executive Management and shall be finalised by the Executive Management (taking  into account the direction and comments of the Board) prior to the start of the period to  which it relates.  Promptly following such finalisation, the Draft Revised Business Plan  shall be proposed for approval by the Board and (subject to clause 4.2(A)(xxviii)  (Reserved Matters)) adopted as the Business Plan by the Board in accordance with  clause 8 (Proceedings of the Board).  The Board shall use reasonable endeavours to  approve the Business Plan under clause 10.1 prior to the start of the last month of the  Accounting Period.  10.4 In the event that a Draft Revised Business Plan is not approved and adopted as the  Business Plan by the Board, the Executive Management will continue to operate the  business of the Company in accordance with the most recent approved Business Plan.   In the event that the most recent approved Business Plan does not cover the next  applicable period under clause 10.1, the business of the Company shall be operated in  accordance with the most recently approved Business Plan, adjusted, where applicable,  to reflect the percentage change in the Consumer Prices Index (as published by the UK  Office for National Statistics) for the relevant period.   11. DIVIDEND POLICY  11.1 Subject to (i) the availability of sufficient distributable reserves to support dividends (but  without prejudice to the Company&#8217;s obligations under clause 11.3), an ability to buyback  Shares from each Shareholder, an ability to make upstream loans from the Company  (or any member of the Company&#8217;s Group) to each Shareholder (or any member of each  Shareholder&#8217;s Group) or an ability to make payments in respect of Shareholder Loans,    76           (ii) compliance with all then existing financing documentation of the Company and its  Group, (iii) adjustments for any one-off capital expenditure expressly approved in writing  by the Shareholders or expressly set out in the relevant 12 month operating budget of  the Business Plan and (iv) applicable law and regulation (including directors&#8217; fiduciary  duties), the Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the end of each  Quarterly Accounting Period, distribute to each Shareholder, in proportion to their  respective Percentage Interest, an amount equal to the Distributable Amount. The  Company shall give notice in writing to the Shareholders of the Distributable Amount  available for distribution as soon as it has been determined and the proposed  distribution payment date.  The means of distribution of the Distributable Amount shall  be by way of dividend, by way of the proportionate buyback of Shares by the Company,  by way of rateable repayment of principal and/or payment of any accrued interest on  any outstanding Shareholder Loans and/or upstream loans from the Company (or any  member of the Company&#8217;s Group) to each Shareholder (or any member of each  Shareholder&#8217;s Group), as determined by the Shareholders (acting jointly and having  considered the most efficient means of making the distribution from a tax perspective).  11.2 The Shareholders agree that the annual distribution guidance for the Company will be  expressed as a range, unless both Shareholders agree to an absolute amount, and that  the Company shall, on or about the time of the publication of the consolidated audited  accounts of the Company&#8217;s Group for each 12 month period ending on 31 December,  make such guidance as to its annual target distribution range for the following  Accounting Period publicly available. Each Shareholder agrees to use all reasonable  endeavours and to co-operate to ensure that the distributions from the Company&#8217;s  Group to the Shareholders are stable, predictable and grow over time as operating  performance improves, synergies are realised and organic free cash flow grows to  provide cash and/or the necessary leverage capacity for such distributions. The  Shareholders further agree that the common objective is dividend stability and  commitment to annual group free cash flow guidance and therefore, once the Company  gives such guidance for each year, the Shareholders agree to make distributions even if  the Leverage Ratio will exceed 5.0:1, provided that if the Company ends the year with a  Leverage Ratio above 5.0:1, the distribution policy for the following year will be set with  the objective of bringing the Leverage Ratio back towards 5.0:1 by 31 December of that  year, unless otherwise agreed by both Shareholders.    11.3 The Company shall use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that it is able to distribute  the Distributable Amount pursuant to clause 11.1, including upstreaming cash from  members of the Company&#8217;s Group to the Company and maximising the available  distributable reserves of the Company (including taking such actions as the Board  considers appropriate to increase the amount of distributable reserves by carrying out a  reduction of capital of the Company or of a subsidiary of the Company or otherwise),  subject to, in respect of the O2 Daisy Group only, clause 11.1 (Dividend Policy) of the  O2 Daisy Shareholders&#8217; Agreement. The Company shall, and shall procure that each  other member of the Company&#8217;s Group shall, consult with, and have regard to the  comments and suggestions of, the Shareholders as to the means of any distribution by  a member of the Company&#8217;s Group (other than the Company).  </FONT></DIV>

FUNDING AND CASH MANAGEMENT  12.1 It is the intention of the Shareholders and the Company that the Company is self- funding and all members of its Group should be capable of financing their activities on a  standalone basis.  12.2 Subject to clause 4 (Reserved Matters), and clauses 12.3, 12.4 and 12.7 below, the  parties acknowledge and agree that if the Board concludes that the Company's funding  requirements exceed its available cash resources from time to time, it will consider  whether or not to seek funding in the following order of priority:  (A) external debt financing on arm&#8217;s length terms without recourse to the  Shareholders; and  (B) if such further finance cannot be raised on terms reasonably acceptable to the  Board, to request from both Shareholders in proportion to each Shareholder&#8217;s  Percentage Interest either:   (i) Shareholder Loans on arm&#8217;s length terms; and/or  (ii) subscriptions, in cash, for additional Shares.  12.3 No Shareholder shall be obliged or permitted to provide any funding, whether in the  form of equity or debt, to the Company by way of subscription for further shares or by  way of loans or subscription for loan notes unless both Shareholders agree to provide  the funding in proportion to each Shareholder&#8217;s Percentage Interest and the  Shareholders agree in writing on the amount and method of providing the funding.  12.4 Notwithstanding clause 12.3, where the Board has made a request for further funding  pursuant to clause 12.2, but either Shareholder has declined to provide further funding  in accordance with clause 12.3, and, the Company&#8217;s Group is, at that time, in a financial  situation where, in the reasonable opinion of either Shareholder, the Company&#8217;s Group  is facing severe financial difficulties and requires emergency funding, either Shareholder  may, by giving written notice, request a meeting between senior representatives of each  Shareholder to discuss providing further shareholder funding to the Company. The  Shareholders shall ensure that such meeting takes place within 10 Business Days of  receipt of the notice and shall, at that meeting, discuss in good faith different options to    78           provide emergency funding to the Company, including in a manner other than on a pro  rata basis in proportion to each Shareholder&#8217;s Percentage Interest.  12.5 The Company's Group shall maintain an external committed revolving credit facility in  an aggregate amount between &pound;1 billion and &pound;1.5 billion at all times. The Company's  Group shall allow each of the RCF Banks to bid and be considered for ancillary banking  business of the Company's Group.   12.6 Cash collected by members of the Company&#8217;s Group (other than members of the O2  Daisy Group) shall be swept to a designated account of the Company or any member of  its Group and deposited for periods not exceeding 90 calendar days or for the period  until the estimated date of the next distribution in accordance with clause 11 (Dividend  Policy) (whichever is shorter).  Such deposits shall be made with money market funds  with a credit rating of AAA with at least one international credit rating agency and a net  asset value of at least &pound;500 million provided that such deposits shall not represent more  than five per cent. of the net asset value of any individual money market fund at any  time, save that a cash balance of up to &pound;10 million may be held with RCF Banks with a  credit rating of Baa1/BBB+ or better with at least one international credit rating agency.   12.7 Shareholder Loans  (A) Any Shareholder Loan shall be on terms such that it does not have an adverse  impact on the credit rating of the Company, any member of the Company&#8217;s  Group or of any financial indebtedness of the Company&#8217;s Group owed to any  third party in accordance with the relevant criteria of each Ratings Agency as  amended from time to time.   (B) If the relevant criteria of any Ratings Agency changes such that the treatment of  the Shareholder Loan changes adversely from a credit rating standpoint, the  Liberty Global Shareholder and the Telef&oacute;nica Shareholder shall cooperate with  the Company in a commercially reasonable manner to amend the terms of each  relevant Shareholder Loan to mitigate, to the greatest extent possible, such  adverse credit rating impact.  12.8 O2 Daisy  (A) The Company shall procure that the O2 Daisy Shareholder shall:  (i) not agree to provide any additional financing (including any O2 Daisy  Catch-up Shareholder Loan) and/or the form of such additional  financing to O2 Daisy or any other member of the O2 Daisy Group,  without the prior written consent of the Shareholders;  (ii) consult with, and have regard to the comments and suggestions of, the  Shareholders in respect of the terms of the O2 Daisy Shareholder  Loans;    79           (iii) not agree to refinance any Financial Indebtedness of the O2 Daisy  Group (including, without limitation, any of the Formation Facilities) with  third-party external debt financing without the prior written consent of  the Shareholders; and  (iv) consult with, and have regard to the comments and suggestions of, the  Shareholders in respect of the timing, terms and implementation of any  O2 Daisy External Refinancing.  13. TARGET LEVERAGE RATIO  13.1 It is the intention of the Shareholders that they manage the corporate finance structuring  and execution, credit rating, debt investor relations, hedging and covenant monitoring  activities of the Company&#8217;s Group in accordance with this clause 13.   13.2 The Shareholders agree, and the Company acknowledges, that (i) the Company's  Group shall be managed so as to maintain a Leverage Ratio of between 4.0:1 and 5.0:1  (inclusive) (the &#8220;Target Leverage Ratio&#8221;) and (ii) the Shareholders intend to cooperate  in relation to the matters set out in this clause 13.  13.3 For the purposes of this agreement, the calculation of the Leverage Ratio shall be done  on the following basis:  (A) where the relevant financial information does not include one or more members  of the Company&#8217;s Group on a consolidated basis, the financial information  available for such members of the Company&#8217;s Group on an unconsolidated  basis for that period (or part of that period) may be used to calculate the  EBITDA for the Company&#8217;s Group on a combined basis for that period (or any  part of that period);  (B) Financial Indebtedness of the Company&#8217;s Group originally denominated in any  currency other than pounds sterling that has been swapped, directly or indirectly  through one or more foreign exchange hedging transactions, into pounds  sterling, will be taken into account at its pounds sterling equivalent using the  effective exchange rate in the relevant foreign exchange hedging transactions;  (C) all the terms used in the relevant definitions are to be calculated in accordance  with the Relevant Accounting Principles;  (D) notwithstanding clauses 13.3(A) and 13.3(B) above, Non-Hedged Debt will be  taken into account at its pounds sterling equivalent calculated using the same  weighted average exchange rates for the relevant ratio period used in the profit  and loss statements of the relevant accounts of the Company&#8217;s Group for  calculating the pounds sterling equivalent of EBITDA denominated in the same  currency as the currency in which that Non-Hedged Debt is denominated or into  which it has been swapped;    80           (E) if there is any dispute on any interpretation or computation in respect of the  Leverage Ratio, the Company shall adopt the position agreed in respect of any  equivalent interpretation or computation for reporting purposes under the  Existing Liberty Global Target Group SFA;  (F) no unrealised synergies or cost savings shall be taken into account;  (G) subject to clause 13.3(F), EBITDA for the relevant period will be calculated after  giving pro forma effect to any transaction, investment, acquisition, disposition,  restructuring, corporate reorganisation or otherwise as if it occurred on the first  day of such period; and  (H) if any amendments are made by the Company to the equivalent components of  the definitions and/or interpretation clauses in the Existing Liberty Global Target  Group SFA as those set out in this agreement, this agreement shall be deemed  to be amended mutatis mutandis.  13.4 The Shareholders will procure that as part of the quarterly financial reporting package  prepared in accordance with clause 9.5 (Management accounts) in respect of a  Quarterly Accounting Period, the CFO of the Company (with advice from, and in  consultation with, the Shareholders) will calculate the Leverage Ratio as at the end of,  and with respect to, that Quarterly Accounting Period and shall give written notice of the  same, including the underlying calculations and reconciliations, to the Shareholders.  No  filing of a covenant certificate or public announcement (including any presentations of  the Leverage Ratio in any public or private offering memorandum, information  memorandum or prospectus, or in any documents or other materials provided to ratings  agencies) of the Leverage Ratio shall be made without the prior written approval of both  Shareholders.  13.5 Subject to clause 13.7 and clause 13.17, if the Leverage Ratio as at the end of a  Quarterly Accounting Period is:  (A) less than 4.0:1 and it is reasonably expected that immediately following a Type  1 Recapitalisation the Company will have sufficient distributable reserves or  Shareholder Loans to facilitate any distribution required by clause 13.11 or the  parties have agreed to distribute the proceeds of the Type 1 Recapitalisation by  way of an upstream loan from the Company to the Shareholders or by way of a  proportionate buyback of Shares by the Company, in each case, pursuant to  clause 13.11 either Shareholder shall be entitled by giving written notice to the  other and to the Company to procure the implementation by the Company of a  recapitalisation of the Company&#8217;s Group (a &#8220;Type 1 Recapitalisation&#8221;) in order  to increase the Leverage Ratio to within the Target Leverage Ratio as soon as  reasonably practicable; or  (B) subject to clause 13.6, greater than or equal to 4.0:1 but less than 5.0:1 and it is  reasonably expected that immediately following a Type 2 Recapitalisation the  Company will have sufficient distributable reserves or Shareholder Loans to  </FONT></DIV>

If either Shareholder exercises a right  to procure that the Company implement a Recapitalisation or Refinancing pursuant to  clauses 13.5 and 13.8 respectively, the other Shareholder will take all necessary steps  to procure that the Company complies with any such Recapitalisation or Refinancing (as  applicable) provided that the relevant Recapitalisation or Refinancing (as applicable) is  organised, and raised on terms that are, in accordance with the Treasury Principles. For  the avoidance of doubt, the Treasury Principles shall not apply to any financing  arrangements that are in place as at the date of this agreement.  13.10 Notwithstanding the provisions of clause 13.5 and clause 13.8 and Treasury Principle  (B), to the extent not implemented on or prior to the date of this agreement, the    82           Shareholders agree to implement a Recapitalisation as soon as practicable, taking into  account the associated costs and prevailing market conditions, after the date of this  agreement, provided that following such Recapitalisation the pro forma Net  Indebtedness of the Company&#8217;s Group does not exceed &pound;18.0 billion. The Shareholders  further agree that the base case assumption is that such Recapitalisation will be  implemented through the issue by a member of the Company&#8217;s Group of new high yield  bonds and/or loans based on terms similar to the Liberty Global Shareholder&#8217;s Group&#8217;s  existing senior secured financial indebtedness as at the date of this agreement.  The  Telef&oacute;nica Shareholder acknowledges and agrees that the entities comprising the  Telef&oacute;nica Transferred Group will, if necessary for the purposes of the Recapitalisation,  become borrowers or issuers and/or accede as guarantors and provide any required  security under the relevant financing documents at or prior to closing of such  Recapitalisation (only to the extent permitted by the terms of the financing agreements  applicable to such entities as at the relevant time).  13.11 Upon completion of a Recapitalisation and, subject to the availability of sufficient  distributable reserves or Shareholder Loans, if applicable (but without prejudice to the  Company&#8217;s obligations under clause 13.12), and applicable law and regulation  (including directors&#8217; fiduciary duties), the Company shall distribute to each Shareholder,  in proportion to its respective Percentage Interest, an amount equal to the net proceeds  from such Recapitalisation. The Company shall give notice in writing to the  Shareholders of the amount of the net proceeds available for distribution promptly  following completion of the Recapitalisation and the proposed distribution payment date.   Distributions made pursuant to this clause 13.11 shall be made by way of cash dividend  or, if the Shareholders (acting jointly and having considered the most efficient means of  making the distribution from a tax perspective) notify the Company in writing in advance,  by way of rateable repayment of principal and/or payment of any accrued interest on  any outstanding Shareholder Loans, by way of new upstream loans from the Company  to the Shareholders or by way of a proportionate buyback of Shares by the Company.  13.12 In order to enable the Company to satisfy its obligations under clause 13.11, the  Company shall use all reasonable endeavours to ensure that it is able to distribute to  each Shareholder, in proportion to its Percentage Interest, an amount equal to the net  proceeds from the Recapitalisation by upstreaming cash from members of its Group  and ensuring that it has sufficient distributable reserves to make such distributions. In  particular, it shall take such actions as the Board considers appropriate to increase the  amount of distributable reserves for any Quarterly Accounting Period where there might  otherwise be a shortfall in the amount of available distributable reserves, including by  carrying out a reduction of capital of the Company or of a subsidiary of the Company.  13.13 The Company shall, so far as it is legally able, procure that (and the Shareholders shall,  so far as they are legally able, exercise their rights in relation to the Company to procure  that) all resolutions for the declaration or payment of dividends or other distributions  consistent with this clause 13 are duly passed by the relevant members of the  Company&#8217;s Group and the Board (as applicable).    83           13.14 Each Shareholder shall procure that the Company, and shall use its reasonable  endeavours to procure that the Directors nominated by it, provide assistance to each  Shareholder in connection with a Recapitalisation or Refinancing, including by providing  access to the books and records, documents and employees of the Company and  members of its Group, and any information that a Shareholder may reasonably request  (including, where applicable, for the purposes of any public or private offering  memorandum, information memorandum or prospectus, or in any documents or other  materials provided to ratings agencies).  The parties agree that the Company shall  assist in the marketing of any debt securities including by preparing for and attending  investor and rating agency meetings.  13.15 No later than 60 Business Days prior to the end of each Accounting Period, the  Shareholders shall meet to discuss in good faith possible amendments to the Treasury  Principles that would take effect, unless the Shareholders agree otherwise, from the  start of the next Accounting Period. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Shareholders do  not agree any amendments to the Treasury Principles, the Treasury Principles shall  continue to apply.  13.16 The Company shall procure that the O2 Daisy Shareholder shall not exercise its right to  procure that O2 Daisy implement an O2 Daisy Recapitalisation pursuant to clause 13.5  (Target Leverage Ratio) of the O2 Daisy Shareholders&#8217; Agreement without the prior  written consent of the Shareholders.  13.17 The provisions of this clause 13 shall not apply during any period where (i) an IPO  Notice has been served in accordance with clause 19.1(A) and for so long as the  process following such notice has not lapsed or terminated or (ii) a ROFO Offer is  accepted by the Exiting Shareholder in accordance with clause 16.1(F) (ROFO) and for  so long as such sale does not terminate in accordance with clause 16.1(F) (ROFO).   14. RESTRICTIONS ON DEALING WITH SHARES  14.1 Restrictions on Disposals  No Disposal of any Share or Shareholder Loan shall be permitted except a transfer of  the entire legal and beneficial interest in the Share or Shareholder Loan which is  permitted by and undertaken in accordance with the other terms of this agreement.  14.2 Lock-in period  No Disposal of any Share or Shareholder Loan shall be permitted prior to the third  anniversary of the date of this agreement except in accordance with clause 14.4  (Security over Shares), clause 15.1 (Transfers to Wholly-owned Affiliates) or clause 17.3  (Call option).    84           14.3 No partial transfers  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this agreement, except in accordance with  clause 15.1 (Transfers to Wholly-owned Affiliates) and clause 19 (IPO), no Disposal of  any Share or Shareholder Loan shall be permitted unless all Shares or Shareholder  Loans held by the relevant Shareholder and members of its Group are transferred  concurrently to the same transferee.  14.4 Security over Shares  (A) Notwithstanding clause 14.1, each Shareholder shall, at any time, be permitted  to create or permit to subsist any pledge, charge, mortgage, lien or other  security interest or encumbrance (a &#8220;Relevant Security Interest&#8221;) over all (but  not some only) of the Shares held by that Shareholder or any member of its  Group in favour of one or more financial institutions in connection with any  arm&#8217;s length financing provided by such financial institution(s) to the  Shareholder&#8217;s Group (each, a &#8220;Relevant Securityholder&#8221;) provided that:  (i) all of the voting rights attaching to the Shares subject to the Relevant  Security Interest remain with the Shareholder that holds such Shares,  unless and until the Relevant Security Interest is enforced by the  Relevant Securityholder; and  (ii) each Relevant Securityholder has, at the time the Relevant Security  Interest is created, an investment grade credit rating or better by at  least one international credit rating agency.  14.5 Transfer of Shares and Shareholder Loans  Except in connection with a transfer to a Wholly-owned Affiliate pursuant to clause 15.1  (Transfers to Wholly-owned Affiliates), no Disposal of:  (A) Shares shall be permitted to any person unless all the outstanding Shareholder  Loans held by the transferring Shareholder and each member of its Group are  transferred, at par value together with an assignment of the rights to any  accrued but unpaid interest, to such person; and  (B) Shareholder Loans shall be permitted to any person unless all of the Shares  held by the transferring holder of the Shareholder Loans and each member of  its Group are transferred to such person,  and all provisions in this agreement relating to the transfer of Shares or Shareholder  Loans shall be construed accordingly.  </FONT></DIV>

(G) Notwithstanding clause 16.2(F)(i), a Drag Notice may state that:  (i) the percentage of the aggregate consideration to be satisfied by the  issue and/or transfer of Marketable Securities shall exceed 50 per cent.,  provided that:  (a) unless clause 16.2(G)(i)(b) applies, the percentage of the  aggregate consideration to be paid to the Non-Exiting  Shareholder which is to be satisfied by the issue and/or transfer  of Marketable Securities shall not exceed 50 per cent.; and  (b) the Non-Exiting Shareholder may notify the Exiting Shareholder  within 20 Business Days of delivery to it of the Drag Notice that  the Non-Exiting Shareholder elects to increase the proportion of  the aggregate consideration to be paid to it which is to be  satisfied by the issue and/or transfer of Marketable Securities  up to a maximum number of Marketable Securities as is equal  to the Non-Exiting Shareholder's Percentage Interest of the total  number of Marketable Securities offered by the Drag Sale  Offeror in consideration for all of the Shares; or    95           (ii) the consideration offered by the Drag Sale Offeror is to be satisfied part  in cash and part in securities that are not Marketable Securities (the  &quot;Non-Marketable Securities&quot;), provided that the Non-Exiting  Shareholder (unless the Non-Exiting Shareholder agrees otherwise)  receives only cash consideration of an amount which, on a per Share  basis, is equal to the value of the Non-Marketable Securities to be  issued as consideration (on a per Share basis) as at the date on which  the Exiting Shareholder executes legally binding documents to effect a  Drag Sale Offer.  (H) If all or part of the consideration for the Shares on a Drag Sale Offer comprises  Marketable Securities:  (i) the Marketable Securities shall be valued at the Marketable Security  VWAP on the date the Exiting Shareholder executes legally binding  documents to effect a Drag Sale Offer;  (ii) if the percentage of the aggregate consideration to be satisfied by the  issue and/or transfer of Marketable Securities is 50 per cent., the Non- Exiting Shareholder may elect to decrease the number of Marketable  Securities it is to be issued and/or transferred and increase the  proportion of consideration it is to receive in cash and require the  Exiting Shareholder to be issued and/or transferred such additional  number of Marketable Securities and reduce the proportion of  consideration the Exiting Shareholder is to receive in cash so that on  completion of that Drag Sale Offer, the Non-Exiting Shareholder shall  receive 40 per cent. of its consideration in Marketable Securities and  the Exiting Shareholder shall receive 60 per cent. of its consideration in  Marketable Securities;  (iii) subject to clause 16.2(I) below, the Marketable Securities shall not,  when issued and allotted or transferred to the Exiting Shareholder and  the Non-Exiting Shareholder, represent more than 25 per cent. of the  free float of the issuer of the Marketable Securities;   (iv) the Exiting Shareholder and the Non-Exiting Shareholder shall enter  into orderly marketing and lock-up arrangements on terms and  conditions for each Shareholder that are within reasonable market  parameters with the Drag Sale Offeror, each on the same terms and  conditions as are negotiated in good faith and agreed between the  Exiting Shareholder and the Drag Sale Offeror, in respect of any  Marketable Securities that either of them holds on completion of the  Drag Sale Offer; and  (v) if the Non-Exiting Shareholder would be required to obtain any  mandatory antitrust or other regulatory approval as a result of its receipt  of the Marketable Securities or if receipt of the Marketable Securities    96           would require the Non-Exiting Shareholder to make a mandatory  takeover offer to any holders of securities in the issuer of such  Marketable Securities (and such mandatory requirement cannot be  avoided by the Non-Exiting Shareholder decreasing the proportion of  the consideration to be satisfied by the issuance and allotment or  transfer of Marketable Securities), the Non-Exiting Shareholder shall be  dragged in accordance with clause 16.2(K) if the Drag Sale Offeror  offers a cash alternative to the Non-Exiting Shareholder.  (I) If the Marketable Securities shall, when issued and allotted or transferred,  represent more than 25 per cent. of the free float of the issuer of the Marketable  Securities, the Non-Exiting Shareholder shall be dragged in accordance with  clause 16.2(K) only if:   (i) the Exiting Shareholder procures that the Non-Exiting Shareholder  receives only cash consideration at the same price per Share as the  Exiting Shareholder; or  (ii) the Non-Exiting Shareholder elects to receive any Marketable Securities  as part of its consideration in connection with such Drag Sale Offer.  (J) Where the Exit Election Notice has been served by the Exiting Shareholder in  the circumstances set out in clause 16.1(H)(ii) or clause 16.1(H)(iii), in order for  the Non-Exiting Shareholder to be dragged in accordance with clause 16.2(K):  (i) the Non-Exiting Shareholder shall not be obliged to give any warranties  (other than in respect of title, capacity, authority and no insolvency) to  the Drag Sale Offeror; and  (ii) the price per Share set out in the Drag Notice must be an amount at  least the Specified Percentage greater than the fixed amount set out in  the ROFO Notice.    For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this clause 16.2(J) shall not apply  where the Exit Election Notice has been served in the circumstances set out in  clause 16.1(H)(i).  (K) If the Exiting Shareholder delivers a Drag Notice in accordance with the  provisions of clause 16.2(F), the Non-Exiting Shareholder shall be deemed to  have accepted such offer on the same terms and conditions as accepted by the  Exiting Shareholder (save as set out in the Drag Sale Terms and subject to  clauses 16.2(G), 16.2(H), 16.2(I) and 16.2(J)) and, following execution of the  definitive sale documentation by the Exiting Shareholder and the Drag Sale  Offeror (a copy of which shall be provided to the Non-Exiting Shareholder), shall  be obliged to transfer all of the Shares held by it to the Drag Sale Offeror on the  Drag Sale Terms subject to compliance with the remaining provisions of this  clause 16.2.    </FONT></DIV>

IPO  19.1 IPO Notice  (A) Either Shareholder (the &#8220;Initiating Shareholder&#8221;) may at any time following the  third anniversary of the date of this agreement serve a written notice on the  other Shareholder (the &#8220;Receiving Shareholder&#8221;) and the Company that it  wishes to pursue an initial public offering (an &quot;IPO&quot;) of the Company (an &#8220;IPO  Notice&#8221;). Following service of an IPO Notice, each Shareholder shall use all  reasonable endeavours to implement, and to procure that the Company shall  implement, an IPO in accordance with this clause 19.  Unless otherwise  permitted by this agreement, an IPO Notice may not be served if an Exit Notice  or a Group Sale Notice has been served and the process following from such  notice has not lapsed or terminated, unless the Shareholders agree to  undertake a dual track exit process, in which case the terms of this clause 19  shall apply.   (B) Within 20 Business Days of receipt of the IPO Notice by the Receiving  Shareholder and the Company, the Company, together with the Shareholders,  shall interview investment banks of international repute to act as joint global  coordinators and joint bookrunners for the IPO (the &quot;Beauty Parade&quot;).   (C) Within 30 Business Days of receipt of the IPO Notice by the Receiving  Shareholder and the Company (or, if later, five Business Days after the final  bank participating in the Beauty Parade has been interviewed), each  Shareholder shall be entitled to nominate one investment bank from the Beauty  Parade to act as a joint global coordinator and joint bookrunner for the IPO and,  following such nominations, the Company and the Shareholders shall, acting  jointly, appoint the nominated investment banks to act as joint global  coordinators and joint bookrunners for the IPO (the &#8220;Joint Global  Coordinators&#8221;).  (D) The Company may appoint an independent investment bank to act as financial  adviser to the Company in connection with the IPO (the &quot;Financial Adviser&quot;),  subject to the identity of such investment bank being approved by both  Shareholders. If the Shareholders are unable to agree, the appointment of the  Financial Adviser shall be referred to the chief executive officer of each  Shareholder's Ultimate Parent and those executives shall meet as soon as  reasonably practicable (but in any event no later than 10 Business Days after  the matter is referred to them) and use reasonable endeavours to resolve the  appointment of the Financial Adviser. If there is no resolution between the chief  executive officers, the Company shall not appoint a Financial Adviser.  (E) In addition to the Joint Global Coordinators and the Financial Adviser, the  Shareholders may, by mutual agreement, nominate any additional investment  banks of international repute to act as bookrunners and lead managers and the  Company and each Shareholder shall, acting jointly, appoint any such additional    107           investment bank to act in that capacity as soon as reasonably practicable after  such nomination.   (F) The terms of appointment of the Joint Global Coordinators, the Financial  Adviser and any other bookrunners and lead managers shall provide that, save  as may otherwise be agreed by the Shareholders, the Company shall pay the  fees, commissions and expenses of the Joint Global Coordinators, the Financial  Adviser, any bookrunners and lead managers and any Company Advisers (as  applicable) in connection with the IPO, other than any underwriting commission  on the sale of any Shares in the IPO which shall be paid by the Shareholder(s)  in proportion to the number of Shares sold pursuant to the IPO.  (G) The Company shall, following consultation with the Initiating Shareholder and  the Receiving Shareholder, appoint, at its own cost, external legal counsel,  reporting accountants and other advisers as and when may reasonably be  required in order to facilitate a successful IPO (including, but not limited to,  advising on the appropriate existing entity in the Company's Group or a newly  incorporated entity to be listed pursuant to the proposed IPO and the jurisdiction  of incorporation and tax domicile of such entity) (together, the &quot;Company  Advisers&quot;).     (H) Following the appointment of the Joint Global Coordinators, the Shareholders  and the Company undertake to each other to work together in good faith with  the Joint Global Coordinators in connection with the proposed IPO for the  duration of the IPO process, including, but not limited to, working together with  the Joint Global Coordinators in good faith so that the Joint Global Coordinators  can make recommendations, subject always to the Pre-Agreed Parameters, as  to (i) the Secondary IPO Venue (if required in accordance with clause 19.2(A)),  (ii) the offer structure of the IPO, (iii) the equity story, (iv) optimal execution  market windows, (v) capital structure and distribution policies, (vi) the  governance structure of the IPO entity, and (vii) the price range and the offer  size for an IPO (the &quot;JGC Recommendations&quot;).    (I) The Shareholders agree that any IPO shall be implemented in accordance with  the priorities set out below (the &#8220;IPO Principles&#8221;), and the Joint Global  Coordinators shall be instructed that, when making the JGC Recommendations,  they must take into account the Pre-Agreed Parameters (as defined below) and  the intention of the Shareholders to achieve a successful IPO in accordance  with the IPO Principles as follows:   (i) maximising the valuation per Share of the Shares to be sold in the IPO  (as the first priority);  (ii) ensuring a good after-market performance of the listed Shares post-IPO  with good liquidity levels consistent with IPOs of a similar nature (as the  second priority); and    108           (iii) achieving a sale of the greatest possible number of Shares in the IPO  (as the third priority), subject to any maximum number offered for sale  by the Shareholders.  (J) If the Joint Global Coordinators cannot agree on any JGC Recommendation in  connection with the IPO, the Initiating Shareholder shall decide which of the  Joint Global Coordinator's recommendations shall take precedence.   (K) Without prejudice to the Initiating Shareholder&#8217;s obligation to serve an IPO Tag  Notice in accordance with clause 19.1(L), the Receiving Shareholder may at  any time following service of an IPO Notice up until the receipt of the IPO Tag  Notice give written notice to the Initiating Shareholder and to the Company that  it wishes to participate in the IPO on a joint basis with the Initiating Shareholder.  (L) No later than 30 Business Days ahead of any &quot;expected intention to float  announcement&quot; in the case of an IPO on the Preferred IPO Venue or equivalent  stage of the process for an IPO on a Secondary IPO Venue, the Initiating  Shareholder shall serve an &#8220;IPO Tag Notice&#8221; on the Receiving Shareholder,  such notice to include details of the number of Shares proposed to be offered  for sale by the Initiating Shareholder pursuant to the IPO, an indicative price  range for the IPO, the number of Shares that the Joint Global Coordinators  recommend can be sold in the IPO, the indicative price range for the IPO  recommended by the Joint Global Coordinators and details of the offer structure  of the IPO, the equity story, the optimal execution market window(s), capital  structure and capital allocation policies and confirmation that the terms of the  IPO will be in accordance with the Pre-Agreed Parameters.  Following receipt of  the IPO Tag Notice, the Receiving Shareholder shall have the option,  exercisable until 10 Business Days before the proposed date of any &quot;intention  to float&quot; announcement (or its equivalent in any jurisdiction) in connection with a  possible IPO, by giving written notice to the Initiating Shareholder, to participate  in the sale of its Shares pursuant to the IPO (the &quot;IPO Option&quot;).  (M) If the Receiving Shareholder exercises the IPO Option or gives notice under  clause 19.1(K):   (i) the number of shares that the Initiating Shareholder may offer for sale  shall be reduced to such extent required to allow the Receiving  Shareholder to be able to sell up to the number of Shares held by it  equivalent to its Percentage Interest multiplied by the number of Shares  to be offered for sale pursuant to the IPO as determined in accordance  with clause 19.1(M)(iv);  (ii) without prejudice to clause 19.2, the Shareholders and the Company  shall proceed with the IPO and the Shareholders shall agree, taking into  account the JGC Recommendations, the terms of the IPO, save that if  the Shareholders are unable to agree on the terms of the IPO, the  Initiating Shareholder shall decide the terms of the IPO;   </FONT></DIV>

(C) If the Pre-Agreed Parameters cannot be satisfied on the Preferred IPO Venue  or on the Secondary IPO Venues, the Shareholders shall discuss in good faith  any necessary amendments to the Pre-Agreed Parameters.

The  relevant Group Company shall keep the relevant Shareholder informed as to  the content of all relevant correspondence and discussions with HMRC.  (E) If and to the extent that it is determined that Eligible Losses purported to be  surrendered pursuant to clause 25.27(A) are not permitted by law to be  surrendered or group relief in relation thereto is not permitted by law to be  claimed, then the aggregate amount of the payments referred to in clause  25.27(C)(iii) and clause 25.27(C)(iv) to the Shareholder (or the member of its  Group) making the surrender shall be adjusted so that the aggregate amount of  those payments is the amount which would have been paid had it been known  that such Eligible Losses were not permitted by law to be surrendered or group  relief in relation thereto was not permitted by law to be claimed, and the  Shareholders and the Company shall make (or, where the surrendering  company is a member of a Shareholder's Group and not a Shareholder, that  Shareholder shall procure that such member of its Group makes) (or, where the  claimant company is a Group Company other than the Company, the Company  shall procure that such Group Company makes) any appropriate payments  required to achieve that position.  25.28 In clauses 25.26 to 25.28 (Consortium Relief):   (A) where an accounting period of a company falls partly within one financial year  and partly within another financial year, the corporation tax rate in force for that  accounting period shall be taken to be the average of the corporation tax rates  in force in such financial years applied on a time basis according to the  respective lengths of the parts of the accounting period which fall in such  financial years; and  (B) references to the &quot;corporation tax rate&quot; are references to the rate of corporation  tax on profits of companies (other than &quot;ring fence profits&quot; within the meaning of  Part 8 of CTA 2010).  25.29 Corporate Interest Restriction   (A) Each Shareholder agrees that they share the intention that the Group  Companies will form a &quot;worldwide group&quot; of which the Company is the &quot;ultimate  parent&quot; (such terms defined for the purposes of this clause as they are for the  purposes of section 473 TIOPA).

(C) With respect to each Guarantor, this guarantee is to be a continuing guarantee  and accordingly is to remain in force until all the obligations of the relevant  Breaching Shareholder shall have been performed or satisfied.

Banks will be chosen based on relevant  criteria including current risk profile, remuneration received from the Company's  Group in the preceding 24 month period, level of exposure to the Company, the  information presented at the beauty parade and on the basis of their market  status for the particular debt services and products sought (and in making the  decision to choose the banks the Shareholder(s) shall act reasonably).   (B) In the case of Recapitalisations, the Leverage Ratio shall be increased as close  as possible to 5.0:1, provided that the Leverage Ratio shall not exceed 4.99:1  immediately following completion of the Recapitalisation and shall not (as  determined by reference to the Business Plan in place at the time of  implementing the Recapitalisation) exceed 4.99:1 at the end of each quarter of  the 12 month period following completion of the Recapitalisation.   (C) The Recapitalisation or Refinancing shall not be implemented in respect of an  amount less than the prevailing market standard minimum tranche size unless  such new debt is being added to an existing debt tranche.
