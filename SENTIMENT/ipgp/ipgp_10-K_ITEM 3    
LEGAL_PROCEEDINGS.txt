LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
From time to time, we are party to various legal claims and legal proceedings and other disputes incidental to our business, such as employment, intellectual property or product issues. For a discussion of the risks associated with such matters, see Item 1A. "
Risk Factors — We are subject to litigation alleging that we infringe third-party intellectual property rights. Intellectual property claims could result in costly litigation and harm our business.
" and "
Risk Factors — We must comply with and could be impacted by various export controls and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations that could negatively affect our business and may change due to diplomatic and political considerations outside of our control."
In December 2024, affiliates of Trumpf SE & Co. KG (“Trumpf”) filed patent lawsuits in two different Unified Patent Courts located in Germany against IPG Laser GmbH & Co. KG alleging infringement of two patents granted by the European Patent Office by our adjustable mode beam (AMB) lasers. Our AMB lasers are used in the welding of electric vehicle batteries as well as structural welding.  The matter is still in its early stages and we intend to defend it vigorously.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors including, but not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A, "Risk Factors." The following analysis generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024.
Overview 
We develop, manufacture and sell high-performance fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers, diode lasers and laser-based systems that are used for diverse applications, primarily in materials processing, medical and advanced applications. We also manufacture and sell complementary products used with our lasers including optical delivery cables, fiber couplers, beam switches, optical processing heads, in-line sensors and chillers. We sell our products globally to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs"), system integrators and end users. We market our products internationally, primarily through our

direct sales force. Our major manufacturing facilities are located in the United States and Germany. In response to the risks from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and related sanctions, we have ceased new investment in our Belarusian operations and expanded our manufacturing operations in Germany, the United States and Italy, and have added manufacturing capacity in Poland to meet the demand for our products and our sales and support needs. We have sales and service offices and applications laboratories worldwide.
We are vertically integrated such that we design and manufacture most of the key components used in our finished products, from semiconductor diodes to optical fiber preforms, finished fiber lasers and complementary products. Our vertically integrated operations allow us to reduce manufacturing costs, control quality, rapidly develop and integrate advanced products and protect our proprietary technology.
Description of Our Net Sales, Costs and Expenses
Net sales.
 We derive net sales primarily from the sale of fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers, diode lasers, laser and non-laser based systems and complementary products. We sell our products to OEMs that supply materials processing laser systems, medical laser systems and other laser systems to end users. We also sell our laser products and laser and non-laser based systems to end users. Our scientists and engineers work closely with OEMs, systems integrators and end users to analyze their system requirements and match appropriate fiber laser, amplifier or system specifications to those requirements. Our sales cycle varies substantially, ranging from a period of a few weeks to as long as one year or more, but is typically several months.

Sales of our products are generally recognized upon shipment, provided that no obligations remain and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured. Sales of customized large scale material processing systems are recognized over time. Our sales typically are made on a purchase order basis rather than through long-term purchase commitments. 
We develop our products to standard specifications and use a common set of components within our product architectures. Our major products are based upon a common technology platform. We continually enhance these and other products by improving their components and developing new components and new product designs.
Cost of sales.
 Our cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of raw materials and components, direct labor expenses and manufacturing overhead. We are vertically integrated and currently manufacture all critical components for our products as well as assemble finished products. We believe our vertical integration allows us to increase efficiencies, leverage our scale and lower our cost of sales. Cost of sales also includes personnel costs and overhead related to our manufacturing, engineering and service operations, related occupancy and equipment costs, shipping costs and reserves for inventory obsolescence and for warranty obligations. Inventories are written off and charged to cost of sales when identified as excess or obsolete.
Due to our vertical integration strategy and ongoing investment in plant and machinery, we maintain a relatively high fixed manufacturing overhead. We may not be able to or choose not to adjust these fixed costs to adapt to rapidly changing market conditions. Our gross margin is therefore significantly affected by our sales volume and the corresponding utilization of capacity and absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses.
Sales and marketing.
 Our sales and marketing expense consists primarily of costs related to compensation, trade shows, professional and technical conferences, travel, facilities, amortization of intangible assets identified from acquisitions, depreciation of equipment used for demonstration purposes and other marketing costs.
Research and development.
 Our research and development expense consists primarily of compensation, development expenses related to the design of our products and certain components, the cost of materials and components to build prototype devices for testing, facilities costs and depreciation of equipment and facilities that have an alternative future use used for research and development purposes. Costs related to product development are recorded as research and development expenses in the period in which they are incurred. 
General and administrative.
 Our general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, legal, human resources, information technology and other administrative personnel, outside legal and professional fees, insurance premiums and fees, allocated facilities costs, depreciation of facilities and other corporate expenses such as charges and benefits related to the change in allowance for credit losses.
Factors and Trends That Affect Our Operations and Financial Results
In reading our financial statements, you should be aware of the following factors and trends that our management believes are important in understanding our financial performance. 
Sale of our Russian Operations. 
On August 29, 2024, we completed the sale of our Russian subsidiary, Scientific and Technical Association “IRE-Polus”, pursuant to a share purchase agreement with a purchaser entity associated with Softline 
31
Table of Contents
Projects LLC and existing management of IRE-Polus for $51.1 million. We recorded a loss on divestiture of $197.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which was included in Net loss (gain) from divestiture and sale of assets in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The loss included $59.3 million related to the carrying value of net assets of our Russian subsidiary that was in excess of net proceeds received on the sale. Included in the net assets sold was cash and cash equivalents of $74.0 million. Also included in the loss was $135.3 million related to the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive loss that was previously included in stockholders' equity of our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and related sanctions, our ability to ship and receive components from our Russian operations was significantly curtailed. In response, we expanded our manufacturing capacity in Germany, the United States and Italy, and added new manufacturing capacity in Poland which effectively offset our inability to utilize the Russian operations.
Belarusian Operations.
 We manufacture laser cabinets and other mechanical components in Belarus. In response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the EU issued additional sanctions impacting commerce with Belarus on June 29, 2024, which restricted the supply of laser cabinets and other mechanical components from our factory in Belarus to our Germany operations after October 2, 2024. As a result of the sanctions and their impact on our Belarus operations, we completed an impairment analysis of our Belarus assets during the third quarter of 2024 and recorded $26.6 million of impairment of long-lived asset in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December 31, 2024, the remaining value of the long-lived assets in Belarus was $3.8 million, net working capital excluding cash was immaterial and cash was $4.7 million. The net asset value of our Belarus subsidiary has been reduced by $18.6 million due to the cumulative translation effect of the Belarusian ruble compared to the U.S. dollar, which is included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of stockholders' equity. We may incur additional asset impairment charges related to the Belarus operations and the other comprehensive loss that is currently in the equity section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets could be charged to our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
We continue to review our operations in Belarus including potential strategic alternatives. We have qualified third party vendors to supply components previously supplied from Belarus and have begun purchasing from them. Our Board of Directors monitors and continues to assess risks associated with our Belarusian operations.
Supply Chain
.  We experienced supply chain issues related to the Covid epidemic and related to sanctions that affected the flow of goods to and from our factories in Russia and Belarus. These issues caused us to maintain higher levels of inventory in order to minimize the risk of disruption in production. While these supply chain issues are no longer having a significant impact on our operations, we have experienced increases in our provisions for excess and obsolete inventory as a result of higher inventory levels. In 2024, we recorded additional inventory provisions of $29.5 million attributed to items previously considered safety stock and items that became technologically obsolete.
Net sales.
  Net sales decreased by 24% in 2024, decreased by 10% in 2023 and decreased 2% in 2022. Our growth rates are subject to several factors, many of which are not under our control.
Our business depends substantially upon capital expenditures by end users, particularly by manufacturers using our products for materials processing, which includes general manufacturing, automotive including electric vehicles ("EV"), other transportation, aerospace, heavy industry, consumer, semiconductor and electronics. Approximately 88% of our revenues in 2024 were from customers using our products for materials processing. Although applications within materials processing are broad, the capital equipment market in general is cyclical and historically has experienced sudden and severe downturns. For the foreseeable future, our operations will continue to depend upon capital expenditures by end users of materials processing equipment and will be subject to the broader fluctuations of capital equipment spending.
In recent years, our net sales and margins have been negatively impacted by tariffs and trade policy. New tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments. We are also susceptible to global or regional disruptions such as political instability, geopolitical conflicts, acts of terrorism, significant fluctuations in currency values, natural disasters and pandemics to the extent that they affect macroeconomic conditions, global supply chains or individual IPG locations.
The average selling prices of our products generally decrease as the products mature. These decreases result from factors such as increased competition, decreased manufacturing costs and increased unit volumes. We may also reduce selling prices in order to penetrate new markets and applications. Furthermore, we may negotiate discounted selling prices from time to time with certain customers that place high unit-volume orders.
The secular shift to fiber laser technology in large materials processing applications, such as welding and cutting applications, had a positive effect on our sales trends in the past such that our sales trends were often better than other capital equipment manufacturers in both positive and negative economic cycles. As the secular shift to fiber laser technology matures in such applications, our sales trends are more susceptible to economic cycles, which can broadly affect the demand for capital 
32
Table of Contents
equipment including machine tools and industrial lasers, and competition from other fiber laser manufacturers. Additionally, as our technology matures, we become subject to more competition which can affect sales trends.
Gross margin.
 Our total gross margin in any period can be significantly affected by a number of factors, including net sales, production volumes, competitive factors, product mix, and by other factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. Many of these factors are not under our control. The following are examples of factors affecting gross margin: 
•
As our products mature, we can experience additional competition, which tends to decrease average selling prices and affects gross margin;
•
Our gross margin can be significantly affected by product mix. Within each of our product categories, the gross margin is generally higher for devices with greater average power, higher technical complexity or demanding performance parameters. These higher power products often have better performance, more difficult specifications to attain and fewer competing products in the marketplace;
•
Higher power lasers also use a greater number of optical components, improving absorption of fixed overhead costs and enabling economies of scale in manufacturing;
•
The gross margin for certain specialty products may be higher because there are fewer or sometimes no equivalent competing products;
•
Customers that purchase devices in greater unit volumes generally are provided lower prices per device than customers that purchase fewer units. In general, lower selling prices to high unit volume customers reduce gross margin although this may be partially offset by improved absorption of fixed overhead costs associated with larger product volumes, which drive economies of scale;
•
Gross margin on systems can be lower than gross margin for our lasers and sub-systems, depending on the configuration, volume and competitive forces, among other factors;
•
Persistent inflation leading to increases in average manufacturing salaries as well as an increase in the purchase price of components including, but not limited to, electronic components and metal parts could negatively impact gross margin if we are not able to pass those increases on to customers by increasing the selling price of our products;
•
Changes in relative exchange rates between currencies we receive when selling our products and currencies we use to pay our manufacturing expenses; and finally,
•
Our gross margin from products on new manufacturing lines can be lower due to production inefficiencies, lower yields and high scrap costs.
We expect that some new technologies, products and systems will have returns above our cost of capital but may have gross margins below our corporate average. If we are able to develop opportunities that are significant in size, competitively advantageous or leverage our existing technology base and leadership, our current gross margin levels may not be maintained. Instead, we aim to deliver industry-leading levels of gross margins by growing sales, by taking market share in existing markets, or by developing new applications and markets we address, by reducing the cost of our products and by optimizing the efficiency of our manufacturing operations.
We invested $98.5 million, $110.5 million and $110.1 million in capital expenditures in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Most of this investment relates to expansion of our manufacturing capacity and, to a lesser extent, research and development and sales-related facilities. We received $28.6 million, $31.2 million and $26.9 million in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
A high proportion of our costs is fixed so costs are generally difficult to adjust or may take time to adjust in response to changes in demand. In addition, our fixed costs increase as we expand our capacity. If we expand capacity faster than is required by sales growth, gross margins could be negatively affected. Gross margins generally decline if production volumes are lower as a result of a decrease in sales or a reduction in inventory because the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs will be reduced. Gross margins generally improve when the opposite occurs. If both sales and inventory decrease in the same period, the decline in gross margin may be greater if we cannot reduce fixed costs or choose not to reduce fixed costs to match the decrease in the level of production. If we experience a decline in sales that reduces absorption of our fixed costs, or if we have production issues, our gross margins will be negatively affected.
33
Table of Contents
We also regularly review our inventory for items that are slow-moving, have been rendered obsolete or are determined to be excess. Any provision for such slow-moving, obsolete or excess inventory affects our gross margins. For example, we recorded provisions for slow-moving, obsolete or excess inventory and other inventory related charges totaling $82.5 million, $45.5 million and $128.0 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Inventory provisions of $29.5 million in 2024 were attributed to items previously considered safety stock and items that became technologically obsolete. Inventory provision and related charges of $74.1 million in 2022 were attributable to Russian operations.
Selling and general and administrative expenses. 
In the past, we invested in selling and general and administrative costs in order to support continued growth in the Company. As the secular shift to fiber laser technology matures, our sales growth becomes more susceptible to the cyclical trends typical of capital equipment manufacturers. Accordingly, our future management of and investments in selling and general and administrative expenses will also be influenced by these trends, although we may still invest in selling or general and administrative functions to support certain initiatives even in economic down cycles. Certain general and administrative expenses are not related to the level of sales and may vary quarter to quarter based primarily upon the level of acquisitions, litigation and project related consulting expenses.
Research and development expenses. 
We plan to continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing components and products and develop new components, products, systems and applications technology. We believe that these investments will sustain our position as a leader in the fiber laser industry and will support development of new products that can address new markets and growth opportunities. The amount of research and development expense we incur may vary from period to period.
Goodwill and long-lived assets impairments
. We review our intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Negative industry or economic trends, including reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates, lack of growth in our relevant business units, differences in the estimated product acceptance rates, or market prices below the carrying value of long-lived assets evaluated for sale could lead to impairment charges against our long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets.
As noted above, we recorded $26.6 million impairment of long-lived assets included in Impairment of long-lived assets in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. After impairment, the remaining carrying value of the long-lived assets in Belarus is $3.8 million.
Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make significant judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance at many points during the analysis. Also, the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective. We operate in a highly competitive environment and projections of future operating results and cash flows may vary significantly from actual results. If our analysis indicates potential impairment to goodwill in one or more of our reporting units, we may be required to record charges to earnings in our financial statements, which could negatively affect our results of operations.
Foreign exchange.
 Because we are a U.S.-based company doing business globally, we have both translational and transactional exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in the relative exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the foreign currencies in which our subsidiaries operate directly affects our sales, costs and earnings. Differences in the relative exchange rates between where we sell our products and where we incur manufacturing and other operating costs (primarily in the U.S. and Germany) also affects our costs and earnings. Certain currencies experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations like the euro, the Russian ruble, the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen have had and could have an additional significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. Our ability to adjust the foreign currency selling prices of products in response to changes in exchange rates is limited and may not offset the impact of the changes in exchange rates on the translated value of sales or costs. In addition, if we increase the selling price of our products in local currencies, this could have a negative impact on the demand for our products.
Income taxes. 
On December 15, 2022, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. The EU effective dates were January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, for different aspects of the directive. The impact of the Pillar Two Framework on our income tax provision in 2024 was not material. We are continuing to evaluate the potential impact of the Pillar Two Framework on future periods, pending legislative adoption by additional individual countries.
Major customers.
 While we have historically depended on a few customers for a large percentage of our annual net sales, the composition of this group can change from year to year. Net sales derived from our five largest customers as a percentage of our annual net sales were 13%, 13% and 15% in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. One of our customers accounted for 12% and 14% of our net accounts receivable as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

We seek to add new customers and to 
34
Table of Contents
expand our relationships with existing customers. We anticipate that the composition of our significant customers will continue to change. We generally do not enter into agreements with our customers obligating them to purchase a fixed number or large volume of our products. If any of our significant customers substantially reduced their purchases from us, our results would be adversely affected.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses. Refer to Note 1, "Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies," in our consolidated financial statements for additional information. By their nature, these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates, which may materially affect our operating results and financial position. We have identified the following items that require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimation:
Revenue Recognition. 
Revenue is recognized when transfer of control to the customer occurs (i.e., when our performance obligation is satisfied) in an amount reflecting the consideration that we expect to be entitled. For the majority of our revenue, this typically occurs at a point in time such as shipment or delivery date, but can occur over time for certain of our customized large scale materials processing systems contracts. We also recognize revenue over time for sales of extended warranties. When goods or services have been delivered to the customer, but all conditions for revenue recognition have not been met, deferred revenue and deferred costs are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Judgments and Uncertainties:
 Recognizing revenue at shipment or delivery involves some judgment, particularly when we receive orders with multiple delivery dates. We allocate the transaction price of the contract to each delivery date based upon the standalone selling price of each distinct product in the contract. We invoice for each scheduled delivery upon shipment and recognize revenue for such delivery when transfer of control has occurred. Recognizing revenue over time for customized large scale materials processing systems contracts is based on our judgment that these systems do not have an alternative use and we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. Recognizing revenue over time also requires estimation of the progress towards completion based on the projected costs of the contract.
Sensitivity of Estimate to Change:
 Recognizing revenue at a point in time is sensitive to changes in shipping or delivery dates. Revenue recognition over time is sensitive to the actual costs incurred as compared to the projected total cost of the project. We monitor the actual and projected costs of these contracts closely. A change in the projected cost of a project will affect the estimated percentage of completion, the amount of revenue recognized and estimated gross margin.
Inventory. 
We maintain a reserve for excess or obsolete inventory items. The reserve is based upon a review of inventory materials on hand, which we compare with historic usage, estimated future usage and age. In addition, we review the inventory and compare recorded costs with estimates of current market value. Write-downs are recorded to reduce the carrying value to the net realizable value with respect to any part with costs in excess of current market value. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we performed a review of the inventory in Russia in light of new sanctions which restricted our Russian factory's ability to supply components and finished goods to other IPG locations. We recorded $74.1 million of additional inventory provision and related charges as a result of that review in 2022. In the third quarter of 2024, we recorded $29.5 million of additional inventory provision that was attributed to items previously considered safety stock and items that became technologically obsolete. 
Judgments and Uncertainties:
 Estimating demand and current market values is inherently difficult, particularly given that we make highly specialized components and products. We determine the valuation of excess and obsolete inventory by making our best estimate considering the current quantities of inventory on hand and our forecast of the need for this inventory to support future sales of our products. We often have limited information on which to base our forecasts. If future sales differ from these forecasts, the valuation of excess and obsolete inventory may change and additional inventory provisions may be required. 
Sensitivity of Estimate to Change:
 Because of our vertical integration, a significant or sudden decrease in sales could result in a significant change in the estimates of excess or obsolete inventory valuation. Because our calculation of slow-moving, excess or obsolete inventory is based on historical and estimated future use of inventory items, the calculation is affected by sales trends.  In 2024, we recorded inventory provision of $29.5 million for items previously considered safety stock and items that became technologically obsolete. In 2023, as sales decreased the inventory provision related to slow-moving, excess or obsolete inventory increased. In 2022, we recorded inventory provision and related charges of $74.1 million as a 
35
Table of Contents
result of the review of the inventory in Russia. For the rest of our operations, as safety stock increased excess and obsolete inventory reserves increased during 2022.
Long-lived Asset Impairment. 
Long-lived assets including definite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. We review these assets for impairment when conditions exist that indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such conditions could include significant adverse changes in the business climate, current-period operating or cash flow losses, significant declines in forecasted operations, or a current expectation that an asset group will be disposed of before the end of its useful life. We perform undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists. When testing for impairment of long-lived assets held for use, we group assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss is calculated based on estimated fair value based on a probability-weighted average of valuations using the discounted cash flow method under the income approach. We recorded long-lived asset impairment charge of $27.0 million, $1.2 million, and $79.9 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Impairment charges in 2022 and 2024 primarily related to the impairment of our Russian and Belarus long-lived assets, respectively, as a result of new sanctions that impacted our business there.
Judgments and Uncertainties:
 Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make significant judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and to rely heavily on projections of future operating performance at many points during the analysis. Estimating undiscounted operating cash flow used to determine if there is indication of impairment of a long-lived asset requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding our future plans, as well as industry, economic, and regulatory conditions. Fair value estimates performed to determine impairment charge amounts are subject to underlying changes in estimates and market conditions. Assumptions used in long-lived asset impairment are made at a point in time and require significant judgment; therefore, they are subject to change based on the facts and circumstances present at each impairment test date. 
Sensitivity of Estimate to Change:
 Undiscounted cash flows and fair value are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions, estimates, and market factors. Negative industry or economic trends, including reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates, lack of growth in our relevant business units, differences in the estimated product acceptance rates, or market prices below the carrying value of long-lived assets evaluated for sale could lead to impairment charges against our long-lived assets. 
Income Taxes and Deferred Taxes
. Our annual tax rate is based on the income generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate, the statutory tax rates in those jurisdictions and tax planning opportunities available to the Company.  We file federal and state income tax returns in the United States and income tax returns in all the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. 
Judgments and Uncertainties:
 We estimate our income tax expense in each jurisdiction we operate in after considering, among other factors, the pricing of inter-company transactions on an arm’s length basis, the differing tax rates between jurisdictions, allocation factors, tax credits, nondeductible items and changes in enacted tax rates. Significant judgment is required in determining the pricing of inter-company transactions, our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.  As we continue to expand globally, there is a risk that, due to complexity within and diversity among the various jurisdictions in which we do business, a governmental agency may disagree with the manner in which we have computed our taxes.  Additionally, due to the lack of uniformity among all of the foreign and domestic taxing authorities, there may be situations where the tax treatment of an item in one jurisdiction is different from the tax treatment in another jurisdiction or that the transaction causes a tax liability to arise in another jurisdiction.
In addition, we review the deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction and the positive and negative evidence that would support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is or is not needed.  Where it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets. The decision to establish a valuation allowance or reverse it is based on management’s judgment based on the weight of available evidence including forecasts of future taxable income and the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences.
Sensitivity of Estimate to Change:
 We provide reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other issues. Reserves recorded are based on a determination of tax benefits claimed in our tax filings and whether these positions are more likely than not to be realized following the resolution of any potential tax audits related to the tax benefit, assuming that the matter in question will be reviewed by the tax authorities. Potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions are recorded as a component of income tax expense. As of December 31, 2024, we had $13.9 million of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, recorded in other long-term liabilities and deferred income taxes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. This tax liability increased by $0.2 million for tax positions taken in the current year offset by reductions of $3.4 million for changes in prior period positions.

Materials
 Processing
Sales for materials processing applications decreased primarily due to lower sales of high power CW lasers, pulsed lasers, and other laser products and services. 
•
High power CW laser sales decreased due to lower sales for cutting and welding applications, and were primarily impacted by softer industrial demand and a decrease in e-mobility investments. Pulsed laser sales decreased due to lower demand in foil cutting and micro-machining applications.
Other Applications
Sales from other applications decreased primarily due to decreased demand for lasers used in medical procedures. 
Our net sales were derived from customers in the following geographic regions:

The substantial majority of sales in North America are to customers in the United States.
Cost of sales and gross margin.
 Cost of sales decreased by $106.7 million, or 14.3%, to $639.0 million in 2024 from $745.7 million in 2023. Our gross margin decreased to 34.6% in 2024 from 42.1% in 2023. Gross margin decreased mainly due to increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, specifically additional inventory provisions of $29.5 million attributed to items previously considered safety stock and items that became technologically obsolete. In addition to provisions for inventory reserves, gross margin declined due to an increase in unabsorbed manufacturing costs, partially offset by a decrease in cost of product sold from inventory and shipping costs and tariffs, as a percentage of sales. Expenses related to provisions for excess or obsolete inventory and other valuation adjustments increased by $37.0 million to $82.5 million, or

Table of Contents
8.4% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $45.5 million, or 3.5% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
Sales and marketing expense.
 Sales and marketing expense increased by $3.9 million, or 4.6%, to $89.6 million in 2024 from $85.7 million in 2023. This change was primarily a result of an increase of $3.5 million in personnel and related costs and $2.3 million in premises expense, partially offset by $2.2 million in lower depreciation and amortization expense. As a percentage of sales, sales and marketing expense was 9.2% and 6.7% of sales in 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Research and development expense. 
Research and development expense increased by $11.1 million, or 11.2%, to $109.8 million in 2024 from $98.7 million in 2023. This change was primarily a result of an increase of $8.3 million in personnel and related costs, an increase of $5.8 million in premises expense, partially offset by a decrease of $3.6 million in materials and other R&D expense. As a percentage of sales, research and development expense increased to 11.2% in 2024 from 7.7% in 2023. We expect to continue to invest in research and development efforts for new and continuing products.  
General and administrative expense.
 General and administrative expense decreased by $1.4 million, or 1.1%, to $124.3 million in 2024 from $125.7 million in 2023. This change was primarily a result of a decrease of $3.8 million in personnel and related costs, partially offset by an increase of $1.0 million in legal, $0.8 million in information systems, and $0.6 million in accounting expense. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expense increased to 12.7% in 2024 from 9.8% in 2023. 
Effect of exchange rates on sales, gross margin and operating expenses. 
We estimate that if exchange rates had been the same as one year ago, sales in 2024 would have been $15.6 million higher, gross margin would have been $9.2 million higher and sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses would have been $3.8 million higher. These estimates assume constant exchange rates between fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2023 and are calculated using the average exchange rates for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2023 for the respective currencies, which were US$1=Euro 0.92, US$1=Japanese yen 141, US$1=Chinese yuan 7.08 and US$1=Russian ruble 85.
Net loss (gain) from divestiture and sale of assets. 
We incurred a net loss of $190.2 million in 2024 as compared to no loss or gain in 2023. The loss primarily related to a loss of $197.7 million upon the divestiture of our Russian operations, partially offset by a gain on sale of assets of $7.5 million related to the sales of a building and land in the U.S. and a building in the U.K.
Impairment of long-lived assets.  
We recorded a non-cash long-lived asset impairment charge of $27.0 million in 2024 as compared to $1.2 million in 2023. The impairment of long-lived assets in 2024 was primarily related to an impairment of the assets in Belarus of $26.6 million as a result of new EU sanctions that will limit our ability to supply laser cabinets and other mechanical components from our factory in Belarus. The impairment of long-lived assets in 2023 was related to the right-of-use ("ROU") asset for a leased building associated with our Submarine Network Division business that was previously divested. Attempts to sublease the space have been unsuccessful. As of December 31, 2023, the ROU asset related to this lease has been reduced to zero. 
Restructuring charges (recoveries), net.
  We recorded no restructuring charges nor recoveries in 2024 as compared to a net restructuring gain of $0.3 million in 2023 primarily related to the completion of our restructuring program at our Russian subsidiary. 
Loss (gain) on foreign exchange.
 We incurred a foreign exchange loss of $5.5 million in 2024 as compared to a gain of $1.4 million in 2023. The losses in 2024 was primarily attributable to depreciation of the Chinese yuan and Korean won, partially offset by the gain from depreciation of the Euro, as compared to the U.S. dollar.
Interest income, net.
 Interest income, net was $45.5 million in 2024 compared to $41.7 million in 2023. The change in interest income, net, was driven by an increase in yields on cash equivalents and short term investments as a result of higher market interest rates as compared to prior year rates.
Provision for income taxes.
 Provision for income taxes was $19.6 million in 2024 compared to $56.0 million in 2023, representing an effective tax rate of (12.1)% in 2024 and 20.4% in 2023. The decrease in tax expense was due primarily to a reduction in taxable income. In 2024 we had tax expense on a loss before income due to the effect of discrete items. Total discrete adjustments in 2024 increased tax expense by $46.0 million. Discrete items include an increase in tax expense of $43.2 million related the loss on divestiture of Russian operations that had no tax benefit. Other discrete items for 2024 included a $3.2 million benefit related to a decrease in uncertain tax positions and the results of tax audits. This benefit was offset by an increase in tax expense of $5.4 million for equity-based compensation deductions reflected in book income in excess of the deductions allowed for tax purposes. Discrete adjustments in 2023 resulted in a $5.7 million decrease in tax expense, which includes (i) $4.3 million decrease in the valuation allowance primarily due to current year profits in our Russian subsidiary and

(ii) $3.5 million related to a decrease in uncertain tax positions and the results of tax audits. These benefits were partly offset by an increase in tax expense of $1.8 million for equity-based compensation deductions reflected in book income in excess of the deductions allowed for tax purposes.  
Net (loss) income attributed to IPG Photonics Corporation.
 Net (loss) income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation decreased by $400.4 million to a net loss of $181.5 million in 2024 from a net income of $218.9 million in 2023. Net loss attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation as a percentage of our net sales decreased by 35.6% to (18.6)% in 2024 from 17.0% in 2023 due to the factors described above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, our cash flows from operations and our existing lines of credit provide us with the financial flexibility to meet our liquidity and capital needs. We expect to continue making investments in capital expenditures, assess acquisition opportunities, carry out research and development and investment in resources to strengthen our organization. The extent and timing of such expenditures may vary from period to period. Our future long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors including our level of sales, the impact of the economic environment on our growth, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, expansion of global sales and marketing activities, government regulation including trade sanctions, the timing and introductions of new products, the need to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the market acceptance of our current and future products. 
As of December 31, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Our largest committed credit line is with Bank of America N.A. in the amount of $75.0 million, which is not syndicated. We are required to meet certain financial covenants associated with our U.S. revolving line of credit. These covenants, tested quarterly, include an interest coverage ratio and a funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") ratio. The interest coverage covenant requires that we maintain a trailing twelve-month ratio of EBITDA to interest on all obligations that is at least 3.0:1.0. The funded debt to EBITDA covenant requires that the sum of all indebtedness for borrowed money on a consolidated basis be less than three times our trailing twelve months EBITDA. Funded debt is decreased by our cash and available marketable securities not classified as long-term investments in the U.S. in excess of $50 million up to a maximum of $500 million. We were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of and for the three months ended December 31, 2024. 
See Note 12, "Financing Arrangements" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our facilities.  
The following table summarizes our material cash commitments at December 31, 2024 and the effect such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods. We intend to use our existing cash, cash equivalents and short term investments as well as cash generated from operations as sources of funds for these material commitments.

Operating activities.
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $48.1 million to $247.9 million in 2024 from $296.0 million in 2023 primarily due to a decrease in net income after adding back non-cash expenses, partially offset by an increase in cash provided by working capital. Our largest working capital items are inventory and accounts receivable. Items such as accounts payable to third parties, prepaid expenses and other current assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities are not as significant as our working capital investment in accounts receivable and inventory because of the amount of value added within IPG due to our vertically integrated structure. Accruals and payables for personnel costs including bonuses and income and other taxes payable are largely dependent on the timing of payments for those items. The decrease in cash flow from operating activities in 2024 primarily resulted from:
•
a decrease in cash provided by net income after adjusting for non-cash operating activities, mainly due to lower sales; and 
•
an increase in cash used by
 income and other taxes payable due to the timing of estimated tax payments made and refunds received from filing tax returns, an installment due on the transition tax liability from the Tax Reform Act of 2017, and excise tax paid on our stock repurchase program.
The decrease in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by:
•
an increase in cash provided by accounts receivable due to the timing of collections and lower sales;
•
an increase in cash provided by inventory as supply chain disruptions moderated requiring less investment in safety stock and due to a targeted plan to reduce inventory levels;
•
an increase in cash provided by the timing of payments made for accounts payable and prepayments; and
•
a decrease in cash used by accrued expenses from lower payouts related to accrued compensation and bonuses.

Investing activities. 
Net cash provided by investing activities was $208.7 million in 2024 as compared to cash used in investing activities of $237.6 million in 2023. The cash provided by investing activities in 2024 primarily related to $370.3 million of net proceeds of short-term investments and $28.6 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by $98.5 million of cash used for property, plant and equipment, $66.7 million of cash used for the acquisition of cleanLASER and $25.3 million of net cash outflow from the divestiture of our Russian operation. The cash proceeds from the sale of our Russian operation were lower than the cash and cash equivalents on hand, resulting in a cash outflow from divestiture. The cash used in investing activities in 2023 primarily related to $158.9 million of net cash used for purchases of short-term investments, and $110.5 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by $31.2 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment.
In 2025, we expect to incur approximately $105.0 million to $115.0 million in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures include investments in property, facilities and equipment to replace capacity in Russia or increase redundant capacity for critical components and upgrade or replace equipment at other facilities that is beyond its useful life.  The timing and extent of any capital expenditures in and between periods can have a significant effect on our cash flow. Many of the capital expenditure projects that we undertake have long lead times and are difficult to cancel or defer to a later period. We intend to finance our capital expenditures with existing cash, cash equivalents and short term investments as well as with cash generated from operations.
Financing activities. 
Net cash used in financing activities was $339.6 million and $236.4 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The cash used in financing activities in 2024 was primarily related to the purchase of $343.8 million of treasury stock, partially offset by net proceeds of $4.2 million from the exercise of stock options net of amounts disbursed in relation to shares withheld to cover employee income taxes due upon the vesting and release of restricted stock units and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan. The cash used in financing activities in 2023 was primarily related to the purchase of $223.5 million of treasury stock, $16.0 million of principal payments on our long-term borrowings; partially offset by net proceeds of $3.1 million from the exercise of stock options net of amounts disbursed in relation to shares withheld to cover employee income taxes due upon the vesting and release of restricted stock units and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan.

ITEM 7A.    
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
We are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of business, which consists primarily of interest rate risk associated with our cash and cash equivalents and foreign exchange rate risk.
Interest rate risk
. Certain interest rates are variable and fluctuate with current market conditions. Our investments have limited exposure to market risk. We maintain a portfolio of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, consisting primarily of money market funds and term deposits, commercial paper, U.S. government and agency securities, term deposits, and corporate bonds. None of these investments have a maturity date in excess of one year. Because of the short-term nature of these instruments, a sudden change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.
We are also exposed to market risk as a result of increases or decreases in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our borrowings on our bank credit facilities. Although our U.S. revolving line of credit and our Euro credit facilities have variable rates, we do not believe that a 10% change in market interest rates would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
Exchange rates. 
Due to our international operations, a significant portion of our net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally the Euro and the Chinese yuan. Changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar versus the functional currencies of our subsidiaries affect the translated value and relative level of sales and net income that we report from one period to the next. In addition, our subsidiaries may have assets or liabilities denominated in a currency other than their functional currency which results in foreign exchange transaction gains and losses due to changes in the value of the functional currency versus the currency the assets and liabilities are denominated in. In 2024 we incurred a loss on foreign exchange transactions of $5.5 million as compared to a gain of $1.4 million in 2023. As our Chinese and South Korean subsidiaries have net U.S. dollar denominated liabilities, the depreciation of the Chinese yuan and South Korean won relative to the U.S. dollar contributed to most of the foreign exchange loss in 2024, partially offset by gain 
42
Table of Contents
on the depreciation of the Euro as our German subsidiary has net U.S. dollar denominated assets. Management attempts to minimize these exposures by partially or fully off-setting foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities at our subsidiaries that operate in different functional currencies. The effectiveness of this strategy can be limited by the volume of underlying transactions at various subsidiaries and by our ability to accelerate or delay inter-company cash settlements. As a result, we are unable to create a perfect offset of the foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Furthermore, if we expect a currency movement to be beneficial to us in the short or medium term, we have, on occasions, chosen not to hedge or otherwise offset the underlying assets or liabilities. However, it is difficult to predict foreign currency movements accurately. 
At December 31, 2024, our material foreign currency exposure is net U.S. dollar denominated assets at subsidiaries where the Euro is the functional currency and U.S. dollar denominated liabilities where the Chinese yuan and the South Korean won is the functional currency. The net U.S. dollar denominated assets are comprised of cash, third party receivables and inter-company receivables offset by third party and inter-company U.S. dollar denominated payables. The U.S. dollar denominated liabilities are comprised of inter-company payables. A 5% change in the relative exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the Euro applied to the net U.S. dollar asset balances as of December 31, 2024, would result in a foreign exchange gain of $1.1 million if the U.S. dollar appreciated and a $1.2 million foreign exchange loss if the U.S. dollar depreciated. A 5% change in the relative exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the Chinese yuan applied to the net U.S. dollar liability balances as of December 31, 2024, would result in a foreign exchange loss of $0.4 million if the U.S. dollar appreciated and a $0.4 million foreign exchange gain if the U.S. dollar depreciated. A 5% change in the relative exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the South Korea won applied to the net U.S. dollar liability balances as of December 31, 2024, would result in a foreign exchange loss of $0.4 million if the U.S. dollar appreciated and a $0.5 million foreign exchange gain if the U.S. dollar depreciated. Volatility between the U.S. dollar and the currencies to which we are exposed may be increased by changes in central bank policy, primarily related to interest rates.
In addition, we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk for those subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar as changes in the value of their functional currency relative to the U.S. dollar affect the translated amounts of our assets and liabilities. Changes in the translated value of assets and liabilities due to changes in functional currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar result in foreign currency translation adjustments that are a component of other comprehensive income or loss on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income.
Foreign currency derivative instruments can also be used to hedge exposures and reduce the risks of certain foreign currency transactions; however, these instruments provide only limited protection and can carry significant cost. We have no foreign currency derivative instrument hedges as of December 31, 2024. We will continue to analyze our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations and may engage in financial hedging techniques in the future to attempt to minimize the effect of these potential fluctuations. Exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our financial results in the future.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, our management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the "Evaluation Date") utilizing the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission's Internal Control - Integrated Framework ("COSO") Updated Framework issued in 2013. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the Company and its subsidiaries. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the Evaluation Date based on criteria established in COSO utilizing the Updated Framework issued in 2013. Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has audited our internal control over financial reporting, as stated in their report below.
Changes in Internal Controls
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, errors and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been or will be detected.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of IPG Photonics Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of IPG Photonics Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 20, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Leadership Transition
As the culmination of an orderly and thorough succession planning process led by our independent directors, our Board of Directors appointed Dr. Mark Gitin as our CEO and as a member of the Board, succeeding Dr. Eugene Scherbakov. Dr. Gitin joined IPG on June 5, 2024 with over 25 years of management and operating experience in the optics and laser industry. The Company entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Gitin on April 25, 2024, which includes provisions for his base salary, annual cash incentive compensation and new hire equity awards, as well as relocation assistance.  
Dr. Eugene Scherbakov transitioned from the role of CEO on June 4, 2025. Given Dr. Scherbakov's long tenure with the Company, the Board viewed it as desirable to retain the services of Dr. Scherbakov to support a successful CEO transition.  As a result, the Company also entered into an advisor agreement (the “Advisor Agreement”) with Dr. Scherbakov pursuant to which Dr. Scherbakov provides advisory services to assist with the CEO transition through June 5, 2026.  Dr. Scherbakov remains a member of the Board without additional compensation for such service.

 with a strong track record as a strategic industry leader with an ability to identify and execute on growth opportunities. 
In 2024, IPG maintained a compensation program consistent with the prior year and its pay for performance philosophy. 
IPG's revenue declined 25% compared to the prior year, with lower sales in materials processing, medical and advanced applications. Revenue continued to be negatively impacted by softer industrial demand across many geographies and weakness in demand in e-mobility and renewable energy markets. Additionally, increased competition impacted sales in cutting while weaker electric vehicle battery investment reduced sales in welding. In August 2024, IPG successfully exited Russia through the sale of its business there, which reduced sales in the second half and resulted in a charge of $198 million. 
Gross margin decreased in 2024 due to increased inventory provisions and reduced absorption of manufacturing expenses as a result of lower revenue. However, cash flow generation remained strong with cash flow from operating activities of $247.9 million.  IPG finished the year with a strong balance sheet, with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $930.2 million as of December 31, 2024.  The Company allocated capital in 2024 through the return of $343.8 million to stockholders in share repurchases, as well as investments in new product development and the acquisition of cleanLaser, a maker of laser cleaning systems.  
As a result of difficult conditions in its markets and business, the Compensation Committee of the Board determined that decisive action was necessary to support executive management in navigating these significant challenges and changes, to stabilize and retain the management team and to create value for stockholders over the long-term. As described in more detail below, such action included engagement of a new CEO with a competitive compensation package, an adjustment to the annual incentive plan with a lower payout potential, a redesign of performance share units (“PSUs”) and an enhanced long-term incentive opportunity for certain NEOs.
Stockholder-Minded Compensation Practices

•
Use Long-Term Incentives to Link Executive Pay to Company Performance
: Over half of NEO pay consists of long-term incentives.
•
Cap Annual Incentive Compensation.
•
Annual Risk Assessment of Compensation Program.
•
Independent Compensation Consultant
: The Compensation Committee retains a compensation consultant, who is independent and without conflicts of interest with the Company.

Stockholder Feedback
At our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders overwhelmingly approved our executive compensation structure in a “say-on-pay” advisory vote, with over 96% of votes cast in favor of our executive compensation structure. After considering the results of the 2024 vote, the Compensation Committee determined to maintain its general pay philosophy and practices. Proposal 2 described herein is the "say-on-pay" advisory vote.
2024 Compensation of Named Executive Officers
Our Business and Our Compensation Philosophy
The guiding principles of our executive compensation philosophy and practices continue to be pay-for-performance, accountability for annual and long-term performance, alignment to stockholders’ interests and providing competitive pay to attract and retain executives. We believe our compensation program strikes the appropriate balance between utilizing responsible, measured pay practices and effectively incentivizing our executives to dedicate themselves fully to value creation for our stockholders.
Our executive compensation program is designed to focus our executive officers on both annual and long-term financial and operational performance without encouraging unnecessary risk. Approximately 76% and 79% of the total direct target compensation opportunities for our current CEO and other NEOs (average, excluding our former CEO), respectively, in 2024 was at risk. "At risk" compensation includes awards that are subject to performance conditions and/or stock price performance. Because Dr. Gitin received a new hire bonus for 2024 with a fixed payout pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement, the amount of "at risk" compensation for Dr. Gitin for 2024 was lower than is typical for our CEO.
The 2024 compensation program for our NEOs had three primary components: annual base salary, annual cash incentives and long-term equity incentives. The amounts below illustrate the average allocation of fiscal year compensation components at target for our current CEO and the average for our other NEOs (excluding our former CEO) in 2024 as a group.
The following is an overview of the primary compensation program elements for our NEOs.

Base Salary 
We provide base salary to our NEOs and other employees to compensate them for services rendered on a day-to-day basis during the fiscal year. Unlike annual cash incentives and long-term equity incentives, base salary is not subject to performance risk. The Compensation Committee reviews data provided by its independent compensation consultant and considers the following factors when setting base salaries of the NEOs: experience, skills, seniority, knowledge and responsibilities of the executive and the individual’s performance assessment provided by the CEO. With respect to the CEO, the Compensation Committee additionally considers the performance of the Company as a whole in its recommendation to the independent directors, who set CEO compensation.
In February 2024, the Compensation Committee evaluated the base salaries and total cash compensation for the then-serving NEOs with the assistance of Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook"), its independent compensation consultant.  The base salaries for Drs. Scherbakov and Samartsev, and Messrs. Mammen and Lopresti were unchanged from 2023 levels. However, the Compensation Committee approved increasing the base salaries of Mr. Ness and Dr. Ovtchinnikov by 5%  because of their expanded executive responsibilities following the passing of the Company’s Chief Operating Officer at the end of 2023. Mr. Ness assumed oversight of the medical and systems businesses,  procurement, technical support and service, and Dr. Ovtchinnikov took over management of our electrical and software engineering, our Canadian operations, facilities and safety.
On April 25, 2024, the Company and Dr. Gitin entered into an employment agreement, which provides for an initial annual base salary of $775,000. The Compensation Committee engaged FW Cook to provide market data on peer compensation for CEOs as well as advice on the terms of his compensation package and new chief executive hiring practices. The Compensation Committee considered the data and advice from the independent compensation consultant in establishing Dr. Gitin’s compensation and employment terms.
Annual Incentives 
A significant portion of an executive's potential short-term compensation is in the form of annual cash incentive pay tied to the achievement of goals set by the Compensation Committee under our Senior Executive Annual Incentive Plan ("AIP") administered by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee determines who is eligible to receive awards under the AIP, defines performance goals and objectives for executives, establishes target awards for each participant for the relevant performance period, and determines the percentage of the target award that should be allocated to the achievement of each of the chosen performance goals. Generally, after the end of the fiscal year, the independent directors and the Compensation Committee determine the amount of the CEO’s and each of the other NEO’s actual annual incentive award, respectively, based upon their evaluation of achievement against pre-determined goals.
Financial performance above target results in a payout of a higher percentage of a NEO's target bonus, up to 200% of the NEO’s total target cash bonus. Performance below target results in a lower bonus payout for that goal if a minimum threshold is met, with 37.5% of the NEO’s total target cash bonus as the minimum in such circumstance, or no payout if the minimum threshold is not met.  The CEO can earn up to 25% of his target award based upon personal goals and objectives determined by the independent directors. The other NEOs are also eligible for payouts up to 25% of the target award based on their individual performance in support of the CEO’s goals and other objectives, the recommendation of the CEO and other factors the Compensation Committee deems relevant. The maximum opportunity under the AIP is 225% of the total target payout.
In February 2024, The Compensation Committee approved annual performance targets and targeted individual payouts for the Company’s then-serving NEOs for fiscal year 2024. Consistent with prior years, the Compensation Committee identified two financial performance measures: net sales and adjusted EBIT, each as determined under the AIP, and assigned a 50% weighting factor to each financial performance goal. Net sales under the AIP is the same as net sales as reported in our financial statements and adjusted EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and taxes, excluding stock-based compensation and foreign exchange transaction gains and losses. The Compensation Committee chose to focus on net sales and adjusted EBIT so that our NEOs would be incentivized to deliver the types of financial performance that benefit our stockholders, namely, sales and profits. The total payout targets were set at 110% of base salary for Dr. Scherbakov and 80% of base salary for the other NEOs, except for Dr. Samartsev, whose annual incentive target was set at 50% of base salary. The target payouts as a percentage of salary were consistent with 2023.

Financial Objective and Funding Mechanism/Determination
In February 2024, the Compensation Committee set the financial performance goals for the year based upon the best available information at the time. The goals were challenging and were expected to incentivize the NEOs to advance IPG’s strategic and operational priorities.  The funding levels for the 2024 AIP, as originally set in February 2024, for the achievement of the performance criteria range from 0% to 267% of the target financial performance payout, depending on the achievement of such criteria. The following table sets forth the original threshold, targets and maximum financial performance levels under the AIP approved in February (the "Original AIP"):

In August 2024, the broader macroeconomic environment led the Board to revise expectations for fiscal 2024. As a result, the Committee undertook a review and determined that financial performance measures and targets in the Original AIP were no longer appropriate to incentivize management to create long-term stockholder value in light of macroeconomic uncertainty, 
which impacted industrial and e-mobility markets and were outside of management's control. This uncertainty weighed on demand, leading to substantially lower revenue compared to the Company's 2024 annual operating plan earlier approved by the Board. The Compensation Committee considered, among other factors, the challenging demand environment across the Company's key economic regions and that uncertainty across all major geographies was likely to weigh on demand for the remainder of the year. The Committee also considered independent third-party market data and purchasing managers indices which reflected lower levels of industrial purchasing across the Company’s principal markets.  In light of the Board's revised expectations for performance for the remainder of 2024, and taking into account management’s strong financial and operational execution to date in the year, including cost reductions, inventory reductions and planning to sell its Russian operations which position the Company for improved performance as the global demand environment recovers, and the need to retain and motivate the management in a year of CEO leadership transition, 
the Committee approved a revised AIP in August 2024 (the "Revised AIP") to align annual cash incentive pay more closely with the Company's goals and revised expectations  for 2024. 
The financial performance measure under the Revised AIP was net sales for the second half of 2024 and the total payout for financial and personal performance under the Revised AIP was capped at 62.5% of the
 original target payout, which corresponds to payout at threshold performance under the Original AIP. The Compensation Committee chose net sales as the sole financial measure for the Revised AIP because of the uncertainty of earnings in light of cost cutting measures that were in development then, potential restructuring charges, the potential financial impacts from the sale our Russian operations, and additional sanctions impacting the Company's supply chain. The following table sets forth the threshold, targets and maximum financial performance levels under the Revised AIP.

Pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement, Dr. Gitin, who commenced employment in June 2024, received a new hire bonus for fiscal year 2024 equal to 100% of his base salary, payable at the same time as payouts for the other NEOs under the 2024 AIP, and was not a participant in the Original AIP or the Revised AIP. Drs. Scherbakov and Ovtchinnikov were not impacted by the Revised AIP because they 
were no longer executive officers at the time of payout of the Revised AIP.
Individual Performance Factor
Individual objectives are set for each NEO to support the Company’s strategic objectives and are tied to the areas of responsibilities of each NEO. Below is a summary of the primary 2024 objectives for each NEO who received a personal performance award in 2024:

In addition, a portion of the individual performance achievement for each NEO was based on increasing collaboration within the leadership team and functional group. The Compensation Committee evaluated individual performance of each non-CEO NEO employed at year-end based Dr. Gitin’s recommendation, which was based on his assessment of their individual achievement of 2024 goals. The individual performance achievement for each of the non-CEO NEOs employed at year-end is set forth in the table below.
2024 Payouts
The table below includes the Revised AIP payouts to our NEOs in office at the end of 2024. Drs. Scherbakov and Ovtchinnikov were not eligible to receive bonuses under the 2024 AIP and Dr. Gitin did not participate in the Revised AIP in light of his new hire bonus.

Long-Term Incentives
The goal of our equity-based award program is to provide employees and executives with the perspective of an owner having a long-term financial stake in our success, further increasing alignment with stockholders. Our equity-based incentives align the interests of our executives and stockholders by motivating executives to increase long-term stockholder value.
In 2024, our equity-based award program for our NEOs included PSUs and RSUs, with each award type representing half of the overall 2024 long-term incentive award opportunity (at target for the PSUs). The type and proportion of the equity grants reflected a review by our Compensation Committee, with the assistance of FW Cook, of equity award practices at peer companies. The Committee believes that granting a balance of PSUs and RSUs appropriately aligns executive compensation with the achievement of the Company’s strategic goals and long-term stockholder value creation. Additionally, the value of the PSUs and RSUs is tied to the Company's stock price, which further links pay to performance.
2024 EQUITY ELEMENTS
(at target)
In February 2024, the Compensation Committee evaluated the size of long-term incentive award against applicable market comparisons. In addition to market comparisons, the Compensation Committee retains the flexibility to adjust individual award levels, taking into account variations in the individual’s job experience and responsibility. In 2024, the Compensation Committee used competitive market data from the total compensation study of peer companies and broader market survey data to gain perspective of appropriately competitive executive compensation. The Compensation Committee analyzed several aspects of the equity grant program, including (i) the degree to which executives have incentives to remain employed by the Company through unvested award value and (ii) the aggregate equity usage in terms of (a) annual usage, typically called burn 
57
Table of Contents
rate, and (b) cumulative equity delivery, typically called overhang, to determine the dilutive effect of equity awards on investors.
In setting equity award values for 2024, the Compensation Committee also took into consideration the actual performance of the NEOs in driving long-term stockholder value during the prior periods’ challenges and uncertainties facing IPG, including competition, geopolitical events and dynamic economic and market environments. In order to provide additional incentive, to further align the interests of the NEOs with our stockholders, and to motivate the NEOs to drive continued future performance in 2024 and beyond, the Compensation Committee approved a one-time, additional equity award opportunity for NEOs other than the CEO as part of the annual grant cycle in 2024. 
The form and value of such awards were determined after considering a variety of factors and using input from the Compensation Committee’s independent compensation consultant. In evaluating the size of 2024 equity grants and the one-time, additional equity award, the Compensation Committee considered the value of the unvested equity awards held by the executive team prior to and after the granting of 2024 equity awards. Prior to the 2024 grants, all of our NEOs held less than 1x their annual equity award grant in unvested equity awards (taking into account the vesting event in March 2024), which the Compensation Committee determined was not sufficiently motivating or retentive.
The one-time, additional equity award was in the form of additional RSUs and PSUs in proportion to the annual equity awards, with three-year vesting and a three-year performance period for retention and to incent long-term performance.  The Compensation Committee believed the additional value was reasonable, consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy, and it was intended to support retention and further align the long-term interests of the NEOs with those of our stockholders. The enhanced target value opportunities for the NEOs, other than Drs. Scherbakov and Samartsev, represented 40% of the regular annual equity awards. Dr. Samartsev received an enhanced equity award that represented 10% of his regular annual equity award. The Committee did not provide a one-time enhanced equity award to Dr. Scherbakov.
The 2024 equity awards are comprised of PSUs that are earned based upon organic revenue growth (at target, 25% of award value), and operating margin (at target, 25% of award value), and service-based RSUs (50% of award value). The Committee chose organic revenue growth and adjusted operating margin as the PSU performance metrics because they are generally accepted as two fundamental drivers of sustained stockholder value and provide clearer line-of-sight measurements than many alternative measures. The Committee determined that the 2024 PSUs would be eligible to be earned based on annual performance over a three-year performance period starting on January 1, 2024. 
Performance for each measure is based on the annual growth rate for the period measured against revenue or operating margin actually achieved in the prior period.  Organic revenue and operating margin targets for 2024 were set based upon the annual budget approved by the Board with the intent to incentivize and reward the NEOs for achieving targeted revenue growth. Organic revenue means total revenues, as determined under GAAP and recorded in our audited financial statements, adjusted to exclude the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, other than acquisitions that account for additional revenue of $50 million or less in the relevant year. Operating margin is calculated by dividing our GAAP operating income by GAAP net sales. For purposes of this calculation, operating income is adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation, the impact of all restructurings, impairments, legal settlements, employee separation costs, product liability charges and foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, to the extent such items were not contemplated and included in the target upon which the operating margin goals were based. 
Performance below the target results in below target payout, subject to a threshold performance level below which no award would be earned, and performance above the target results in payout above target, subject to a maximum cap of 200% of the target award. The Committee lowered the threshold payout to 25% of target from 60% in the prior year.  Forward-looking targets for our PSUs are not disclosed because these targets involve confidential financial information, the disclosure of which would result in competitive harm and be detrimental to our operating performance. However, the Compensation Committee has set such goals at challenging levels that they believe are difficult to achieve and would require sustained performance against our annual operating plan. The chart below under "Historical PSU Payouts" sets forth the payouts under the PSUs over the last several years illustrating the difficulty of attaining the performance goals set by the Compensation Committee. The goals will be disclosed at the end of the performance period along with the achievement levels and corresponding vesting of the performance-based restricted stock awards, if any.
The PSUs granted in 2024 cliff vest to the extent earned in March 2027. They serve as a valuable retention tool and motivate executives to achieve our longer-term business objectives. RSUs vest annually in March over a three-year period and also encourage retention. PSUs and RSUs granted in 2024 are entitled to dividends equivalents, should any dividends be paid. Any dividends equivalents on shares underlying the PSUs and RSUs are not paid unless and until the corresponding awards vest. 
The table below provides information on grants of PSUs and RSUs to the NEOs in 2024. As described below, Dr. Gitin's awards were granted in June 2024 in connection with his appointment as CEO and have the same performance measures as those granted to other NEOs in February 2024.

Historical Performance of Performance-Based Stock Units.
Half of PSUs granted in 2021 (which vested in 2024) were eligible to be earned based on the ratio of operating cash flow to adjusted net income ("OCF PSUs") over a three-year performance period beginning January 1, 2021 and ending December 31, 2023. Such OCF PSUs vested in March 2024 at 66.3% of target. PSUs granted in 2021 that were eligible to be earned based on three-year relative total stockholder return ("TSR") compared to the approved index were not earned, as performance was below threshold.
The following table shows the performance of the 2021 OCF PSUs:

As three-year performance was below threshold for PSUs granted in 2022, the NEOs did not earn any payouts on the performance-based long-term incentives vesting in March 2025.

Compensation Related to Leadership Transitions
The Board appointed Dr. Gitin as CEO of the Company, effective June 5, 2024, and  also appointed Dr. Gitin to the Board of Directors. Dr. Gitin does not receive any additional compensation for his service on the Board.
As a condition of accepting employment, the Company and Dr. Gitin entered into an employment agreement (the “Gitin Employment Agreement”) with an initial term commencing on June 5, 2024 and ending on December 31, 2025. The term of the Gitin Employment Agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year periods unless Dr. Gitin or the Company provides at least 180 days’ prior written notice or unless the agreement is earlier terminated according with its provisions. Under the terms of the Gitin Employment Agreement, Dr. Gitin received an initial annual base salary of $775,000, which is subject to periodic review by the Board. Dr. Gitin is also eligible to earn an annual cash bonus calculated as a percentage of his base salary. The Gitin Employment Agreement provided Dr. Gitin a new hire bonus equal to 100% of his base salary for fiscal year 2024, provided that his employment was not terminated by the Company for “cause” or by Dr. Gitin without “good reason” (each as defined in the Gitin Employment Agreement) prior to the date that bonuses were paid for fiscal year 2024.  Dr. Gitin also received initial equity awards with a target aggregate grant date fair value of $5,000,000, with 50% in the form of PSUs that are earned only if pre-determined financial performance metrics are achieved and 50% in the form of RSUs. The Compensation Committee determined the target aggregate value after consultation with its independent compensation consultant and taking into account both the Company’s customary target annual equity award and a partial buyout of equity forfeited upon Dr. Gitin's departure from his former employer.  The RSUs vest in three equal annual installments following Dr. Gitin’s start date. The PSUs vest on the third anniversary of Dr. Gitin’s start date, subject to achievement of the applicable performance metrics. The PSUs have the same performance criteria and measurement periods as those granted to the Company’s other NEOs in February 2024.
After reviewing competitive market references,  the Company granted Dr. Gitin a relocation stipend of $500,000 to facilitate his relocation from California to Massachusetts and provided him with temporary housing for up to six months. Dr. Gitin is also eligible to participate in the employee benefit plans and programs made available by the Company to senior executives generally, subject to the terms of those plans.
The compensation payable to Dr. Gitin under the Gitin Employment Agreement in the event of a qualifying termination of his employment with the Company is described in 
Post-Employment Compensation and Other Employment Agreements 
below. 
In connection with the CEO transition, the Board viewed it as desirable to retain the services of Dr. Scherbakov through the period of transition, and to provide appropriate compensation to Dr. Scherbakov for supporting the transition to Dr. Gitin. Therefore, the Company entered into the Advisor Agreement with Dr. Scherbakov pursuant to which Dr. Scherbakov provides advisory services to assist in the transition of Dr. Gitin through June 5, 2026 or the earlier termination of Dr. Scherbakov’s services for “cause” or Dr. Scherbakov’s death or “disability” (each as defined in the Advisor Agreement).  Dr. Scherbakov remains a member of the Board without additional compensation for such service.  Under the Advisor Agreement, the Company pays Dr. Scherbakov a consulting fee of €1,240,000 through June 5, 2025, a consulting fee of €800,000 from June 6, 2025 to June 5, 2026 and an additional cash payment of approximately €400 per month to cover out of pocket payments for

health insurance premiums during the term of the Advisor Agreement. In addition, pursuant to the terms of those awards, Dr. Scherbakov continues to vest in his outstanding equity awards for so long as he continues to provide services to the Company.
Dr. Ovtchinnikov retired from the Company, effective September 15, 2024. The Company and Dr. Ovtchinnikov entered into a services agreement pursuant to which Dr. Ovtchinnikov agreed to provide to the Company consulting services through March 31, 2025 for a consulting fee of $17,000 per month. Outstanding equity awards previously granted to Dr. Ovtchinnikov continue to vest for so long as he continues to provide consulting services to the Company pursuant to the services agreement. The Company also pays the cost of monthly COBRA premiums for Dr. Ovtchinnikov and his dependents until March 16, 2026.
Other Compensation
Severance Benefits.

The severance benefits that we offer to our NEOs assist us in recruiting and retaining talented individuals and are consistent with the range of severance benefits offered by our peer group. The severance provisions of our NEO employment agreements are summarized in 
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control
 below.
Retirement Benefits.
 We do not offer an executive retirement plan or a non-qualified deferred compensation plan. Executives in the United States are eligible to participate in our 401(k) retirement savings plan on the same terms as all other U.S. employees. Our 401(k) retirement savings plan is a tax-qualified plan and therefore is subject to certain Internal Revenue Code limitations on the dollar amounts of deferrals and Company contributions that can be made to plan accounts. These limitations apply to our more highly-compensated employees (including the NEOs). We make matching contributions to our employees at a rate of 50% of deferrals subject to a maximum of 6% of eligible compensation under the 401(k) retirement savings plan, including the NEOs, who participate in the plan as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table. Dr. Scherbakov has historically participated in a German government-sponsored retirement program.
Other Benefits.
 Our executives are eligible to participate in our employee benefit plans, subject to the terms of those plans, including medical, dental, life and disability insurance and vacation plans as well as an employee stock purchase plan, which is intended to be qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The employee stock purchase plan allows participants to purchase Company shares at a price equal to 85% of the lesser of the fair market value at the first day or last day of the six month offering period, subject to limitations on the amount of shares. These plans generally are available to all salaried employees and do not discriminate in favor of executives. Benefits are intended to be competitive with the overall market in order to facilitate attraction and retention of highly-qualified employees.
Executive Compensation Decision-Making
Role of Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee determines, approves and administers the compensation programs for our executive officers, including our NEOs. The Compensation Committee recommends to the independent directors the CEO’s annual base salary, annual incentive opportunity and long-term incentive opportunity. The independent directors approve the CEO’s compensation and our Compensation Committee approves the compensation for other executive officers in consultation with our CEO. Our Compensation Committee is also responsible for making recommendations to the Board with respect to the adoption of equity plans and certain other benefit plans. The Compensation Committee and the independent directors meet in executive sessions when determining executive compensation. 
The Compensation Committee may delegate authority whenever it deems appropriate. In 2024, the Compensation Committee delegated authority to grant equity awards for non-executives to the CEO, subject to certain conditions, including amounts of awards and review of awards by the Compensation Committee.
Role of Management
The CEO participates in the establishment of compensation levels and payouts for individual performance for other NEOs. He assesses the performance of all NEOs and recommends to the Compensation Committee the overall levels of achievement and personal performance in the year. Upon request, the NEOs provide supplemental material to the Compensation Committee to assist in the determination and implementation of compensation, policies and practices. The CEO is not involved in decisions regarding the setting of any component of his compensation. The CEO and other members of senior management attend Compensation Committee meetings at the invitation of the Compensation Committee.

Table of Contents
Role of Independent Consultant
The Compensation Committee engaged FW Cook, an independent compensation consultant, to analyze our executive and non-employee director compensation programs and advise on incentive design and other compensation-related policies and programs. The consultation included non-executive compensation data and valuation services for equity incentives. FW Cook does not perform any other work for the Company. The Compensation Committee reviewed the independence of FW Cook in light of SEC rules and Nasdaq listing standards regarding compensation consultants. Based on such review, the Compensation Committee determined that there were no actual or potential conflicts of interest with FW Cook in 2024.
Pay Positioning Strategy and Peer Group
Our Compensation Committee’s policy is to set executive pay in accordance with the objectives of the Company’s compensation programs as described above. In the Compensation Committee’s view, the Company’s executive compensation program provides an overall level of compensation opportunity that is competitive with peer companies. Actual compensation levels may be greater or less than target compensation levels provided by similar companies based upon annual and long-term Company performance, as well as individual performance, contributions, skills, seniority, knowledge, experience and responsibilities.
The Committee does not benchmark specific compensation elements or total compensation to any specific percentile relative to the peer companies or the broader United States market. Instead, the Committee applies judgment and discretion in establishing targeted pay levels, taking into account not only competitive market data, but also factors such as Company, business and individual performance, scope of responsibility, critical needs and skill sets, leadership potential, length of tenure and succession planning. No single factor takes precedence over any other, nor is any formula used in making these decisions.
 In late 2023, FW Cook performed an analysis of similarly-situated public companies and supplemented the peer group with broader, size-appropriate comparisons in the high technology industry using applicable survey data. Consistent with prior years, in 2024 the Compensation Committee used competitive compensation data from the annual total compensation study of peer companies to inform its decisions about overall compensation opportunities and specific compensation elements.
The Compensation Committee reviews this peer group annually with input from its independent compensation consultant to ensure that the comparisons are meaningful. In this review, the Compensation Committee considers several factors: it considers the current peer group to determine appropriateness, the peers used by institutional governance advisors, the companies that list our Company as a peer to understand crossover peers and broader research based upon established selection criteria to identify potential future peers. The Committee then develops criteria for business sector, including but not limited to revenue and market capitalization. In determining peer companies for 2024, the Compensation Committee reviewed peer companies with then recent revenue and average market capitalization between approximately 0.2x to 5.0x the Company's size at that time for laser-related companies and 0.4x to 2.5x the Company's size for non-laser related companies.
Based upon the process and applying the criteria above, the Compensation Committee, with input from FW Cook, approved adding Allegro MicroSystems Inc. and OSI Systems, Inc. to our 2024 peer group and removing National Instruments, Inc. from our 2024 peer group because it was acquired in October 2023.

COMPANY VS. PEER GROUP
Other Factors Affecting Compensation
Tax Deductibility under Section 162(m).
 Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (“Section 162(m)”) limits the deductibility for federal income tax purposes of certain compensation paid in any year by a publicly held corporation to its “covered employees” as defined by Section 162(m) (generally, our current and former NEOs) to $1 million per executive (the “$1 million cap”). While our Board and Compensation Committee consider the potential effects of Section 162(m) of the Code on the compensation paid to our NEOs, the Compensation Committee believes it is appropriate to retain the flexibility to authorize compensation that may exceed the $1 million cap if, in the Compensation Committee’s judgment, it is in the Company’s best interest to do so. We generally will continue to emphasize performance-based compensation, even though it may no longer be deductible.
Accounting Considerations.
 We consider the accounting implications of our executive compensation program. In addition, accounting treatment is just one of many factors impacting plan design and pay determinations. Our executive compensation program is designed to achieve a favorable accounting and tax treatment so long as doing so does not conflict with the intended plan design or program objectives.
Compensation Risk
Management conducts an annual risk assessment of the Company’s compensation policies and practices for all employees, including non-executives, and reports its findings to the Compensation Committee. In 2024, management concluded that the Company’s compensation policies and practices are balanced and do not motivate imprudent risk taking. Management believes that the Company's compensation policies do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In reaching this conclusion, they considered the following factors:
•
our compensation program is designed to provide a mix of both fixed and variable incentive compensation;
•
our senior executives are subject to stock ownership guidelines, which we believe incentivize our executives to consider the long-term interests of the Company and our stockholders and discourage excessive risk-taking that could negatively impact our stock price;
•
our senior executives are subject to compensation recovery policy, which discourages excessive risk-taking that could negatively affect our stock price;
63
Table of Contents
•
our incentive compensation programs are designed with vesting terms that are relatively consistent, spread out over several years, and do not contain steep payout “cliffs” that might encourage short-term business decisions in order to meet a vesting or payout threshold; and
•
our senior executive incentive compensation program caps the amounts that may be paid for performance above target level.
Other Policies
Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging. 
The Board adopted policies prohibiting hedging transactions and the pledging of our common stock. Under our insider trading policy, no director or employee may engage in shorting shares of our common stock or any type of securities that we may issue, or buying or selling puts, calls or derivatives related to our common stock. Additionally, directors and officers of the Company may not pledge any Company shares.
Executive Officer Stock Ownership Guidelines. 
The Board adopted stock ownership guidelines to closely align the interests of our executives with those of our long-term stockholders. Generally, the CEO must hold five times his annual salary in Company equity, and senior executive officers must hold at least two times their respective annual salaries in Company equity. Unvested RSUs subject solely to time-based vesting count toward required stock ownership levels, however stock options (whether vested or unvested) and unvested PSUs do not. Indirect ownership of shares through a separate legal entity counts toward fulfillment of the ownership guidelines. Ownership requirements are to be achieved no later than four years after being appointed as an executive officer, except that prior to such time the officer is expected to retain a certain portion of stock issued upon exercise of stock options or vesting of RSUs and PSUs until the minimum ownership levels are attained. As of December 31, 2024, each of our NEOs exceeded their respective ownership requirements or was within the four-year phase-in period.
Clawback Policies. 
In July 2023, the Compensation Committee approved a new clawback policy. The Incentive Based Compensation Recoupment Policy (the "Required Clawback Policy”) complies with the SEC’s clawback rules as required under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd Frank Act”), and provides that in the event the Company is required to prepare a “financial restatement” (as defined in the Required Clawback Policy), the Company will, subject to certain limited exceptions as described in the Required Clawback Policy, recover certain incentive based compensation from “covered persons” (i.e., current and former “executive officers”, defined to include any president/CEO, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer (or if there is no such accounting officer, the controller), any vice president in charge of a principal business unit, division or function, or any officer or person who performs a policy making functions who served during the performance period applicable to “incentive based compensation” and received “incentive based compensation” after beginning service in any such role). Compensation to be recovered under the Required Clawback Policy includes “incentive based compensation” received during the three-year period prior to the “restatement date” (as defined in the Required Clawback Policy) that exceeds the amount that otherwise would have been received by the “covered person” had such compensation been determined based on the restated amounts in the financial restatement. Under the Required Clawback Policy, “incentive based compensation” includes any cash or equity compensation that is granted, earned or vested based, in whole or in part, upon the attainment of a financial reporting measure. The Required Clawback Policy applies to "incentive based compensation” received by a “covered person” on or after October 2, 2023.
The Board had previously adopted a compensation recovery policy in 2015 that allows the Company to recapture cash and equity performance-based compensation from executives if the amount of the award was based upon achieving certain financial results that were later restated due to the participant’s misconduct. This policy remains in effect and would apply to compensation received prior to October 2, 2023 that is not covered by the Required Clawback Policy. In addition, all equity award agreements covering equity awarded to executives since 2007 contain a provision under which employees may be required to forfeit equity awards or profit from equity awards if they engage in certain conduct, including competing against the Company, disclosing confidential information, or soliciting its employees or customers.
Policy Regarding Options and Similar Equity Awards
We do not currently grant new awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights or similar option-like equity awards. Accordingly, we have no specific policy or practice on the timing of grants of such awards in relation to the disclosure of material nonpublic information. In the event we determine to grant new awards of stock options or similar equity awards in the future, the Compensation Committee will evaluate the appropriate steps to take in relation to the foregoing.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
Messrs. Dougherty, Meurice and Peeler and Ms. Desmond served as members of our Compensation Committee in 2024. None of these persons has at any time been an officer or employee of our Company or any of our subsidiaries or had any other relationship with the Company requiring disclosure herein. During fiscal year 2024, none of the Company’s executive officers served as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of another entity in which one of the executive officers of such entity served as a member of the Company’s Board or Compensation Committee.

Valuation based on the fair value of such awards as of the grant date determined pursuant to ASC Topic 718. The assumptions that we used with respect to the valuation of equity awards are set forth in Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. Regardless of the value placed on an equity award on the grant date, the actual value of the equity award will depend on the market value of our common stock when such equity award vests, and, with respect to PSUs, on the Company's performance relative to the applicable performance metrics under such PSUs, as described above under 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis-Long Term Incentives
. For PSUs granted in 2024, the maximum number of PSUs that can be earned is two times the target number of PSUs and the values of the award at the grant date assuming the highest level of performance conditions will be achieved are $4,999,671, $2,262,317, $1,928,504, $1,869,006, $489,823, $4,994,393 and $1,944,416 fo
r Dr. Gitin, Messrs. Mammen, Ness and Lopresti, and Drs. Samartsev, Scherbakov and Ovtchinnikov, respectively.

In the event of a change in control, the agreements would extend through the second anniversary of the change in control. The employment agreements set the annual base salaries and stipulate that the Compensation Committee may adjust the salaries annually, as noted in 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Base Salary
 above. The agreements entitle these executive officers to participate in bonus plans, standard insurance plans such as life, short-term disability and long-term disability insurance and retirement benefits, such as the 401(k) retirement savings plan and equity award plans described above, on similar terms and on a similar basis as such benefits are available to executives at similar levels within the Company.
Termination without "cause" or for "good reason"
If the Company terminates the employment of any of the NEOs without cause (as defined in the respective employment agreements and, for Dr. Gitin, including a non-renewal of the term of the Gitin Employment Agreement by the Company) or any of the NEOs terminates his employment for good reason (as defined in the respective employment agreements) (such terminations are referred to below as “Involuntary Terminations”), then the NEO would receive:
•
continuation of salary for twenty-four months for the CEO and eighteen months for the other NEOs;
•
a pro-rata portion of the annual bonus that the NEO would have received had he remained employed through the end of the applicable bonus period, based on actual performance, provided that, with respect to any personal performance evaluation element of the annual bonus calculation, if all financial metric components meet or exceed the target level of performance, the NEO shall be deemed awarded 100% of the potential personal performance evaluation bonus; if no financial metric bonus is awarded, no personal performance evaluation bonus will be deemed awarded, and amounts in between the threshold and target levels of performance will be determined by linear interpolation (such portion based on the percentage of the year that the NEO was employed by the Company) (the "Pro-Rated Bonus");
•
cash reimbursement for continuation of health benefits for up to twenty-four months for the CEO and eighteen months for the other NEOs; and
•
accelerated vesting of time-based RSU awards held by Dr. Gitin and equity compensation awards held by the other NEOs that otherwise would have vested within twelve months following the termination of employment, except that awards granted to Dr. Gitin in connection with his appointment as CEO in June 2024 will vest in their entirety, with

Table of Contents
PSUs vesting at target performance and, for purposes of accelerated vesting, time-based RSUs held by Dr. Gitin shall be deemed to vest in equal monthly installments over three years.
Termination without "cause" or for "good reason" within 24 months following a change in control
Upon an Involuntary Termination within twenty-four months following a change in control of the Company, the NEO would be entitled to continuation of salary and reimbursement of COBRA premiums for health benefits for twenty-four months or, in the case of Dr. Gitin, a lump-sum payment equal to twenty-four months of his base salary and reimbursement for health premiums for up to twenty-four months, the Pro-Rated Bonus for the year of termination plus a payment of two times the average annual bonus paid to the NEO for the three full years preceding the year of termination, or, in the case of Dr. Gitin, two times his target annual bonus for the year in which the change in control occurs if such change of control occurs before three completed years of employment. Under the employment agreements, all equity awards vest fully upon an Involuntary Termination that occurs within two years of a change in control, with PSUs vesting at target performance. Upon a change in control, the term of the employment agreements would automatically be extended to the second anniversary of the change in control if such date is later than expiration of the current term. 
If the total value of all payments and benefits, including any equity vesting (“total payments”), made to a NEO in connection with or on account of a change in control would result in an excise tax under the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 4999 (the “golden parachute tax”), the total payments will be reduced so that the maximum amount of total payments (after reduction) is $1.00 less than the amount that would cause the total payments to be subject to the golden parachute tax; provided, however, that the total payments will only be reduced to the extent that the after-tax value of amounts received by the NEO after application of the above reduction would exceed the after-tax value of the total payments received without application of such reduction (so called “best after-tax treatment”).
Death
If a NEO's employment is terminated by death, the NEO will receive a Pro-Rated Bonus, and all RSUs outstanding on such date will immediately vest and all PSUs outstanding on such date will immediately vest at one hundred percent (100%) of target level.
Disability
If a NEO's employment is terminated due to "disability" (as defined in the respective employment agreement), the NEO will receive a Pro-Rated Bonus for the year of termination. 
With respect to equity awards granted after July 2021, if a NEO's employment is terminated due to disability, such RSUs outstanding on such date shall immediately vest and such PSUs outstanding on such date will vest, if at all, on the vesting date set forth in the award agreement on a pro-rated basis at the actual achievement level earned at the end of the performance period.
With respect to equity awards granted prior to July 2021, if a NEO's employment is terminated due to disability, such unvested awards will immediately be forfeited as of such date.
Termination following non-renewal 
If the term of the employment agreement of any of the NEOs other than Dr. Gitin terminates and the Company does not offer such NEO continued employment in the same or a substantially similar position or in a higher position than the NEO's position at the end of the term and at a compensation level that is the same or substantially similar to the compensation level in effect at the end of the employment period, then such NEO may resign from employment and would receive continuation of salary and health benefits for twelve months, plus a Pro-Rated Bonus.
For Cause or Other Than for Good Reason
Under the employment agreements, the Company would not be obligated to provide any severance payments or benefits if employment were terminated by the Company for cause or by the NEO other than for good reason.
Additional Terms
Severance payments to the NEOs are conditioned upon the release of claims by the NEO in favor of the Company. Each of the NEOs entered into a separate restrictive agreement that prohibits each from competing with the Company for a period of one year after the termination of his employment with the Company for any reason and from hiring or attempting to hire the Company’s employees or soliciting customers or suppliers of the Company for a period ending eighteen months following the termination of his employment for any reason. Each of the NEOs is entitled to receive his base salary for the period during which the Company enforces the non-competition provisions of the agreement but not for more than one year following termination of his employment.

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
The following table provides information regarding compensation and benefits that would be payable to our NEOs as of December 31, 2024, upon an Involuntary Termination absent a change in control and within twenty-four months following a change in control and upon terminations in other circumstances. The incentive plan severance was calculated using the actual amount awarded under the Revised AIP. There can be no assurance that the event triggering payments would produce the same or similar results as those described below if such event occurs on any other date or at any other price, or if any other assumption used to estimate the potential payments and benefits is changed. Any actual payments and benefits may be different due to a number of factors that affect the nature and amount of any potential payments or benefits.
Drs. Scherbakov and Ovtchinnikov terminated employment on June 4, 2024 and September 15, 2024, respectively, and were not entitled to severance payments or benefits in connection with their termination of employment. Drs. Scherbakov and Ovtchinnikov are eligible for payments and continued vesting of equity awards during the periods in which they are providing consulting services to the Company, as described in

Equity acceleration is calculated at the full value of service-based RSUs. For PSUs tied to the performance period ending on December 31, 2024, the actual number of PSUs earned was used in the calculation; for PSUs tied to performance beyond 2024, the target number of PSUs was used in the calculations.

CEO Pay Ratio
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information on the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Dr. Mark Gitin, our CEO.
Determining our Median Employee: 
As of December 31, 2024, the measurement date, we employed 4,602 employees, 58% of whom were located outside of the U.S. This includes all full-time, part-time, and temporary employees. It does not include independent contractors. Prior to the measurement date, IPG completed the disposition of its Russian subsidiary, IRE-Polus, and employees of IRE-Polus are therefore not included in this total.
As permitted by applicable SEC rules, in identifying our median employee, we used the "de minimis" exemption to exclude from our employee population 224 workers in the following jurisdictions (employees excluded in parenthesis): Mexico (54), India (44), Korea (40), Turkey (18), United Kingdom (15), Brazil (12), Czech Republic (9), France (8), Spain (6), Thailand (5), Taiwan (5), Malaysia (3), Vietnam (2) and Singapore (1).
The SEC rules required us to identify our median employee by use of a consistently applied compensation measure (“CACM”). We chose a CACM that closely approximates the annual total cash compensation of our employees. Specifically, we identified the median employee as of December 31, 2024, by looking at total wages and bonuses paid in 2024. An average 2024 U.S. dollar exchange rate was applied to compensation reported in a foreign currency. After applying our CACM methodology and excluding the employees listed above, we identified the median employee.
Calculating the Pay Ratio
: As required by the SEC rules, we calculated our median employee’s total annual compensation in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K (which is the calculation method for reporting total compensation in the Summary Compensation Table). The total compensation of our median employee was $42,185.
With respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we annualized the compensation of Dr. Gitin (2024 base salary and annual bonus earned in respect of 2024 performance), who was appointed in June 2024, and otherwise included the amounts set forth for him in the Summary Compensation Table above. We determined that the 2024 annualized total compensation of our CEO was $7,064,479. As a result, the estimated ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to median employee in 2024 was approximately 167 to 1.
The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with rules promulgated by the SEC. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. Accordingly, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may use different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. This information is being provided solely for compliance with SEC disclosure rules. The Compensation Committee does not consider this ratio when evaluating compensation arrangements.

We provide cash compensation through retainers for Board and committee service, as well as additional cash retainers to the non-executive Chair of the Board and chairs of our standing Board committees. We do not provide Board and committee meeting fees. Compensating our directors in this manner simplifies the administration of our program and creates greater equality in rewarding service on committees of the Board. The additional retainers for Board or committee leadership compensate directors for the additional responsibilities and time commitments involved with chair responsibilities.
Following our annual meeting of stockholders in 2024, non-employee directors, received an equity award of service-based restricted stock units ("RSUs") with a value of approximately $250,000. The awards vest in a single installment on the earlier of the first anniversary of the date of grant or the next annual meeting of stockholders. 
Upon election to the Board, each new non-employee director receives a grant of approximately $250,000 in RSUs vesting on the first anniversary of the date of grant subject to the director’s continued service on the Board through the vesting date. If the election to the Board for a new director occurs other than at an annual meeting of stockholders, the subsequent annual equity grant is pro-rated based upon time the director served since first election. Any director who retires after at least eight years of service on the Board will be entitled to full vesting of all RSUs then held by the director. 
We pay for, provide or reimburse directors for expenses, including business class travel, incurred to attend Board and committee meetings and director education programs. We do not pay our non-employee directors any additional payments or perquisites. Our directors do not have a retirement plan. Directors who are also employees receive no additional compensation for service on the Board.

The amount reported is equal to the fair value of the RSU awards as of the grant date determined pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 ("ASC Topic 718") disregarding any estimates of forfeitures related to service-based vesting. The assumptions that we used with respect to the valuation of RSU awards are set forth in Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report.

The Company no longer grants stock options to non-employee directors. All previously-granted options were vested as of December 31, 2024.
Our Charter limits the dollar amount of personal liability of our directors for breaches by them of their fiduciary duties. Our Charter requires us to indemnify our directors to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"). We have also entered into indemnification agreements with all of our directors and we have purchased directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines
The Board adopted stock ownership guidelines to more closely align the interests of our directors with those of our long-term stockholders. Under the guidelines, non-employee directors are expected to maintain a minimum investment in our common stock of five times their annual cash Board retainers (excluding committee or leadership retainers).
Unvested time-based RSUs count toward required stock ownership levels; stock options (whether vested or unvested) do not. Ownership requirements are to be achieved no later than four years after the election as a director, except that prior to such time the director is expected to retain a certain portion of stock issued upon exercise of stock options or vesting of RSUs until the minimum ownership level is attained. All directors were in compliance with our stock ownership guidelines as of December 31, 2024.

The Board adopted a written related person transaction policy that requires the Audit Committee to approve or ratify any transaction or series of transactions exceeding $120,000 in which our Company is a participant and any related person has a direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or trustee or less than 10% owner of another entity) ("Related Party Transactions"). Related persons include our directors, director nominees and officers and their immediate family members and persons sharing their households. It also includes persons controlling more than 5% of our outstanding common stock. Subject to certain exceptions in the policy, related parties are required to notify the Audit Committee of the Related Party Transaction for an assessment of whether the transaction or proposed transaction should be permitted. Management also has established procedures for monitoring transactions that could be subject to approval or ratification under the Related Party Transactions policy. 
In deciding whether to approve or ratify the Related Party Transaction, the Audit Committee considers relevant facts and circumstances. The committee takes into account, among other factors, whether the transaction is on terms no more favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related person’s interest in the transaction. Once a Related Party Transaction has been identified, the Audit Committee reviews all of the relevant facts and circumstances and approves or disapproves entry into the transaction. Members of the Audit Committee having an interest in a transaction excuse themselves for the consideration and approval of the transaction in which they have an interest. Certain transactions are exempt from the policy including compensation paid by the Company for service as a director or an officer which is approved by the Compensation Committee or the Board. 
Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, we expect each of our directors to ensure that other existing and future commitments do not conflict with or materially interfere with his or her service as a director. In addition, directors are required to inform the chair of the NCGC and the Chair of the Board prior to joining the board of another public company to ensure that any potential conflicts, excessive time demands or other issues are carefully considered.

The Audit Committee reviewed and approved the following Related Party Transaction for 2024 in compliance with our policy: 
•
From time to time, certain institutional investors may become beneficial owners of 5% or more of the voting securities of the Company and, as a result, are considered a related person under the policy. These organizations may provide services to the Company or its benefit plans. In 2024, participants in our 401(k) Retirement Plan paid approximately $132,400 in fees to affiliates of The Vanguard Group representing expense ratios associated with the Vanguard investment funds in the 401(k) Retirement Plan.
On February 20, 2025, we entered into a Registration Rights Letter with The Valentin Gapontsev Trust I and The Valentin Gapontsev Trust III (the “Gapontsev Trusts”) pursuant to which we granted the Gapontsev Trusts certain registration rights relating to an aggregate of 2,150,000 shares of common stock held by the Gapontsev Trusts. The Gapontsev Trusts have agreed to pay all expenses of the registration of such shares pursuant to the Registration Rights Letter, including, without limitation, SEC filing fees and the fees and expenses of the Company’s counsel and independent registered public accountants and all underwriting discounts and selling commissions, if any and any other related legal expenses incurred by the Gapontsev Trusts.
Director Independence
Eight of our eleven directors are independent as defined by Nasdaq and SEC rules. Nasdaq listing standards governing independence require that a majority of the members of the Board be independent as defined by Nasdaq. Also, our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that a majority of the Board members be independent. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines also require that an independent director must have no material relationship with the Company, directly or indirectly, that might interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in the performance of director responsibilities. 
The NCGC conducted its annual review of the independence of the directors (and director nominees) in March 2024, taking into account relevant facts and circumstances, and reported its findings to the full Board. The NCGC determines independence on the basis of the standards specified by Nasdaq, the additional standards referenced in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and other facts and circumstances the Board considers relevant. During this review, the NCGC examined all direct and indirect transactions or relationships between the Company or any of its subsidiaries and each current independent director and any immediate family member of the independent director and determined that no material relationships with the Company existed during 2023 or to date in 2024. On the basis of this review, the NCGC determined that each of the following directors qualifies as an independent director as defined in Nasdaq guidelines, SEC rules and under our Corporate Governance Guidelines: Gregory Beecher, Michael Child, Jeanmarie Desmond, Kolleen Kennedy, Gregory Dougherty, Eric Meurice, John Peeler and Agnes Tang. Additionally, the Board determined that each member of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee meets the independence standards specific for members of such committees under Nasdaq guidelines and SEC rules. Dr. Mark Gitin, out CEO is not independent.  Ms. Pavlova is not considered independent because she is the spouse of Dr. Igor Samartsev, an executive officer of the Company.  Dr. Eugene Scherbakov is not considered independent because he served as an executive officer of the Company within the last three (3) years.

Fees for tax services consist of fees for tax compliance services and tax planning and advice services.

Policy on Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services. 
The Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. These services may include audit services, audit-related services and tax services as well as specifically designated non-audit services that, in the opinion of the Audit Committee, will not impair the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm. Pre-approval is generally provided for each fiscal year, and any pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and is generally subject to a specific budget. The independent registered public accounting firm and our management are required to periodically report to the Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with the pre-approval, including the fees for the services performed to date. In addition, the Audit Committee also may pre-approve particular services on a case-by-case basis, as required. All of the services performed by Deloitte & Touche LLP in 2024 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of IPG Photonics Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of IPG Photonics Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 20, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Excess or Obsolete Inventory Reserve: Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company evaluates inventory each reporting period for excess quantities and obsolescence, establishing reserves when necessary based upon historic usage, estimated future usage and age. Once recorded, these reserves are considered permanent adjustments to the carrying value of inventory. As of December 31, 2024, the Company has inventories of $284.8 million, net of excess quantities and obsolescence reserves. 
We identified the reserve for excess quantities and obsolete inventory as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management makes to quantify the reserve, including the determination of expected demand, especially when considering the vertically integrated nature of the Company's operations, as well as parts subject to technological obsolescence. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the policy and the reasonableness of assumptions including expected demand.
F-2
Table of Contents
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to management’s judgments underlying the calculation of excess or obsolete inventory reserve, included the following, among others:
•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over inventory, including those over the estimation of reserves for excess quantities and obsolescence.
•
We evaluated the reasonableness of the Company's excess and obsolete reserve policy, considering historical experience and the underlying assumptions.
•
We tested the calculation of the excess and obsolete reserve pursuant to the Company’s policy, including the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the calculation.
•
We evaluated management’s ability to estimate future demand by comparing actual inventory usage to estimates made in prior years.
•
We considered the existence of contradictory evidence based on consideration of internal communication to management and the board of directors, Company press releases, and analysts’ reports, as well as any changes within the business.

IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(In thousands, except share and per share data)
1. 
NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Nature of Business
 — IPG Photonics Corporation (the "Company" or "IPG") develops, manufactures and sells high-performance fiber lasers, fiber amplifiers, and diode lasers that are used for diverse applications, primarily in materials processing. The Company was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in December 1998. Its world headquarters is located in Marlborough, Massachusetts. It also has facilities and sales offices elsewhere in North and South America, Europe and Asia.
Principles of Consolidation
 — The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
 — The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Foreign Currency
 — The financial information for entities outside the United States is measured using local currencies as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the respective balance sheet dates. Income and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars based on the average rate of exchange for the corresponding period. Exchange rate differences resulting from translation adjustments are accounted for directly as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments
 — Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments, such as money market fund deposits, commercial paper, U.S. government and government agency, term deposits, and corporate bonds with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase with insignificant interest rate risk. Short-term investments consist of liquid investments including commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S. government and government agency notes and term deposits with original maturities of greater than three months but less than one year with insignificant interest rate risk. Fixed-term securities included in cash equivalents and short-term investments are held-to-maturity and accounted for at amortized cost.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses
 — Accounts receivable include $
26,361
 and $
17,313
 of bank acceptance drafts at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Bank acceptance drafts are bank guarantees of payment on specified dates. The weighted average maturity of these bank acceptance drafts is approximately 
101
 days. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses to provide for the estimated amount of accounts receivable that will not be collected. The allowance is based upon an estimate of expected credit losses over the life of outstanding receivables. The estimate involves an assessment of customer creditworthiness, historical payment experience, an assumption of future expected credit losses, and the age of outstanding receivables.
Activity related to the allowance for credit losses was as follows:

Inventories
 — Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventories include parts and components that may be specialized in nature and subject to obsolescence. The Company periodically reviews the quantities and carrying values of inventories to assess whether the inventories are recoverable. The costs associated with provisions for excess quantities, technological obsolescence, or scrap related to out of specification components are charged to cost of sales as incurred.
Business Combination 
— The fair value of the consideration exchanged in a business combination is allocated to tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at acquisition date fair value. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The 
F-9
Table of Contents
IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(In thousands, except share and per share data)
accounting for an acquisition involves a considerable amount of judgment and estimation. Cost, income, market or a combination of approaches may be used to establish the fair value of consideration exchanged, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, depending on the nature of those items. The valuation approach is determined in accordance with generally accepted valuation methods. Key areas of estimation and judgment may include the selection of valuation approaches, cost of capital, market characteristics, cost structure, impacts of synergies, and estimates of terminal value, among other factors.
The Company's estimates and assumptions used as part of the purchase price allocation process are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon conclusion of the measurement period, or final determination of the value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to results of operations.
Goodwill —
 Goodwill is the amount by which the cost of the acquired net assets in a business acquisition exceeded the fair values of the net identifiable assets on the date of purchase. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying value of goodwill. If the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess. The results of the goodwill assessments for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are discussed in Note 8, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets."

Intangible Assets
 — Intangible assets result from the Company's various business acquisitions. Intangible assets are reported at cost, less accumulated amortization, and are amortized on a straight-line basis either over their estimated useful lives of 
one year
 to 
thirteen years
 or over the period the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed.
Property, Plant and Equipment
 — Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is determined using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets. In the case of leasehold improvements, the estimated useful lives of the related assets do not exceed the remaining terms of the corresponding leases. 
The following table presents the assigned economic useful lives of property, plant and equipment:

Economic Useful Life
Buildings

20
-
30
 years
Machinery and equipment

5
-
10
 years
Office furniture and fixtures

-

 years
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expenses when they are incurred. The estimated useful life of certain machinery and equipment was increased from 
7
 years to 
10
 years based upon the Company's experience of historical usage. The change in estimate did not have a material effect in 2024.
Long-Lived Assets
 — Long-lived assets, which consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, identifiable intangible assets and right-of-use ("ROU") assets, are reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets.
 The impact of the long-lived assets impairment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are discussed in Note 5, "Divestiture, Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Sale of Assets." 
Included in other long-term assets is certain demonstration equipment. The demonstration equipment is amortized over the respective estimated economic lives, generally 
3
 years. The carrying value of the demonstration equipment totaled $
5,480
 and $
3,726
 at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Amortization expense of demonstration equipment for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, was $
3,111
, $
3,480
 and $
2,387
, respectively.
Authorized Capital
 — The Company has authorized capital stock consisting of 
175,000,000
 shares of common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share, and 
5,000,000
 shares of preferred stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share. There are 
no
 shares of preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2024.

Revenue Recognition 
— Revenue is recognized when transfer of control to the customer occurs in an amount reflecting the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled. In order to achieve this core principle, the Company applies the 
F-10
Table of Contents
IPG PHOTONICS CORPORATION
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(In thousands, except share and per share data)
following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.
The Company considers customer purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master sales agreements, to be contracts with a customer. As part of its consideration of the contract, the Company evaluates certain factors including the customer's ability to pay (or credit risk). For each contract, the Company considers the promise to transfer products, each of which is identified as a distinct performance obligation. In determining the transaction price, the Company evaluates whether the price is subject to refund or adjustment to determine the net consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. As the Company's standard payment terms are less than one year, the Company has elected the practical expedient under ASC 606-10-32-18 to not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price.
The Company often receives orders with the customer's schedule of delivery dates for products that may extend across several reporting periods. The Company allocates the transaction price of the contract to each delivery based on the product standalone selling price. As scheduled delivery dates are generally within 
one year
, under the optional exemption provided by ASC 606-10-50-14 revenues allocated to future shipments of partially completed contracts are not disclosed.
Rights of return are not generally included in customer contracts. Returns are infrequent and are recorded as a reduction of revenue.
In certain subsidiaries the Company provides sales commissions to sales representatives based on sales volume. The Company has determined that the incentive portion of its sales commissions qualify as contract costs. The Company has elected the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4 to expense sales commissions when incurred as the amortization period of the asset that would otherwise have been recognized is one year or less.
Revenue Recognition at a Point in Time 
—

Revenues recognized at a point in time consist primarily of product, installation and service sales. The Company recognizes revenue for laser and spare part sales following the transfer of control of such products to the customer, which typically occurs upon shipment or delivery depending on the terms of the underlying contracts. Installation revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation service, which typically occurs within 
90
 days of delivery. When sales contracts contain multiple performance obligations, such as the shipment or delivery of products and installation, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in the contract based on relative standalone selling prices and recognizes the related revenue as control of each individual product or service is transferred to the customer, in satisfaction of the corresponding performance obligations.
Revenue Recognition over Time 
— The Company offers extended warranty agreements, which extend the standard warranty periods. Extended warranties are sold separately from products and represent a distinct performance obligation. Revenue related to the performance obligation for extended warranties is recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Company. The customer receives the assurance that the product will operate in accordance with agreed-upon specifications evenly during the extended warranty period regardless of whether they make a claim during that period, and therefore, revenue at time of sale is deferred and recognized over the time period of the extended warranty period.
The Company enters into contracts to sell customized large scale materials processing systems through its subsidiary Genesis Systems Group, LLC, for which revenue is generally recognized over time, depending on the terms of the contract. Recognizing revenue over time for these contracts is based on the Company’s judgment that the customized large scale materials processing systems do not have an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.  
The determination of the revenue to be recognized in a given period for performance obligations over time is based on the input method.  The Company generally uses the total cost-to-cost input method of progress because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as costs are incurred. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. 
Customer Deposits and Deferred Revenue

—

When the Company receives consideration from a customer or such consideration is unconditionally due prior to transferring goods or services under the terms of a sales contract, the Company

records customer deposits or deferred revenue, which represent contract liabilities. The Company recognizes deferred revenue as net sales after control of the goods or services has been transferred to the customer and all revenue recognition criteria are met.

Warranties
 — The Company typically provides 
one
 to 
five-year
 warranties on lasers and amplifiers. Warranties are limited and provide that the product meets specifications and is free from defects in materials and workmanship. Most of the Company's sales offices provide support to customers in their respective geographic areas. The Company estimates the warranty accrual considering past claims experience, the number of units still covered by warranty and the average life of the remaining warranty period. The warranty accrual has generally been sufficient to cover product warranty repair and replacement costs.

Stock-based Compensation
 — The Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense using the fair value of the awards granted. The Company issues equity incentive awards in the form of time-based restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance-based restricted stock units ("PSUs"). The fair value for RSUs is based on the closing share price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. PSUs are aligned to specified performance targets such as financial metrics or the relative return of the Company's common stock compared to an index ("TSR PSUs"). The fair value of PSUs aligned to specified financial performance metrics is determined based on the number of units expected to vest upon achievement of the performance conditions. The fair value for TSR PSUs is based on a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation as an expense on a straight-line basis, over the requisite service period. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur. 
The Company has an employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP") offered to its U.S. and German employees. The Company uses the Black-Scholes model to calculate the purchase date fair value of the shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan and recognize expense related to shares purchased ratably over the offering period. The description of the Company's stock-based compensation plans and the assumptions it uses to calculate the fair value of stock-based compensation is described in Note 15, "Stock-based Compensation."
Advertising Expense
 — The cost of advertising is expensed as incurred. The Company conducts substantially all of its sales and marketing efforts through trade shows, professional and technical conferences, direct sales and the Company's website. The Company's advertising costs were not material for the periods presented.
Research and Development
 — Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Restructuring 
— The Company records charges associated with approved restructuring plans to reorganize operations, to remove redundant headcount and infrastructure associated with business acquisitions or to improve the efficiency of business processes.  Restructuring charges can include severance costs to eliminate a specific number of positions, infrastructure charges to vacate facilities and consolidate operations and contract cancellation costs. The Company records restructuring charges when they are probable and estimable. The Company accrues for severance and other employee separation costs under these plans when the plan is communicated to employees and an amount per employee can be reasonably estimated either by the communicated terms, or by legal requirements, if applicable. The results of a restructuring program completed during the year ended December 31, 2023 are discussed in Note 6, "Restructuring."

Income Taxes
 — Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and credit carryforwards. These differences are valued using enacted rates in effect when those differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets that are not deemed to be recoverable. The Company recognizes tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The tax positions are measured at the greatest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.
The Company provides reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other issues. The reserves are based on a determination of whether a tax benefit claimed in its tax filings is more likely than not to be realized following the resolution of any potential tax audits related to the tax benefit, assuming that the matter in question will be reviewed by the tax authorities.
Concentration of Credit Risk
 — Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. The Company maintains substantially all of its cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in various financial institutions, which it believes to be high-

credit quality financial institutions. The Company grants credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and provides a reserve for potential credit losses. Such losses historically have been within management's expectations.
One of the Company's customers accounted for 
12
% and

Derivative Instruments
 — The Company's primary market exposures are to interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company from time to time may use certain derivative financial instruments to help manage these exposures. The Company executes these instruments with financial institutions it judges to be credit-worthy. The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
(Losses) Earnings Per Share
 — Basic net (loss) income per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders of the Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per common share is computed similarly to basic net income per common share, 
F-13
Table of Contents

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(In thousands, except share and per share data)
except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were exercised. Information about potentially dilutive and antidilutive shares for the reporting period is provided in Note 18, "Net (Loss) Income Attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation Per Share."

Leases
 — The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in other assets, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and other long-term liabilities and deferred income taxes on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. As most of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, IPG uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The ROU assets include any lease payments made and initial direct costs incurred and exclude lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease component.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Adopted Pronouncements
 —

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures" ("ASU 2023-07"), which improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses on an annual and interim basis. Under the new guidance an entity is required to disclose the title and position of the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU also requires that an entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by this ASU and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company has adopted ASU 2023-07. Refer to Note 19, "Segment Reporting."
Pronouncements Currently Under Evaluation
 —

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures" ("ASU 2023-07"), which requires an entity on an annual basis to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. The guidance also requires an entity to disclose on an annual basis information about income taxes paid. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU and does not expect this standard will have a material impact on the Company's disclosures.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, "Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Aggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)" ("ASU 2024-03"), which requires more detailed disaggregated disclosure of  income statement expenses.  ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027. The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU and does not expect this standard will have a material impact.

The Company recognizes revenue over time on contracts for the sale of large scale materials processing systems. The timing of customer payments on these contracts generally differs from the timing of revenue recognized. If revenue recognized exceeds customer payments, a contract asset is recorded and if customer payments exceed revenue recognized, a contract liability is recorded. Contract assets are included within prepaid expense and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Contract liabilities are included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain deferred revenues related to extended warranties in excess of one year from the balance sheet date are included within other long-term liabilities and deferred income taxes on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The Company's financial instruments consisted of cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and revolving lines of credit.
The valuation techniques used to measure fair value are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect internal market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. The Company classifies its financial instruments according to the prescribed criteria.  
The carrying amounts of money market fund deposits, cash equivalent term deposits, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and revolving lines of credit are considered reasonable estimates of their fair market value due to the short maturity of most of these instruments or as a result of the competitive market interest rates, which have been negotiated. The fair value of the Company's commercial paper, U.S. Treasury and agency obligations, term deposits, and corporate bonds are based on Level 2 inputs.

DIVESTITURE, IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND SALE OF ASSETS
During the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a loss on divestiture of $
197,651
, which was included in Net loss (gain) from divestiture and sale of assets in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and related sanctions, the Company's ability to ship and receive components from its Russian operations was significantly curtailed. On August 29, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its Russian subsidiary, pursuant to a share purchase agreement with a purchaser entity associated with Softline Projects LLC and existing management of IRE-Polus for $
51,096
. The loss mainly consisted of $

135,346
 related to the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income that was previously included in stockholders' equity of the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
During the third quarter of 2024, the Company evaluated its Belarusian operations. On June 29, 2024, the European Union (“EU”) issued new sanctions for Belarus. The sanctions, effective July 1 2024, allowed shipments to the Company's German operations related to existing contracts to continue through October 2, 2024. The Company completed fulfillment of existing contracts in September 2024. The Company is no longer able to supply laser cabinets and other mechanical components from the Company's factory in Belarus. As a result, the Company completed an impairment analysis of the assets in Belarus during the third quarter of 2024. The Company recorded $
26,566
 of impairment of long-lived assets, primarily fixed assets that was included in the total impairment of long-lived assets of $
27,006
 in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The long-lived asset impairment charge was based on a probability-weighted average of valuations using the discounted cash flow method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of the long-lived assets in Belarus. 
During the third quarter of 2022, the Company completed the sale of its telecommunications transmission product line for $
56,222
. The Company recorded a gain on divestiture of $

2,500
.
During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company completed the sale of its corporate aircraft for $
25,693
 and recorded a gain of $
9,928
 which was included in Net loss (gain) from divestiture and sale of assets in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operation. The Company also completed an impairment analysis of assets in Russia during the fourth quarter of 2022 and recorded $
79,030
 of impairment of long-lived assets which was included in Impairment of long-lived assets in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The long-lived asset impairment charge was based on a probability-weighted average of valuations using the discounted cash flow method under the income approach, the guideline public company method and the guideline transaction method under the market approach, to estimate the fair value of the long-lived assets in Russia.
6. 
RESTRUCTURING
In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company implemented a restructuring program at its Russian subsidiary. In 2023, the Company substantially completed the restructuring program. As a result, the remaining restructuring accrual was reversed

FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS
Revolving Line of Credit Facilities:
The Company maintains an unsecured revolving line of credit with a principal amount of $
75,000
, expiring in April 2025. The line of credit bears interest at a variable rate of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") plus 
0.90
% to 
1.60
% depending on the Company's financial performance. Part of this credit facility is available to the Company's foreign subsidiaries including those in India, China, Japan and Brazil based on management discretion. At December 31, 2024, there were 
no
 outstanding drawings, however, there were $
2,103
 of guarantees issued against the line which reduced the total availability. At December 31, 2024, the remaining availability under this line was $
72,897
. In addition, the Company maintains Euro line of credit facilities with a total principal amount of €
6,500
 ($
6,751
 as of December 31, 2024), which are available to certain European subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024 there were 
no
 amounts drawn on the Euro lines of credit, and there were $
1,533
 of guarantees issued against the facility, which reduce the amount of the facility available to draw.
The Company is required to meet certain financial covenants associated with its U.S. revolving line of credit and long-term debt facility. These covenants, tested quarterly, include an interest coverage ratio and a funded debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") ratio. The interest coverage covenant requires that the Company maintains a trailing twelve-month ratio of EBITDA to interest on all obligations that is at least 
3.0
:1.0. The funded debt to EBITDA covenant requires that the sum of all indebtedness for borrowed money on a consolidated basis be less than 
three
 times its trailing twelve months EBITDA. Funded debt is decreased by its cash and available marketable securities not classified as long-term investments in the U.S. in excess of $
50,000
 up to a maximum of $
500,000
.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Employment Agreements
 — The Company has entered into employment agreements with certain members of senior management. The terms of these agreements are up to 
two years
 and include non-competition, non-solicitation and nondisclosure provisions, as well as provisions for defined severance for terminations of employment under certain conditions and a change of control of the Company. The Company also maintains a severance plan for certain of its senior management providing for defined severance for terminations of employment under certain conditions and a change of control of the Company.
Contractual Obligations
 — The Company has entered into various purchase obligations that include agreements for construction of buildings, raw materials and equipment. Obligations under these agreements were $
71,238
 and $
27,404
 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and the obligations related to raw materials and equipment are generally expected to be fulfilled within one year.
Legal Proceedings
 — From time to time, the Company may be involved in legal disputes and other proceedings in the ordinary course of its business. These matters may include allegations of infringement of intellectual property, commercial disputes and employment matters. As of December 31, 2024, management believes these matters will not have a material effect, either individually or in the aggregate, on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
In December 2024, affiliates of Trumpf SE & Co. KG (“Trumpf”) filed patent lawsuits in two different Unified Patent Courts located in Germany against IPG Laser GmbH & Co. KG alleging infringement of two patents granted by the European Patent Office by the Company's adjustable mode beam (AMB) lasers. The Company's AMB lasers are used in the welding of electric vehicle batteries as well as structural welding.  The matter is still in its early stages and the Company intends to defend it vigorously. No loss was deemed probable at December 31, 2024 and therefore no amounts have been accrued in respect of this contingency. 
As of December 31, 2024 and through the date of the Company's subsequent review period of February 20, 2025, the Company is aware of 
no
 other ongoing legal proceedings that management estimates could have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Incentive Plans
 — In 2006, the Company's stockholders approved the 2006 Incentive Compensation Plan (as amended and restated from time to time, the "2006 Plan"), which provides for the issuance of stock options, PSUs, RSUs, other equity-based awards and cash awards to the Company's directors, employees, consultants and advisors. Also in 2006, the Company's stockholders approved the Non-Employee Directors Stock Plan (the "Directors Plan") for non-employee directors, which was subsequently merged into the 2006 Plan. The Company's stockholders approved amendments to the 2006 Plan in May 2006 and May 2023, including an increase in the authorized shares. A total of 
11,479,192
 shares are reserved under the 2006 Plan. At December 31, 2024, 
2,205,922
 shares of the Company's stock were available for future grant under the 2006 Plan. The Company may grant stock options only at an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair market value of its common stock on the date of grant. Equity awards generally vest over periods of 
one
 to 
three years
 and, in the case of stock options, generally expire 
ten years
 after the date of the grant. The vesting of awards under the 2006 Plan accelerate following the occurrence of certain change of control events if the participant's employment is terminated within 
two years
 by the Company without cause or by the participant for good reason or if an entity acquires control of the Company and does not agree to assume existing awards or replace with equivalent value awards. Awards granted to non-employee directors automatically become vested upon a change of control. All shares issued under the 2006 Plan are registered shares, newly issued by the Company.
The Company granted certain RSUs and PSUs to executive officers and other senior managers. The RSUs provide for time-based vesting of a fixed number of shares generally over 
three years
. The PSUs provide the holder with the right to receive shares of the Company's common stock after the applicable award vesting period, generally 
three years
. The final number of shares, if any, delivered upon vesting of PSUs are determined over the relevant performance period, generally 
three years
. Outstanding PSUs as of December 31, 2024 are based on financial metrics. In the case of TSR PSUs, performance was measured by the Company's total shareholder return over the performance period compared to the S&P 1500 Composite / Electronic Equipment & Instruments Index. In the case of all other PSUs, performance is measured against internal financial metrics established by the Company's Board. The final number of shares to be delivered under the PSUs range from 
0
% to 
200
% of the target award amount.

The Company accrues taxes on dividend distributions to the extent that foreign subsidiaries have cash in excess of their operational needs.  The Company has recorded $
3,360
 and $
1,504
 as a deferred tax liability on December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, for certain withholding and dividend taxes related to possible future distributions of excess cash from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to their respective parent companies. In both 2024 and 2023, the German subsidiary paid a dividend to the U.S. parent company of $
80,282
 and $
107,941
, respectively. There were no federal or withholding taxes due on the distributions from Germany to the U.S., but in both years the Company accrued a nominal amount of state tax relating to the distribution. 
With regard to the other non-U.S. subsidiaries, the Company continues to consider the earnings from these entities to be indefinitely reinvested to the extent the cash balance in each subsidiary is not greater than the current needs for operations and expansion. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the cumulative undistributed earnings in non-U.S. subsidiaries were approximately  $
687,579
 and $
944,867
, respectively, and excluded earnings for possible future distributions for which tax has been accrued.  Of the $
257,288
 decrease in cumulative undistributed earnings in non-U.S. subsidiaries in 2024, $
172,878
 relates to the sale of the Company's Russian operations. 
In determining the Company’s 2024 and 2023 tax provisions, the Company calculated the deferred tax assets and liabilities for each separate tax entity. The Company then considered a number of factors including the positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance should be recognized with respect to the deferred tax assets. 
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had state tax credit carryforwards (net of federal tax effect) of $
24,133
 and $
20,704
, respectively. The state tax credit carryforwards begin expiring in 2025. The Company has determined that some of the state credits will more likely than not expire before they can be used and has recorded a valuation allowance of $
21,425
 and $
17,996
 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
The Company has tax loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions totaling $
46,486
 and $
25,747
 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company believes it is more likely than not that most of the loss carryforwards will expire before they can be used and has provided a valuation allowance against the tax benefit of the losses in foreign jurisdictions of $
11,484
 and $
6,952
 at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company sold its Russian subsidiary in 2024 which decreased the valuation allowance on Russian deferred tax assets by $
23,873
. There are no significant valuation allowances against other deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024.
The Company provides reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other issues. Reserves recorded are based on a determination of the amount of a tax benefit taken by the Company that is more likely than not to be realized, assuming that the matter in question will be reviewed by the tax authorities.

SEGMENT REPORTING
The Company operates in 
one
 segment which involves the design, development, production and distribution of fiber lasers, laser and non-laser systems, fiber amplifiers, and related optical components. The Company has a single, company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than as discrete operating segments. The CODM, who is the Company's chief executive officer, measures financial performance as a single enterprise, and not on geography, legal entity, or end market basis. Throughout the year, the chief operating decision maker allocates capital resources on a project-by-project basis across the Company's entire asset base, as reflected in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets, to maximize profitability without regard to geography, legal entity, or end market basis. The Company operates in a number of countries throughout the world in a variety of product lines. Information regarding product lines and geographic financial information is provided in Note 2, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" and Note 9, "Property, Plant and Equipment." The accounting policies used in the Company's segment reporting are the same as those described in Note 1, "Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies."

In evaluating the Net (loss) income attributable to IPG Photonics Corporation common stockholders, the CODM also reviews gross profit as well the Company's (loss) income before foreign exchange and other segment items to set and evaluate performance targets.
