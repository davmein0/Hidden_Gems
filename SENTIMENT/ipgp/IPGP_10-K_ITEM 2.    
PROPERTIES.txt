Our corporate headquarters is in Marlborough, Massachusetts. As of December 31, 2024, we occupied more than 2.8 million square feet of facilities worldwide. Of this we own 2.4 million square feet and lease 0.4 million square feet of building space, of which the majority is used for manufacturing. Our major manufacturing facilities are located in the United States and Germany. We have ceased new investments in our Belarusian operations. We have and will continue to expand our manufacturing operations in Germany and the United States, in part to replace the lost capacity at our factories in Russia and Belarus due to sanctions, to meet the demand for our products and our sales and support needs. We conduct our major research and development activities in Oxford and Marlborough, Massachusetts and Burbach, Germany. 
We own additional facilities and land for various purposes, such as sales and support and applications labs. We believe the existing facilities are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of our operations.
