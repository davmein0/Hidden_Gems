As of February 6, 2025, there were approximately 2,069 shareholders of record of the Company’s common stock.
Dividends on Common Stock
The Company’s Board of Directors approved the first semi-annual dividend on the Company’s common stock in January 2000 and continued to approve a semi-annual dividend until quarterly dividends were approved starting in 2014. The payment of dividends is subject to statutory restrictions and restrictions arising under the terms of the Company's Fixed-to-Floating Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series D (the “Series D Preferred Stock”), the terms of the Company’s Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series E (the “Series E Preferred Stock”), the terms of the Company’s Trust Preferred Securities offerings and under certain financial covenants in the Company’s revolving and term credit facilities. Under the terms of these separate revolving and term credit facilities, the Company is prohibited from paying dividends on any equity interests, including its common stock and preferred stock, if such payments would cause the Company to be in default under its credit facilities or exceed a certain threshold.
The following is a summary of the cash dividends paid in 2024 and 2023:

On January 23, 2025, Wintrust Financial Corporation announced that the Company’s Board of Directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share of outstanding common stock. The dividend was paid on February 20, 2025 to shareholders of record as of February 6, 2025.
The final determination of timing, amount and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and will depend on the Company’s earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other relevant factors. Because the Company’s consolidated net income consists largely of net income of the banks and certain wealth management subsidiaries, the Company’s ability to pay dividends generally depends upon its receipt of dividends from these entities. The Company’s and the banks’ ability to pay dividends is subject to banking laws, regulations and policies. See “Supervision and Regulation - Payment of Dividends and Share Repurchases” in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, the banks and certain wealth management subsidiaries paid $475.0 million, $360.0 million and $52.0 million, respectively, in dividends to the Company.
Reference is also made to Note (19) “Regulatory Matters” to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of the restrictions on the ability of certain subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Company in the form of dividends.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Our previously authorized share repurchase program permitted the repurchase of up to $125 million of our common stock. On October 28, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of the Company’s outstanding shares of common stock. This authorization is incremental to the remaining authorization of approximately $23 million under the previous program, which the Board approved in 2019. The repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date. No purchases of the Company’s common shares were made by or on behalf of the Company or any “affiliated purchaser” as defined in Rule 10b-18(a)(3) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024.

See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures/Ratios” for additional information on this performance measure/ratio.
(2)
Net revenue is net interest income plus non-interest income.
(3)
The net overhead ratio is calculated by netting total non-interest expense and total non-interest income and dividing by that period’s total average assets. A lower ratio indicates a higher degree of efficiency.
Please refer to the Consolidated Results of Operations section later in this discussion for an analysis of the Company’s operations for the past three years.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES/RATIOS
The accounting and reporting policies of Wintrust conform to generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP performance measures and ratios are used by management to evaluate and measure the Company’s performance. These include taxable-equivalent net interest income (including its individual components), taxable-equivalent net interest margin (including its individual components), the taxable-equivalent efficiency ratio, tangible common equity ratio, tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible common equity and pre-tax income, excluding provision for credit losses. Management believes that these measures and ratios provide users of the Company’s financial information a more meaningful view of the performance of the Company’s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and of the Company’s operating efficiency. Other financial holding companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios differently.
Management reviews yields on certain asset categories and the net interest margin of the Company and its banking subsidiaries on a fully taxable-equivalent (“FTE”) basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis using tax rates effective as of the end of the period. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. Net interest income on a FTE basis is also used in the calculation of the Company’s efficiency ratio. The efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing non-interest expense by total taxable-equivalent net revenue (less securities gains or losses), measures how much it costs to produce one dollar of revenue. Securities gains or losses are excluded from this calculation to better match revenue from daily operations to operational expenses. Management considers the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share as useful measurements of the Company’s equity. The Company references the return on average tangible common equity as a measurement of profitability. Management considers pre-tax income, excluding provision for credit losses as a useful measurement of the Company’s core net income.

OVERVIEW AND STRATEGY
2024 Highlights
The Company recorded net income of $695.0 million for the year of 2024 compared to $622.6 million and $509.7 million for the years of 2023 and 2022, respectively. The results for 2024 demonstrate increased net interest income primarily due to increased growth in earning assets, as well as increased wealth management revenue and mortgage banking revenues as a result of a favorable fair value adjustments of MSRs, net of servicing hedge, and an increase in loans originated for sale, partially offset by payoffs, paydowns and repurchases of the existing portfolio.
The Company increased its loan portfolio from $42.1 billion at December 31, 2023 to $48.1 billion at December 31, 2024. This increase was primarily due to growth in several portfolios, including the commercial, industrial and other, commercial real estate, property and casualty premium finance receivables, and residential real estate portfolios. For more information regarding changes in the Company’s loan portfolio, see “Analysis of Financial Condition – Interest Earning Assets” and Note (4) “Loans” to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company recorded net interest income of $2.0 billion in 2024 compared to $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The higher level of net interest income recorded in 2024 compared to 2023 resulted primarily from a $5.7 billion increase in average earning assets partially offset by a 15 basis point decline in the net interest margin in 2024 (see “Net Interest Margin” section later in this Item 7 for further detail).
Non-interest income totaled $488.3 million in 2024, increasing $54.2 million, or 12%, compared to 2023. The increase in non-interest income in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily attributable to a $20.0 million gain recognized in the first quarter of 2024 related to the sale of the Company’s Retirement Benefits Advisors (“RBA”) division within its wealth management business and an increase in mortgage banking revenues as a result of favorable fair value adjustments of 
MS
Rs, net of servicing hedge, and an increase in loans originated for sale, partially offset by payoffs, paydowns and repurchases of the existing portfolio (see “Non-Interest Income” section later in this Item 7 for further detail). 
Non-interest expense totaled $1.4 billion in 2024, increasing $90.2 million, or 7%, compared to 2023. The increase compared to 2023 was primarily attributable to an $69.1 million increase in salary and employee benefits expense and a $18.2 million increase in software and equipment expense (see “Non-Interest Expense” section later in this Item 7 for further detail).
Management considers the maintenance of adequate liquidity to be important to the management of risk. Accordingly, during 2024, the Company continued its practice of maintaining appropriate funding capacity to provide the Company with adequate liquidity for its ongoing operations. In this regard, the Company benefited from its strong deposit base, a liquid investment portfolio and its access to funding from a variety of external funding sources.  The Company had overnight liquid funds and interest-bearing deposits with banks of $4.9 billion and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
Economic Environment
The economic environment in 2024 included the return of a more normal shaped yield curve that is no longer inverted as the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee pivoted to reduce short term interest rates in the second half of 2024. Additionally, overall economic forecasts improved resulting in favorable credit trends for banks.  The Company has employed certain strategies to manage net income in the current environment, including those discussed below.
Net Interest Income
The Company has leveraged its operating strengths to grow its earning assets base while maintaining a stable net interest margin in 2024. In 2024, the Company's net interest margin decreased to 3.51% (3.53% on a fully tax-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) as compared to 3.66% (3.68% on a fully tax-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) in 2023, primarily due to increased deposit competition following bank failures in 2023. Significant growth in earning assets resulted in the Company’s net interest income increasing by $124.7 million in 2024 compared to 2023. Based on contractual terms, approximately 74% of our current loan balances are projected to reprice or mature in 2025. The magnitude of potential changes in net interest income in various interest rate scenarios has continued to remain relatively neutral. As the current interest rate cycle progressed, management took action to reposition its sensitivity to interest rates. To this end, management has executed various derivative instruments including collars and receive-fixed swaps to hedge variable-rate loan exposures. The Company will continue to monitor current and projected interest rates and may execute additional derivatives to mitigate potential fluctuations in the net interest margin in future periods.
52
The Company has continued its practice of writing call options against certain investment securities to economically hedge the securities positions and receive fee income to compensate for net interest margin compression. In 2024, the Company recognized $10.2 million in fees on covered call options compared to $21.9 million in 2023. 
The Company utilizes “back to back” interest rate derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps, to receive floating rate interest payments related to customer loans.  In these arrangements, the Company makes a floating rate loan to a borrower who prefers to pay a fixed rate. To accommodate the risk management strategy of certain qualified borrowers, the Company enters a swap with its borrower to effectively convert the borrower's variable rate loan to a fixed rate.  However, in order to minimize the Company's exposure on these transactions and continue to receive a floating rate, the Company simultaneously executes an offsetting mirror-image swap with various third parties.    
Non-Interest Income
The interest rate environment impacts the profitability and mix of the Company’s mortgage banking business which generated revenues of $93.2 million in 2024 and $83.1 million in 2023, representing 4% of total net revenue in both 2024 and 2023.  Mortgage banking revenue is primarily comprised of gains on sales of mortgage loans originated for new home purchases as well as mortgage refinancing. 
Mortgage revenue is also impacted by changes in the fair value of MS
Rs and EBOs guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. Mortgage originations for sale totaled  $2.6 billion and $2.0 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively. In 2024, approximately 75% of originations were mortgages associated with new home purchases, while 25% of originations were related to refinancing of mortgages. In 2023, approximately 83% of originations were mortgages associated with new home purchases, while 17% of originations were related to refinancing of mortgages. 

Non-Interest Expense
Management believes expense management is important to enhance profitability amid increased competition.  Cost control and an efficient infrastructure should position the Company appropriately as it continues its growth strategy. Management continues to be disciplined in its approach to growth and plans to leverage the Company's existing expense infrastructure to expand its presence in existing and complimentary markets. Potentially impacting the cost control strategies discussed above, the Company anticipates increased costs resulting from the regulatory environment in which we operate as well as wage inflation, higher FDIC insurance assessments and continued investment in technology. 
Credit Quality
The Company continues to actively address non-performing assets and remains disciplined in its approach to grow without sacrificing asset quality. 
In particular:

•
The Company’s 2024 provision for credit losses totaled $101.0 million compared to a provision of $114.4 million in 2023 and a provision of $78.6 million in 2022. The lower provision in 2024 was primarily the result of improvements in the macroeconomic forecast, specifically the Company’s macroeconomic forecasts of key model inputs (most notably, Commercial Real Estate Price Index and Baa corporate credit spreads) despite growth in the Company's loan portfolios. Net charge-offs increased to $94.4 million in 2024 (of which $67.8 million related to commercial and commercial real estate loans), compared to $45.5 million in 2023 (of which $27.8 million related to commercial and commercial real estate loans) and $20.3 million in 2022 (of which $10.1 million related to commercial and commercial real estate loans).
•
The Company's allowance for loan and unfunded lending-related commitment losses increased to $436.6 million at December 31, 2024, reflecting an increase of $9.3 million, or 2%, when compared to 2023. At December 31, 2024, approximately $222.9 million, or 51%, of the allowance for loan and unfunded lending-related commitment losses was associated with commercial real estate loans and an additional $175.8 million, or 40%, was associated with commercial loans.  
•
The Company has significant exposure to commercial real estate. At December 31, 2024, $12.9 billion, or 27%, of our loan portfolio was commercial real estate, with approximately 68.5% located in our market area. The commercial real estate loan portfolio was comprised of $2.4 billion in construction and development loans, and $10.5 billion in non-construction loans. In analyzing the commercial real estate market, the Company does not rely upon the assessment of broad market statistical data, in large part because the Company’s market area is diverse and covers many communities, each of which is impacted differently by economic forces affecting the Company’s general market area. As such, the extent of the decline in real estate valuations can vary meaningfully among the different types of commercial and other 
53
real estate loans made by the Company. The Company uses its multi-chartered structure and local management knowledge to analyze and manage the local market conditions at each of its banks. 
•
Excluding early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, total non-performing loans (loans on non-accrual status and loans more than 90 days past due and still accruing interest) were $170.8 million (of which $21.0 million, or 12%
, 
was related to commercial real estate) at December 31, 2024, an increase of $31.8 million compared to December 31, 2023. Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans were 0.36% at December 31, 2024 compared to 0.33% at December 31, 2023.
•
The Company’s other real estate owned increased by $9.8 million to $23.1 million during 2024, from $13.3 million at December 31, 2023. The $23.1 million of other real estate owned as of December 31, 2024 was comprised entirely of commercial real estate property.
During 2024, management continued its efforts to aggressively resolve problem loans through liquidation, rather than retention of loans or real estate acquired as collateral through the foreclosure process. Management believes these actions will serve the Company well in the future by providing some protection for the Company from further valuation deterioration and permitting management to spend less time on resolution of problem loans and more time on growing the Company’s core business and the evaluation of other opportunities. 
The Company enters into residential mortgage loan sale agreements with investors in the normal course of business. The Company’s practice is generally not to retain long-term fixed-rate mortgages on its balance sheet in order to mitigate interest rate risk, and consequently sells most of such mortgages into the secondary market. These agreements provide recourse to investors through certain representations concerning credit information, loan documentation, collateral and insurability. Investors request the Company to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans which the investors believe do not comply with applicable representations. An increase in requests for loss indemnification can negatively impact mortgage banking revenue as additional recourse expense.  The liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification claims for residential mortgage loans previously sold to investors was approximately $188,000 at December 31, 2024 and $152,000 at December 31, 2023.   
Community Banking
Through our community banking franchise, we provide banking and financial services primarily to individuals, small to mid-sized businesses, local governmental units and institutional clients residing primarily in the local areas we service. Profitability of this franchise is primarily driven by our net interest income and margin, our funding mix and related costs, the measurement of the allowance for credit losses and the impact of current and forecasted macroeconomic conditions on such measurement, the level of non-performing loans and other real estate owned, the amount of mortgage banking revenue and our history of acquiring banking operations and establishing 
de novo
 banking locations.  
Net interest income and margin
. The primary source of our revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on liabilities to fund those assets, including deposits and other borrowings. Net interest income can change significantly from period to period based on general levels of interest rates, customer prepayment patterns, the mix of interest-earning assets and the mix of interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits and borrowings.
Funding mix and related costs.
 The most significant source of funding in community banking is core deposits, which are comprised of non-interest-bearing deposits, non-brokered interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and domestic time deposits. Our branch network is the principal source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Community banking profitability has been favorably impacted in recent years as the Company funded strong loan growth with a more desirable blend of funds. 
Measurement of the allowance for credit losses.  
The Company adopted CECL as of January 1, 2020, which requires the estimate of expected credit losses over the entire life of financial assets measured at amortized cost. To measure lifetime expected credit losses, the Company adjusts credit loss estimates for reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic conditions. Such forecasts can significantly impact the profitability of our community banks as changing estimates of lifetime losses from period to period can result in significant fluctuations in provision for credit losses during those periods. In 2024, such fluctuations in provision for credit losses favorably impacted the profitability of our community banks, primarily as a result of improvement in key variables (Baa credit spread and Commercial Real Estate Price Index) within forecasted macroeconomic conditions.
54
Level of non-performing loans and other real estate owned
. The level of non-performing loans and other real estate owned can significantly impact our profitability as these loans and other real estate owned do not accrue any income, can be subject to charge-offs and write-downs due to deteriorating market conditions and generally result in additional legal and collections expenses.  The Company’s credit quality measures have remained at historically low levels in recent years. 
Mortgage banking revenue
. Our community banking franchise is also influenced by the level of fees generated by the origination of residential mortgages and the sale of such mortgages into the secondary market by Wintrust Mortgage. The Company recognized an increase of $10.1 million in mortgage banking revenue in 2024 compared to 2023 as a result of higher origination volumes and favorable fair value adjustments of MSRs in 2024 compared to 2023. Mortgage originations for sale totaled $2.6 billion and $2.0 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was driven by growth in both purchase and refinance originations as housing inventories have improved and interest rates pulled back from peak levels reached in 2023.  Partially offsetting the impact of higher originations and production margins was the change in fair value on EBOs guaranteed by U.S. government agencies.
Expansion of banking operations.
 Our historical financial performance has been affected by costs associated with growing market share in deposits and loans, establishing and acquiring banks, opening new branch facilities and building an experienced management team. Our financial performance generally reflects the improved profitability of our banking subsidiaries as they mature, offset by the costs of establishing and acquiring banks and opening new branch facilities. 
In determining the timing of the opening of additional branches of existing banks, and the acquisition of additional banks, we consider many factors, particularly our perceived ability to obtain an adequate return on our invested capital driven largely by the then existing cost of funds and lending margins, the general economic climate and the level of competition in a given market. 
In addition to the factors considered above, before we engage in expansion through 
de novo
 branches, we must first make a determination that the expansion fulfills our objective of enhancing shareholder value through potential future earnings growth and enhancement of the overall franchise value of the Company. Generally, we believe that, in normal market conditions, expansion through 
de novo
 growth is a better long-term investment than acquiring banks because the cost to bring a de novo location to profitability is generally substantially less than the premium paid for the acquisition of a healthy bank. Each opportunity to expand is unique from a cost and benefit perspective. Both FDIC-assisted and non-FDIC-assisted acquisitions offer a unique opportunity for the Company to expand into new and existing markets in a non-traditional manner. Potential acquisitions are reviewed in a similar manner as a 
de novo
 branch opportunities, however, FDIC-assisted and non-FDIC-assisted acquisitions have the ability to immediately enhance shareholder value. Factors including the valuation of our stock, other economic market conditions, the size and scope of the particular expansion opportunity and competitive landscape all influence the decision to expand via 
de novo
 growth or through acquisition. See discussion of acquisition activity in the “Recent Transactions” section below.
Specialty Finance
Through our specialty finance segment, we offer financing of insurance premiums for businesses and individuals; lease financing and other direct leasing opportunities; accounts receivable financing, value-added, out-sourced administrative services; and other specialty finance businesses. 
Financing of Commercial Insurance Premiums
The primary driver of profitability related to the financing of property and casualty insurance premiums is the net interest spread that FIRST Insurance Funding and FIFC Canada can produce between the yields on the loans generated and the cost of funds incurred by the business unit. The property and casualty insurance premium finance business is a competitive industry and yields on loans are influenced by the market rates offered by our competitors. The majority of loans originated by FIRST Insurance Funding are purchased by the banks in order to more fully utilize their lending capacity as these loans generally provide the banks with higher yields than alternative investments. We fund these loans primarily through our deposits, the cost of which is influenced by competitors in the retail banking markets in our market area.
Financing of Life Insurance Premiums
The primary driver of profitability related to the financing of life insurance premiums is the net interest spread that Wintrust Life Finance can produce between the yields on the loans generated and the cost of funds allocated to the business unit. Profitability of financing both commercial and life insurance premiums is also meaningfully impacted by leveraging 
55
information technology systems, maintaining operational efficiency and increasing average loan size, each of which allows us to expand our loan volume without significant capital investment.     
Wealth Management
Through our wealth management segment, we offer a full range of wealth management services through four separate subsidiaries (WPT, Wintrust Investments, GLA and CDEC): trust and investment services, tax-deferred like-kind exchange services, asset management solutions, and securities brokerage services. 
The primary drivers of profitability of the wealth management business can be associated with the level of commission received related to the trading performed by the brokerage customers for their accounts and the amount of assets under management in which the unit receives a management fee for advisory, administrative and custodial services. As such, revenues are influenced by a rise or fall in the debt and equity markets and the resulting increase or decrease in the value of our client accounts on which our fees are based. The commissions received by the brokerage unit are not as directly influenced by the directionality of the debt and equity markets but rather the desire of our customers to engage in trading based on their particular situations and outlooks of the market or particular stocks and bonds.
Financial Regulatory Reform
Our business is heavily regulated and supervised by federal agencies, state agencies and the federal & provincial governments of Canada.  Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which our business is subject have increased in recent years, initially in response to the financial crisis, and more recently in light of other factors such as the regional banking uncertainty in early 2023, technological updates, and market changes. Many of these changes have occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) and its implementing regulations, most of which are now in place. We expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision. 
The exact impact of the changing regulatory environment on our business and operations depends upon legislative or regulatory changes to reform the financial regulatory framework and the actions of our competitors, customers, and other market participants.  Legislative and regulatory changes could have a significant impact on us by, for example, requiring us to change our business practices; requiring us to meet more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements; limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities; imposing additional costs and compliance obligations on us; limiting fees we can charge for services; impacting the value of our assets; or otherwise adversely affecting our businesses and our earnings’ capabilities. We have already experienced significant increases in compliance related costs in recent years, and we are now subject to more stringent risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements than we were prior to the adoption of the U.S. Basel III Rules. We are also now subject to many mortgage-related rules promulgated by the CFPB that materially restructured the origination, services and securitization of residential mortgages in the United States. As discussed under Supervision and Regulation in Item 1, the FDIC adopted a final rule, applicable to all insured depository institutions, to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by 2 basis points, which began in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. There was no change to the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate in 2024. Additionally, there was a special assessment by the FDIC that was levied on banks with an asset size above $5 billion to recoup losses from certain bank failures that occurred early in 2023. Special assessment payments began in June of 2024. We will continue to monitor the impact that the implementation of applicable rules, regulations and policies arising out of any legislative or regulatory changes may have on our organization. For further discussion of the laws and regulations applicable to us and our subsidiary banks, please refer to “Business-Supervision and Regulation.”

Recent Transactions 
Business Combination
On August 1, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of Macatawa, the parent company of Macatawa Bank. In conjunction with the completed acquisition, the Company issued approximately 4.7 million shares of common stock. Macatawa operates 26 full-service branches located throughout communities in Kent, Ottawa and northern Allegan counties in the state of Michigan. Macatawa offers a full range of banking, retail and commercial lending, wealth management and ecommerce services to individuals, businesses and governmental entities. As of August 1, 2024, Macatawa had carrying values of approximately $2.7 billion in assets, $2.3 billion in deposits and $1.4 billion in loans. As of December 31, 2024, the Company recorded preliminary goodwill of approximately $142.1 million on the purchase. The initial purchase accounting for the acquisition, in accordance with GAAP, for this business combination is not finalized and is therefore subject to change. See Note (7) “Business Combinations” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of recent and other transactions.
Division Sale
In the first quarter of 2024, the Company sold its Retirement Benefits Advisors (“RBA”) division and recorded a gain of approximately $20.0 million in other non-interest income from the sale.
Business Combination
On April 3, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of Rothschild & Co Asset Management US Inc. and Rothschild & Co Risk Based Investments LLC from Rothschild & Co North America Inc. As of the acquisition date, the Company acquired approximately $12.6 million in net assets. As the transaction was determined to be a business combination, the Company recorded goodwill of approximately $2.6 million on the purchase.
SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP in the United States, prevailing practices of the banking industry, and the application of accounting policies of which are described in Note (1) “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have material impact on the Company’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2024, management views critical accounting estimates to include the determination of the allowance for credit losses, estimations of fair value, the valuations required for impairment testing of goodwill, the valuation and accounting for derivative instruments and income taxes as the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. These estimates were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully below.
Allowance for Credit Losses, including the Allowance for Loan Losses, Allowance for Losses on Lending-Related Commitments and Allowance for Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities 
The allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the life of a financial asset carried at amortized cost. Determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the fair value of the underlying collateral and amount and timing of expected future cash flows on individually assessed financial assets, estimated credit losses on pools of loans with similar risk characteristics, and consideration of reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic conditions, all of which are susceptible to significant change. At December 31, 2024, the loan and held-to-maturity debt securities portfolios represent 80% of total assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The Company also maintains an allowance for lending-related commitments, specifically unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit, which relates to certain amounts the Company is committed to lend (not unconditionally cancelable) but for which funds have not yet been disbursed. 
Key macroeconomic variable data points that are significant inputs into our credit loss models for the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios are the Baa corporate credit spread, as well as the Commercial Real Estate Pricing Index (“CREPI”) specifically related to the commercial real estate portfolio. Holding all other inputs constant, the table below shows the impact of changes in these key macroeconomic variable data points on the estimate of allowance for credit losses.

See Note (5) “Allowance for Credit Losses” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and the section titled “Loan Portfolio and Asset Quality” in Item 7 for a description of the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses.
Estimations of Fair Value
A portion of the Company’s assets and liabilities are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Condition, with changes in fair value recorded either through earnings or other comprehensive income in accordance with applicable accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These include the Company’s trading account securities, available-for-sale debt securities, equity securities with a readily determinable fair value, derivatives, mortgage loans held-for-sale, certain loans held-for-investment and mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”). The determination of fair value is important for certain other assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, loans individually assessed when measuring a related allowance for credit loss, and other real estate owned that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates.
Fair value is generally defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing, unrelated parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. Fair value is based on quoted market prices in an active market, or if market prices are not available, is estimated using models employing techniques such as matrix pricing or discounting expected cash flows. The significant assumptions used in the models, which include assumptions for interest rates, discount rates, prepayments and credit losses, are independently verified against observable market data where possible. Where observable market data is not available, the estimate of fair value becomes more subjective and involves a high degree of judgment. In this circumstance, fair value is estimated based on management’s judgment regarding the value that market participants would assign to the asset or liability. This valuation process takes into consideration factors such as market illiquidity. Imprecision in estimating these factors can impact the amount recorded on the balance sheet for a particular asset or liability with related impacts to earnings or other comprehensive income. See Note (22) “Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of fair value measurements.
Impairment Testing of Goodwill
The Company performs impairment testing of goodwill for each of its reporting units on an annual basis or more frequently when events warrant, using a qualitative or quantitative approach. Using a qualitative approach, the Company reviews any 
58
recent events or circumstances that would indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. These events and circumstances include the performance of the Company, the condition of the related industry in which the reporting unit operates and general economic environment and other factors. If the Company determines it is not more likely than not that there is impairment based on an evaluation of these events and circumstances, the Company may forgo the quantitative approach.
Using a quantitative approach, the Company compares each reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit was determined to have been higher than its fair value, the Company would measure and recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. Any impairment loss would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Valuations are estimated in good faith by management through the use of publicly available valuations of comparable entities and discounted cash flow models using internal financial projections in the reporting unit’s business plan.
Under both a qualitative and quantitative approach, the goodwill impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Events and factors that may significantly affect the analysis include: a significant decline in the Company’s expected future cash flows, a substantial increase in the discount rate, a sustained, significant decline in the Company’s stock price and market capitalization, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate. Other factors might include changing competitive forces, customer behaviors and attrition, revenue trends, cost structures, along with specific industry and market conditions. Adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of intangible assets and could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had three reporting units: Community Banking, Specialty Finance and Wealth Management. Based on the Company’s 2024 annual goodwill impairment testing, which was performed quantitatively, the Company concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit more likely than not exceeded the carrying amounts of the respective reporting units.
Derivative Instruments
The Company utilizes derivative instruments to manage risks such as interest rate risk or market risk. The Company’s policy prohibits using derivatives for speculative purposes.
Accounting for derivatives differs significantly depending on whether a derivative is designated as an accounting hedge, which is a transaction intended to reduce a risk associated with specific assets or liabilities or future expected cash flows at the time it is purchased. In order to qualify as an accounting hedge, a derivative must be designated as such at inception by management and meet certain criteria. Management must also continue to evaluate whether the instrument effectively reduces the risk associated with the hedged item. To determine if a derivative instrument continues to be an effective hedge, the Company must make assumptions and judgments about the continued effectiveness of the hedging strategies and the nature and timing of forecasted transactions. If the Company’s hedging strategy were to become ineffective, hedge accounting would no longer apply and the reported results of operations or financial condition could be materially affected. See Note (21) “Derivative Financial Instruments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of derivative accounting.
Income Taxes
The Company is subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states, Canada and other jurisdictions where it conducts business. These laws are complex and subject to potentially different interpretations by the taxpayer and the various taxing authorities. In determining the provision for income taxes, management must make judgments and estimates about the application of these inherently complex laws, related regulations and case law. In the process of preparing the Company’s tax returns, management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws. These interpretations are subject to challenge by the tax authorities upon audit or to reinterpretation based on management’s ongoing assessment of facts and evolving case law. Management reviews its uncertain tax positions and recognition of the benefits of such positions on a regular basis.
On a quarterly basis, management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current best estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reassessed on a quarterly basis, if business events or circumstances warrant. Additionally, any enactment of new tax rates requires the Company to re-measure its existing deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the new tax rate, with such adjustments recognized in current year earnings. See Note (17) “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of income taxes.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion of Wintrust’s results of operations requires an understanding that a majority of the Company’s bank subsidiaries have been started as de novo banks since December 1991. Wintrust has a strategy of continuing to build its customer base and securing broad product penetration in each marketplace that it serves. The Company has expanded its banking franchise from three banks with five offices in 1994 to 16 banks with 205 offices at the end of 2024. FIRST Insurance Funding and Wintrust Life Finance have matured into separate divisions that generated, on a national basis, $18.1 billion in total premium finance receivables in 2024 within the United States. FIFC Canada, acquired in 2012, originated $1.9 billion in Canadian property and casualty premium finance receivables in 2024. The Company’s leasing business increased its portfolio of assets, including direct financing leases, loans and equipment on operating leases, to $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2024. In addition, the wealth management companies have been building a team of experienced professionals who are located within a majority of the banks. 
Earnings Summary
Net income for the year ended December 31, 2024, totaled $695.0 million, or $10.31 per diluted common share, compared to $622.6 million, or $9.58 per diluted common share, in 2023, and $509.7 million, or $8.02 per diluted common share, in 2022. During 2024, net income increased by $72.4 million and earnings per diluted common share increased by $0.73. Net interest income increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of growth in average earning assets in 2024. Non-interest income increased primarily due to a $20.0 million gain recognized in the first quarter of 2024 related to the sale of the Company’s RBA division within its wealth management business and an increase in mortgage banking revenue in 2024 as compared 2023 primarily as a result of favorable fair value adjustments of MSRs, net of servicing hedge, and an increase in loans originated for sale, partially offset by unfavorable adjustments to the Company’s held-for-sale portfolio of EBOs guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, which are held at fair value.
Other items impacting net income in 2024 compared to 2023 include increased salary and employee benefits expenses.
Net Interest Income
The primary source of the Company’s revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and interest expense on the liabilities to fund those assets, including interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings. The amount of net interest income is affected by both changes in the level of interest rates, and the amount and composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 
Net interest income in 2024 totaled $1.96 billion, up from $1.84 billion in 2023 and up from $1.50 billion in 2022, representing an increase of $124.7 million, or 7%, in 2024 and an increase of $342.5 million, or 23%, in 2023. The table presented later in this section, titled “Changes in Interest Income and Expense,” presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and expense, by major category, attributable to changes in the volume of the balance sheet category and changes in the rate earned or paid with respect to that category of assets or liabilities for 2024 and 2023. 

Average earning assets increased $5.7 billion, or 11%, in 2024 and $2.8 billion, or 6%, in 2023. Loans are the most significant component of the earning asset base as they earn interest at a higher rate than the majority of other earning assets. Average loans increased $4.4 billion, or 11%, in 2024 and $3.6 billion, or 10%, in 2023. Total average loans as a percentage of total average earning assets were 80%, 80% and 77% in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The average yield on loans was 6.82% in 2024, 6.32% in 2023 and 4.12% in 2022, reflecting an increase of 50 basis points in 2024 and an increase of 220 basis points in 2023. The higher loan yields in 2024 compared to 2023 is primarily a result of new loan originations at higher market rates along with existing loans repricing at higher levels in 2024 compared to 2023. The average yield on liquidity management assets was 3.85% in 2024, 3.53% in 2023 and 2.15% in 2022, reflecting an increase of 32 basis points in 2024 and an increase of 138 basis points in 2023. The higher yield in 2024 compared to 2023 is a result of investment security purchases at higher market rates. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits, the largest component of the Company’s interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.58% in 2024, 2.81% in 2023 and 0.62% in 2022, representing an increase of 77 basis points in 2024 and an increase of 219 basis points in 2023. The higher level of interest-bearing deposits rates in 2024 compared to 2023 is primarily a result of increased deposit competition driving interest rates higher in 2024 compared to 2023. As a result of the above, net interest margin decreased to 3.51% (3.53% on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) in 2024 compared to 3.66% (3.68% on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, non-GAAP) in 2023.
Net interest income and net interest margin were also affected by amortization of valuation adjustments to earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of acquired businesses. Assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are required to be recognized at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. These valuation adjustments represent the difference between the estimated 
60
fair value and the carrying value of assets and liabilities acquired. These adjustments are amortized into interest income and interest expense based upon the estimated remaining lives of the assets and liabilities acquired.
Average Balance Sheets, Interest Income and Expense, and Interest Rate Yields and Costs
The following table sets forth the average balances, the interest earned or paid thereon, and the effective interest rate, yield or cost for each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The yields and costs include loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs that are considered adjustments to yields. Interest income on non-accruing loans is reflected in the year that it is collected, to the extent it is not applied to principal. Such amounts are not material to net interest income or the net change in net interest income in any year. Non-accrual loans are included in the average balances. Net interest income and the related net interest margin have been adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income, such as interest on municipal securities and loans, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis (non-GAAP). This table should be referred to in conjunction with discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.

Includes interest-bearing deposits from banks and securities purchased under resale agreements with original maturities of greater than three months. Cash equivalents include federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements with original maturities of three months or less.
The changes in net interest income are created by changes in both interest rates and volumes. In the table above, volume variances are computed using the change in volume multiplied by the previous year’s rate. Rate variances are computed using the change in rate multiplied by the previous year’s volume. The change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated between factors in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.  The change in interest due to an additional day resulting from the 2024 leap year has been allocated entirely to the change due to volume.

NM—Not Meaningful
Notable contributions to the change in non-interest income are as follows:
Mortgage banking revenue increased in 2024 as compared 2023 primarily as a result of a favorable fair value adjustments of MSRs, net of servicing hedge, and a increase in loans originated for sale, partially offset by payoffs, paydowns and repurchases of the existing portfolio. Mortgage banking revenue includes revenue from activities related to originating, selling and servicing residential real estate loans for the secondary market. 
A
 main factor in the mortgage banking revenue recognized by the Company is the volume of mortgage loans originated or purchased for sale. Mortgage loans originated for sale totaled $2.6 billion for the year ended 2024 compared to $2.0 billion for the same period of 2023. The increase in originations was primarily driven by growth in both purchase and refinance originations as housing inventories have improved and interest rates pulled back from peak levels reached in 2023. The percentage of origination volume from refinancing activities was 25% in 2024 as compared to 17% in 2023. 
The Company records MSRs at fair value on a recurring basis. During 2024, the fair value of the MSRs portfolio increased due to a favorable fair value adjustment of $4.4 million and retained servicing rights which led to capitalization of $30.0 million, partially offset by reduction in value of $23.0 million due to payoffs and paydowns of the existing portfolio. See Note (6) “Mortgage Servicing Rights (“MSRs”)” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a summary of the changes in the carrying value of MSRs.
Mortgage banking revenue is also impacted by changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held to economically hedge a portion of the fair value adjustments related to the Company’s MSRs portfolio. The change in fair value of the derivative contracts held as an economic hedge during 2024 was a $7.9 million unfavorable valuation adjustment compared to a $1.3 
64
million favorable valuation adjustment in 2023. The table below presents additional selected information regarding mortgage banking for the respective periods.

Wealth management revenue increased by $15.6 million in 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to increased asset management fees as a result of higher assets under management when compared to the same period in the prior year. Trust and asset management fees are based primarily on the market value of the assets under management or administration as well as volume of tax-deferred like-kind exchange services provided during a period. 
Service charges on deposit accounts increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of higher fees associated with commercial account analysis fees.
Net losses on investment securities in 2024 were primarily the result of unrealized losses on equity investments. The Company did not recognize any credit-related write-downs or other-than-temporary impairment charges within its available-for-sale or held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio in 2024 or 2023, respectively.
Fees from covered call option transactions totaled $10.2 million in 2024, compared to $21.9 million in 2023. The Company has typically written call options with terms of less than three months against certain U.S. Treasury and agency securities held in its portfolio for liquidity and other purposes. Management has effectively entered into these transactions with the goal of economically hedging security positions and enhancing its overall return on its investment portfolio. These option transactions are designed to increase the total return associated with holding certain investment securities and do not qualify as hedges pursuant to accounting guidance. There were no outstanding call option contracts at December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
Miscellaneous non-interest income includes loan servicing fees, income from other investments, service charges and other fees. The increased miscellaneous other income for 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to a $20.0 million gain recognized in the first quarter of 2024 related to the sale of the Company’s RBA division within its wealth management business as well as a $4.6 million gain recognized in the second quarter of 2024 on the sale of premium finance receivables.

NM—Not Meaningful
Notable contributions to the change in non-interest expense are as follows:
Salaries and employee benefits is the largest component of non-interest expense, accounting for 58% of the total in 2024 compared to 57% in 2023. Salaries and employee benefits increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of elevated commissions from increased mortgage production as well as due to the increase in employees related to the growth of the Company, including Macatawa. 
Software and equipment expense increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of increased software licensing expenses as the Company invests in enhancements to the digital customer experience, upgrades to infrastructure and enhancements to information security capabilities. Software and equipment expense includes furniture, equipment and computer software, depreciation and repairs and maintenance costs.
Amortization of other-acquisition related intangible assets increased in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to the amortization of the core deposit intangible associated with the Macatawa acquisition.
Professional fees expense increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of increased fees on consulting services and legal costs associated with the Macatawa acquisition. Professional fees  include  legal,  audit,  and  tax  fees,  external  loan  review  costs,  consulting  arrangements  and  normal  regulatory  exam assessments.
FDIC insurance expense decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to the Company’s recognition of approximately $34.4 million in 2023 as compared to $5.2 million recognized in 2024 accrued for the estimated amount owed as a result of the FDIC special assessment on uninsured deposits in response to certain bank failures occurring in 2023. 
67
Miscellaneous non-interest expense includes ATM expenses, correspondent banking charges, directors’ fees, telephone, postage, corporate insurance, dues and subscriptions, problem loan expenses and other miscellaneous operational losses and costs. Miscellaneous non-interest expense increased in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily as a result of various other operational costs including an increase in interest payments made on collateral received for outstanding interest rate derivative contracts and includes approximately $4.3 million in acquisition related expenses related to the acquisition of Macatawa.
Income Taxes
The Company recorded income tax expense of $252.0 million in 2024 compared to $222.5 million in 2023 and $190.9 million 2022. The effective tax rates were 26.6% in 2024, 26.3% in 2023 and 27.2% in 2022. The effective tax rate in 2024 is slightly   higher due to the Company’s income tax expense being impacted by an increase in non-deductible items in the most recent comparable period. Income tax expense was also impacted by the tax effects related to the issuance of shares in share-based compensation plans. These tax effects fluctuate based on the Company’s stock price and timing of employee stock option exercises and vesting of other share based awards. The Company recorded a net excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation of $4.5 million in 2024, a net excess tax benefit of $2.9 million 2023, and a net excess tax benefit of $2.9 million in 2022, the majority of which were recognized in the first quarter in each year. Please refer to Note (17) “Income Taxes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion and analysis of the Company’s tax position, including a reconciliation of the tax expense computed at the statutory tax rate to the Company’s actual tax expense.
Operating Segment Results 
As described in Note (24) “Segment Information” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, the Company’s operations consist of three primary segments: community banking, specialty finance and wealth management. The Company’s profitability is primarily dependent on the net interest income, provision for credit losses, non-interest income and operating expenses of its community banking segment. For purposes of internal segment profitability, management allocates certain intersegment and parent company balances. Management allocates a portion of revenues to the specialty finance segment related to loans and leases originated by the specialty finance segment and sold or assigned to the community banking segment. Similarly, for purposes of analyzing the contribution from the wealth management segment, management allocates a portion of the net interest income earned by the community banking segment on deposit balances of customers of the wealth management segment to the wealth management segment. Finally, expenses incurred at the Wintrust parent company are allocated to each segment based on each segment’s risk-weighted assets.  
The community banking segment’s net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $1.5 billion as compared to $1.4 billion for the same period in 2023, an increase of $95.3 million, or 7%. The increase in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily attributable to increased interest and fees on loans due to loan growth and increased interest rates, partially offset by increased interest expense on deposit
s
. The community banking segment recorded a provision for credit losses of $88.3 million in 2024 compared to $104.9 million in 2023. The provision for credit losses decreased in 2024 compared to 2023
 primarily due to improvements in the macroeconomic forecast partially offset by increased loan growth across portfolios including $15.5 million in Day 1 loan loss provision related to the acquisition of Macatawa
. Non-interest income for the community banking segment increased $16.8 million, or 6% in 2024 when compared to 2023. The increase in non-interest income in 2024 compared to 2023 was 
primarily the result of increased mortgage banking revenue due to 
favorable fair value adjustments of MSRs, net of servicing hedge,
 and higher originations for s
ale.  Non-interest expenses increased by $65.5 million in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily because of higher salary, commissions, and incentive compensation. The community banking segment’s net income for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $458.7 million, an increase of $44.7 million, compared to net income of $414.1 million in 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net interest income and a decrease in the provision for credit losses in 2024, as discussed above.
The specialty finance segment’s net interest income totaled $356.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $329.0 million in the same period of 2023, an increase of $27.2 million, or 8%. The increase in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily attributable to loan growth and increased interest rates on the premium finance receivables portfolios. The specialty finance segment’s provision for credit losses totaled $12.7 million in 2024 compared to $9.5 million in 2023.  The increase was due to 
higher net charge-offs experienced in 2024 and loan growth
. The specialty finance segment’s non-interest income increased to $119.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $106.0 million in 2023.  Non-interest expenses increased by $20.9 million in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily because of higher salary, commissions, and incentive compensation as well as other segment expenses.  For 2024, our commercial premium finance operations, life insurance premium finance operations, leasing operations and accounts receivable finance operations accounted for 49%, 30%, 19% and 2%, respectively, of the total revenues of our specialty finance business. Net income of the specialty finance segment totaled $186.3 million and $175.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
The wealth management segment reported net interest income of $30.0 million for 2024 and $32.7 million for 2023. Net interest income for this segment is primarily comprised of an allocation of net interest income earned by the community banking segment on non-interest bearing and interest-bearing wealth management customer account balances on deposit at the 
68
banks. Wealth management customer account balances on deposit at the banks averaged $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively. This segment recorded non-interest income of $168.1 million for 2024 as compared to $136.6 million for 2023. The increase was primarily due to a $20.0 million gain recognized in the first quarter of 2024 related to the sale of the Company’s RBA division within its wealth management business.  Non-interest expenses increased by $6.4 million in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily because of higher commissions and incentive compensation.  Distribution of wealth management services through each bank continues to be a focus of the Company as the number of brokers in its banks continues to increase. The Company is committed to growing the wealth management segment in order to better service its customers and create a more diversified revenue stream. The wealth management segment reported net income of $50.0 million for 2024 compared to $33.0 million for 2023.
Analysis of Financial Condition
Total assets were $64.9 billion at December 31, 2024, representing an increase of $8.6 billion, or 15%, when compared to December 31, 2023.

Total average earning assets increased $5.7 billion, or 11%, in 2024. Average earning assets comprised 94% of average total assets in 2024 and  2023.
Mortgage loans held-for-sale. 
Average mortgage loans held-for-sale totaled $348.3 million in 2024, compared to $294.4 million in 2023. These balances represent mortgage loans awaiting subsequent sale in the secondary market with such sales eliminating the interest-rate risk associated with these loans, as they are predominantly long-term fixed rate loans, and provides a source of non-interest revenue. The increase in average balance from 2023 to 2024 was primarily due to higher mortgage origination production balances.
69
Loans, net of unearned income.
 Average total loans, net of unearned income, totaled $44.8 billion and increased $4.4 billion, or 11%, in 2024. Average commercial loans totaled $14.1 billion in 2024, and increased $1.6 billion, or 13%, over the average balance in 2023. Average commercial real estate loans totaled $12.2 billion in 2024, increasing $1.5 billion, or 15%, since 2023. Combined, these categories comprised 59% and 57% of the average loan portfolio in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The growth realized in these categories for 2024 is primarily attributable to increased business development efforts during the period.
Home equity loans averaged $384.1 million in 2024, and increased $46.3 million, or 14%, when compared to the average balance in 2023. Unused commitments on home equity lines of credit totaled $999.1 million

at December 31, 2024 and $845.6 million at December 31, 2023. The Company has been actively managing its home equity portfolio to ensure that diligent pricing, appraisal and other underwriting activities continue to exist. 
Residential real estate loans averaged $3.0 billion in 2024, and increased $547.3 million, or 22%, from the average balance in 2023. The increase in average balance was partially due to the Company originating, through Wintrust Mortgage, more loans  which were retained in the banks’ portfolios rather than being sold into the secondary market. 
Average premium finance receivables totaled $15.0 billion in 2024, and accounted for 33% of the Company’s average total loans. In 2024, average premium finance receivables increased $0.7 billion, or 5%, compared to 2023. The increase during 2024 was the result of effective marketing and customer servicing as well as continued originations within the portfolio due to hardening insurance market conditions driving a higher average size of new property and casualty insurance premium finance receivables. Approximately $20.0 billion of premium finance receivables were originated in 2024 compared to approximately $17.9 billion in 2023. 
Other loans represent a wide variety of personal and consumer loans to individuals. Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than mortgage loans but generally involve more credit risk due to the type and nature of the collateral.
Liquidity Management Assets.
 Funds that are not utilized for loan originations are used to purchase investment securities and short-term money market investments, to sell as federal funds and to maintain in interest-bearing deposits with banks. Average liquidity management assets accounted for 19% and 19% of total average earning assets in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Average liquidity management assets increased $1.2 billion in 2024 compared to 2023. The balances of these assets can fluctuate based on management’s ongoing effort to manage liquidity and for asset liability management purposes. The Company will continue to prudently evaluate and utilize liquidity sources as needed, including the management of availability with the FHLB and FRB and utilization of the revolving credit facility with unaffiliated banks.
Other earning assets.
 Other earning assets include brokerage customer receivables and trading account securities. In the normal course of business, Wintrust Investments activities involve the execution, settlement, and financing of various securities transactions. Wintrust Investments customer securities activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis. In margin transactions, Wintrust Investments, under an agreement with the out-sourced securities firm, extends credit to its customer, subject to various regulatory and internal margin requirements, collateralized by cash and securities in customer’s accounts. In connection with these activities, Wintrust Investments executes and the out-sourced firm clears customer transactions relating to the sale of securities not yet purchased, substantially all of which are transacted on a margin basis subject to individual exchange regulations. Such transactions may expose Wintrust Investments to off-balance-sheet risk, particularly in volatile trading markets, in the event margin requirements are not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur. In the event a customer fails to satisfy its obligations, Wintrust Investments under an agreement with the out-sourced securities firm, may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at prevailing market prices to fulfill the customer's obligations. Wintrust Investments seeks to control the risks associated with its customers’ activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with various regulatory and internal guidelines. Wintrust Investments monitors required margin levels daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral or to reduce positions when necessary.

We make commercial loans for many purposes, including working capital lines, which are generally renewable annually and supported by business assets, personal guarantees and additional collateral. Such loans may vary in size based on customer need. Commercial business lending is generally considered to involve a slightly higher degree of risk than traditional consumer bank lending. Primarily as a result of growth in the portfolio, our allowance for credit losses in our commercial loan portfolio increased to $175.8 million as of December 31, 2024 compared to $169.6 million as of December 31, 2023. 
Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by a first mortgage lien and assignment of rents on the property. Since most of our bank branches are located in the Chicago metropolitan area, southern Wisconsin, and west Michigan, 68.5% of our commercial real estate loan portfolio is located in this region as of December 31, 2024. We have been able to effectively manage our total non-performing commercial real estate loans. As of December 31, 2024, our allowance for credit losses related to this portfolio was $222.9 million compared to $223.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses is primarily due to the impact on the Company’s loan loss modeling from improving macroeconomic conditions and expectations between the two reporting dates primarily related to the Baa credit spread and the Commercial Real Estate Price Index. The table below sets forth the commercial real estate loans by property type and owner vs. non-owner occupied.

The Company also participates in mortgage warehouse lending which is included above within commercial, industrial and other, by providing interim funding to unaffiliated mortgage bankers to finance residential mortgages originated by such bankers for sale into the secondary market. The Company’s loans to the mortgage bankers are secured by the business assets of the mortgage companies as well as the specific mortgage loans funded by the Company, after they have been pre-approved for purchase by third party end lenders. The Company may also provide interim financing for packages of mortgage loans on a bulk basis in circumstances where the mortgage bankers desire to competitively bid on a number of mortgages for sale as a package in the secondary market. 
Home equity loans.
 The Company’s home equity loans and lines of credit are primarily originated by each of the bank subsidiaries in their local markets where there is a strong understanding of the underlying real estate value. The Company’s banks monitor and manage these loans, and conduct an automated review of all home equity lines of credit at least twice per year. This review collects FICO and Bankruptcy scores for each home equity borrower and identifies situations where the credit strength of the borrower is declining. When other specific events occur that may influence repayment, information such as tax liens or judgments is collected. The bank subsidiaries use this information to manage loans that may be higher risk and to determine whether to obtain additional credit information or updated property valuations. In a limited number of cases, the Company may issue home equity credit together with first mortgage financing, and requests for such financing are evaluated on a combined basis.
The rates we offer on new home equity lending are based on several factors, including appraisals and valuation due diligence, in order to reflect inherent risk, and we place additional scrutiny on larger home equity requests. It is not our practice to advance more than 85% of the appraised value of the underlying asset, which ratio we refer to as the loan-to-value ratio, or LTV ratio, and a majority of the credit we previously extended, when issued, had an LTV ratio of less than 80%. Our home equity loan portfolio has performed well in light of the ongoing volatility in the overall residential real estate market. 
Residential real estate.
 The Company’s residential real estate portfolio includes one- to four-family adjustable rate mortgages, construction loans to individuals and bridge financing loans for qualifying customers as well as certain long-term fixed rate loans. As of December 31, 2024, our residential loan portfolio totaled $3.6 billion, or 8% of our total outstanding loans.
Our adjustable rate mortgages are often non-agency conforming. These loans generally provide for periodic and lifetime limits on the interest rate adjustments among other features. Additionally, adjustable rate mortgages may pose a higher risk of delinquency and default because they require borrowers to make larger payments when interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2024, excluding early buyout loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, $23.8 million of our residential real estate mortgages, or 0.7% of our residential real estate loan portfolio were classified as nonaccrual, no balances were 90 or more days past due and still accruing, $24.6 million were 30 to 89 days past due or 0.7% and $3.4 billion were current or 98.6%. We believe that since our loan portfolio consists primarily of locally originated loans, and since the majority of our borrowers are longer-term customers with lower LTV ratios, we face a relatively low risk of borrower default and delinquency.
75
Due to interest rate risk considerations, the Company generally sells in the secondary market loans originated with long-term fixed rates, for which we receive fee income. The Company also selectively retains certain of these loans within the banks’ own loan portfolios where they are non-agency conforming, or where the terms of the loans make them favorable to retain. A portion of the loans we sold into the secondary market were sold with the servicing of those loans retained. The amount of loans serviced for others as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $12.4 billion and $12.0 billion, respectively. All other mortgage loans sold into the secondary market were sold without the retention of servicing rights.
The GNMA optional repurchase programs allow financial institutions acting as servicers to buyout individual delinquent mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the institution was the original transferor of such loans. At the option of the servicer and without prior authorization from GNMA, the servicer may repurchase such delinquent loans for an amount equal to the remaining principal balance of the loan. Under FASB ASC 860, “Transfers and Servicing,” this early buyout option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met, at which time the option becomes unconditional. When the Company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans under the unconditional repurchase option and the expected benefit of the potential repurchase is more than trivial, the loans can no longer be reported as sold and must be brought back onto the balance sheet as loans at fair value, regardless of whether the Company intends to exercise the early buyout option. These rebooked loans are reported as loans held-for-investment, part of the residential real estate portfolio, with the offsetting liability being reported in accrued interest payable and other liabilities. When the early buyout option on these rebooked GNMA loans is exercised, the repurchased loans continue to be carried at fair value. Additionally, such loans typically transfer to mortgage loans held-for-sale at the time of early buyout as the Company’s intent is to cure and resell such loans subsequent to repurchase from GNMA. If such intent to cure and resell changes subsequent to early buyout, the Company reclassifies such loans as held-for-investment. Early buyout loan classified as held-for-investment totaled $156.8 million at December 31, 2024 compared to $150.6 million at December 31, 2023. Such loans consist of both the rebooked GNMA loans and the early buyout exercised loans classified as held-for-investment discussed above. Rebooked GNMA loans held-for-investment amounted to $115.0 million at December 31, 2024, compared to $92.8 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in balance from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 was the result of a slightly higher delinquency rate between periods and less frequent exercising of the early buyout option by the Company. As of December 31, 2024, early buyout exercised loans held-for-investment totaled $41.8 million compared to $57.8 million as of December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, early buyout exercised mortgage loans held-for-sale remained relatively stable and totaled $141.5 million and $137.2 million, respectively. 
It is not the Company’s current practice to underwrite, and there are no plans to underwrite subprime, Alt A, no or little documentation loans, or option ARM loans. As of December 31, 2024, none of our mortgage loans consist of interest-only loans.
Premium finance receivables — property & casualty.
 FIRST Insurance Funding and FIFC Canada originated approximately $18.4 billion in property and casualty insurance premium finance receivables during 2024 as compared to approximately $16.4 billion  in 2023. FIRST Insurance Funding and FIFC Canada makes loans to finance insurance premiums related to property and casualty insurance policies. The loans are indirectly originated by working through independent medium and large insurance agents and brokers located throughout the United States and Canada. The insurance premiums financed are primarily for commercial customers’ purchases of liability, property and casualty and other commercial insurance. This lending involves relatively rapid turnover of the loan portfolio and high volume of loan originations. The Company performs ongoing credit and other reviews of the agents and brokers, and performs various internal audit steps to mitigate against the risk of fraud. The majority of these loans are purchased by the banks in order to more fully utilize their lending capacity as these loans generally provide the banks with higher yields than alternative investments.
Premium finance receivables — life insurance.
 Wintrust Life Finance originated approximately $1.7 billion in life insurance premium finance receivables in 2024 as compared to $1.5 billion in 2023. The Company continues to experience a high level of competition and pricing pressure within the current market. These loans are originated directly with the borrowers with assistance from life insurance carriers, independent insurance agents, financial advisors and legal counsel. The life insurance policy is the primary form of collateral. In addition, these loans often are secured with a letter of credit, marketable securities or certificates of deposit. In some cases, Wintrust Life Finance may make a loan that has a partially unsecured position.
Consumer and other.
 Included in the consumer and other loan category is a wide variety of personal and consumer loans to individuals. The Company originates consumer loans in order to provide a wider range of financial services to its customers. Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than mortgage loans but generally involve more credit risk than mortgage loans due to the type and nature of the collateral. 
76
Foreign.
 The Company had approximately $824.4 million of loans to businesses with operations in foreign countries as of December 31, 2024 compared to $920.4 million at December 31, 2023. This balance as of December 31, 2024 consists of loans originated by FIFC Canada.
Loan Concentrations
Loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. The Company had limited concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans at December 31, 2024, including the specialty finance operating segment, which are diversified throughout the United States and Canada.

Past Due Loans and Non-Performing Assets
The Company’s ability to manage credit risk depends in large part on its ability to properly identify and manage problem loans. To do so, the Company operates a credit risk rating system under which credit management personnel assign a credit risk rating (1 to 10 rating, with higher scores indicating higher risk) to each loan at the time of origination and review loans on a regular basis. For loans measured at amortized cost, these credit risk ratings are also an important aspect of the Company’s allowance for credit losses measurement methodology. The credit risk rating structure and classifications are shown below:
1 Rating

—    

Minimal Risk (Loss Potential — none or extremely low) (Superior asset quality, excellent liquidity, minimal leverage)
2 Rating

—    

Modest Risk (Loss Potential demonstrably low) (Very good asset quality and liquidity, strong leverage capacity)
3 Rating

—    

Average Risk (Loss Potential low but no longer refutable) (Mostly satisfactory asset quality and liquidity, good leverage capacity)
4 Rating

—    

Above Average Risk (Loss Potential variable, but some potential for deterioration) (Acceptable asset quality, little excess liquidity, modest leverage capacity)
5 Rating

—    

Management Attention Risk (Loss Potential moderate if corrective action not taken) (Generally acceptable asset quality, somewhat strained liquidity, minimal leverage capacity, minimum for most commercial real estate construction loans)
6 Rating

—    

Special Mention (Loss Potential moderate if corrective action not taken) (Assets in this category are currently protected, potentially weak, but not to the point of substandard classification)
7 Rating

—    

Substandard Accrual (Loss Potential distinct possibility that the bank may sustain some loss, but no discernible impairment) (Must have well defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt)
8 Rating

—    

Substandard Non-accrual (Loss Potential well documented probability of loss, including potential impairment) (Must have well defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt)
9 Rating

—    

Doubtful (Loss Potential extremely high) (These assets have all the weaknesses in those classified “substandard” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current existing facts, conditions, and values, highly improbable)
10 Rating

—    

Loss (fully charged-off) (Loans in this category are considered fully uncollectible.)
Generally, each loan officer is responsible for monitoring his or her loan portfolio, recommending a credit risk rating for each loan in his or her portfolio and ensuring the credit risk ratings are appropriate. These credit risk ratings are then ratified by the bank’s chief credit officer and/or concurrence credit officer. Credit risk ratings are determined by evaluating a number of factors including: a borrower’s financial strength, cash flow coverage, collateral protection and guarantees. The Company maintains an internal loan review function to independently review a portion of the loan portfolio to evaluate the appropriateness of the management-assigned credit risk ratings. These ratings are subject to further review at each of our bank subsidiaries by the applicable regulatory authority, including the FRB of Chicago and the OCC, and are also reviewed by our internal loan review staff and our internal audit staff.
The Company’s Problem Loan Reporting system includes all such loans described above with credit risk ratings of 6 through 9. This system is designed to provide an on-going detailed tracking mechanism for each problem loan. Once management determines that a loan has deteriorated to a point where it has a credit risk rating of 6 or worse, the Company’s Managed Asset Division performs an overall credit and collateral review. As part of this review, all underlying collateral is identified and the valuation methodology is analyzed and tracked. As a result of this initial review by the Company’s Managed Asset Division, the credit risk rating is reviewed and a portion of the outstanding loan balance may be deemed uncollectible and, as a result, no longer share similar risk characteristics as its related pool. If that is the case, the individual loan is considered collateral dependent and individually assessed for an allowance for credit loss. The Company’s individual assessment utilizes an 
79
independent re-appraisal of the collateral (unless such a third-party evaluation is not possible due to the unique nature of the collateral, such as a closely-held business or thinly traded securities). In the case of commercial real estate collateral, an independent third party appraisal is ordered by the Company’s Real Estate Services Group to determine if there has been any change in the underlying collateral value. These independent appraisals are reviewed by the Real Estate Services Group and sometimes by independent third party valuation experts and may be adjusted depending upon market conditions.
Through the credit risk rating process, such loans are reviewed to determine if they are performing in accordance with the original contractual terms. If the borrower has failed to comply with the original contractual terms, further action may be required by the Company, including a downgrade in the credit risk rating, movement to non-accrual status or a charge-off. If the Company determines that a loan amount or portion thereof is uncollectible, the loan’s credit risk rating is immediately downgraded to an 8 or 9 and the uncollectible amount is charged-off. Any loan that has a partial charge-off continues to be assigned a credit risk rating of an 8 or 9 for the duration of time that a balance remains outstanding. The Company undertakes a thorough and ongoing analysis to determine if additional impairment and/or charge-offs are appropriate and to begin a workout plan for the credit to minimize actual losses. In determining the appropriate charge-off for collateral-dependent loans, the Company considers the results of appraisals for the associated collateral.
The Company’s approach to workout plans and restructuring loans is built on the credit-risk rating process. A modification of a loan with an existing credit risk rating of 6 or worse or a modification of any other credit, which will result in a restructured credit risk rating of 6 or worse must be reviewed for enhanced loan modifications that now must be disclosed in accordance with ASU 2022-02. In that event, our Managed Assets Division conducts an overall credit and collateral review. A modification of a loan is considered to be enhanced if both (1) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and (2) for economic or legal reasons, the bank grants a concession to a borrower that it would not otherwise consider. The modification of a loan where the credit risk rating is 5 or better both before and after such modification is not considered to be an enhanced modification. Based on the Company’s credit risk rating system, it considers that borrowers whose credit risk rating is 5 or better are not experiencing financial difficulties and therefore, are not considered enhanced modifications.
Loan modifications are assessed at the time of the modification and on a quarterly basis to measure an allowance for credit loss. The carrying amount of the loan is compared to the expected payments to be received, discounted at the loan’s original rate, or for collateral dependent loans, to the fair value of the collateral.  Any shortfall is recorded as a reserve.
For loans that do not meet the criteria listed above for enhanced modifications, if based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due to it according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement, a loan is individually assessed for measuring the allowance for credit losses and if necessary, a reserve is established. In determining the appropriate reserve for collateral-dependent loans, the Company considers the results of appraisals for the associated collateral.
Non-Performing Assets

(1)
The following table sets forth the Company’s non-performing assets, and for the years prior to 2023, the troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) performing under the contractual terms of the loan agreement as of the dates shown. Reporting periods prior to the adoption of ASU 2022-02 as of January 1, 2023 present information on loan modifications representing TDRs under the prior accounting standards and related disclosure requirements. Prior to January 1, 2020, Purchased Credit-Impaired (“PCI”) loans were aggregated into pools by common risk characteristics for accounting purposes, including recognition of interest income on a pool basis. As a result of the implementation of CECL, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, PCI loans transitioned to a classification of Purchased Credit Deteriorated (“PCD”) loans, which no longer maintains the prior pools and related accounting concepts. Recognition of interest income on PCD loans is considered at the individual asset level following the Company’s accrual policies, instead of based upon the entire pool of loans. Due to the adoption of CECL, the Company included  $22.6 million of PCD loans in total non-performing loans as of  December 31, 2020.

(3)
Non-accrual loans included TDRs totaling  $4.5 million, $11.8 million, and $21.2 million  as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
At this time, management believes reserves are appropriate to absorb losses that are expected upon the ultimate resolution of these credits. 
Management will continue to actively review and monitor its loan portfolios, in an effort to identify problem credits in a timely manner. 
Loan Portfolio Aging
As of December 31, 2024, $164.4 million, or 0.3% of all loans, excluding early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, were 60 to 89 days (or two payments) past due and $249.9 million, or 0.5%, were 30 to 59 days (or one payment) past 
81
due. As of December 31, 2023, $69.9 million, or 0.2%, of all loans, excluding early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies were 60 to 89 days (or two payments) past due and $227.6 million, or 0.5%, were 30 to 59 days (or one payment) past due. Many of the commercial and commercial real estate loans shown as 60 to 89 days and 30 to 59 days past due are included on the Company’s internal problem loan reporting system. Loans on this system are closely monitored by management on a monthly basis. 
The Company’s home equity and residential loan portfolios continue to exhibit low delinquency ratios. Home equity loans at December 31, 2024 that are current with regard to the contractual terms of the loan agreement represent 99.0% of the total home equity portfolio. Residential real estate loans, excluding early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, at December 31, 2024 that are current with regards to the contractual terms of the loan agreements comprise 98.6% of these residential real estate loans outstanding.
For more information regarding delinquent loans as of December 31, 2024, see Note (5) “Allowance for Credit Losses” in Item 8.

Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses, specifically the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded commitment losses, represents management’s estimate of lifetime expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses is determined quarterly using a methodology that incorporates important risk characteristics of each loan, as described below under “How We Determine the Allowance for Credit Losses” in this Item 7. 
82

Management determined that the allowance for credit losses was appropriate at December 31, 2024, and that the loan portfolio is well diversified and well secured, without undue concentration in any specific risk area. While this process involves a high degree of management judgment, the allowance for credit losses is based on a comprehensive, well documented, and consistently applied analysis of the Company’s loan portfolio. This analysis takes into consideration all available information existing as of the financial statement date, including environmental factors such as economic, industry, geographical and political factors, when considered applicable. The relative level of allowance for credit losses is reviewed and compared to industry peers. This review encompasses levels of total non-performing loans, portfolio mix, portfolio concentrations and overall levels of net charge-off. Historical trending of both the Company’s results and the industry peers is also reviewed to analyze comparative significance.

     NM—Not Meaningful
The allowance for credit losses, as related to loans and lending-related commitments, is comprised of an allowance for loan losses, which is determined with respect to loans that we have originated, and an allowance for unfunded commitment losses. A separate allowance for held-to-maturity securities losses is measured related to such debt securities portfolio. Our allowance for unfunded commitment losses is determined with respect to funds that we have committed to lend but for which funds have not yet been disbursed and is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for unfunded lending-related commitments totaled $72.6 million as of December 31, 2024 compared to $83.0 million as of December 31, 2023.
84
Additions to the allowance for credit losses are charged to earnings through the provision for credit losses. Charge-offs represent the amount of loans that have been determined to be uncollectible during a given period, and are deducted from the allowance for credit losses, and recoveries represent the amount of collections received from loans that had previously been charged off, and are credited to the allowance for credit losses. See Note (5) “Allowance for Credit Losses” of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 8 of this report for further discussion of activity within the allowance for credit losses during the period and the relationship with respective loan balances for each loan category and the total loan portfolio.
How We Determine the Allowance for Credit Losses
The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective or pooled basis by loans that share similar risk characteristics. If the loan no longer exhibits risk characteristics similar to that of a pool, typically due to credit deterioration of the related borrower, the Company analyzes the loan for purposes of individually assessing a specific allowance for credit loss as part of the Problem Loan Reporting system review. A separate reserve is collectively measured for loans continuing to share risk characteristics and, as a result, remaining in the pools. See Note (5) “Allowance for Credit Losses” of the Consolidated Financial Statements presented under Item 8 of this report for further discussion of the allowance for credit losses measurement process.
Collective Measurement
The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective or pooled basis when similar risk characteristics exist, based upon the segmentation discussed above. The Company utilizes modeling methodologies that estimate lifetime credit loss rates on each pool.  These methodologies include estimating the probability of default and loss given default on the commercial and commercial real estate segments, using the weighted-average remaining maturity methodology for the residential real estate, home equity, and consumer segments, and utilizing an assumption-based approach focusing on historical loss rates for the premium finance receivables segments. Historical credit loss history is adjusted for reasonable and supportable forecasts developed by the Company on a quantitative or qualitative basis and incorporates third party economic forecasts. Reasonable and supportable forecasts consider the macroeconomic factors that are most relevant to evaluating and predicting expected credit losses in the Company's financial assets. Currently, the Company utilizes an eight quarter forecast period using a single macroeconomic scenario provided by a third party and reviewed within the Company's governance structure. For periods beyond the ability to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts, the Company reverts to historical loss rates at an input level, straight-line over a four quarter reversion period. Expected credit losses are measured over the contractual term of the financial asset with consideration of expected prepayments. Expected extensions, renewals or modifications of the financial asset are considered when the expected extension, renewal or modification is contained within the existing agreement and is not unconditionally cancelable. The methodologies discussed above are applied to both current asset balances on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Condition and off-balance sheet commitments (i.e. unfunded lending-related commitments).
Individual Assessment
Loans with a credit risk rating of a 6 through 9 are reviewed on a monthly basis to determine if (a) an amount is deemed uncollectible (a charge-off) or (b) it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect amounts due in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. In cases in which collectability is not probable, the loan is considered to no longer exhibit shared risk characteristics of a pool and as a result, is individually assessed for allowance for credit losses measurement purposes. If a loan is individually assessed credit risk rating 8 or 9, the carrying amount of the loan is compared to the expected payments to be received, discounted at the loan’s original rate, or for foreclosure-probable and collateral dependent loans, to the fair value of the collateral less the estimated cost to sell, when appropriate under accounting rules. Any shortfall is recorded as a specific reserve within the allowance for credit losses.
Home Equity, Residential Real Estate and Consumer Loans
The determination of the appropriate allowance for credit losses for home equity, residential real estate and consumer loans differs from the process used for commercial and commercial real estate loans. These portfolios utilize the weighted-average remaining maturity (“WARM”) methodology. The WARM methodology is an assumption-based approach that utilizes historical loss and prepayment information as the basis to estimate prepayment and credit adjusted contractual cash flows. The Company considers a qualitative factor to adjust historical information for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The same credit risk rating system and Problem Loan Reporting systems are used. The only significant difference is in how the credit risk ratings are assigned to these loans.
The home equity loan portfolio is reviewed on a loan by loan basis by analyzing current FICO and Bankruptcy scores of the borrowers, line availability, recent line usage, approaching maturity, and the aging status of the loan. Certain of these factors, or combination of these factors, may cause a portion of the credit risk ratings of home equity loans across all banks to be 
85
downgraded. Similar to commercial and commercial real estate loans, once a home equity loan’s credit risk rating is downgraded to a 6 through 9, the Company’s Managed Asset Division reviews and advises the subsidiary banks as to collateral valuations and as to the ultimate resolution of the credits that deteriorate to a non-accrual status to minimize losses.
Residential real estate loans that are downgraded to a credit risk rating of 6 through 9 also enter the problem loan reporting system and have the underlying collateral evaluated by the Managed Assets Division.
Premium Finance Receivables
The determination of the appropriate allowance for credit losses for premium finance receivables is an assumption-based approach focusing on historical loss rates in the portfolio, adjusted qualitatively for current macroeconomic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 
Methodology in Assessing Impairment and Charge-off Amounts
In determining the amount of reserves or charge-offs associated with collateral dependent loans, the Company values the loan generally by starting with a valuation obtained from an appraisal of the underlying collateral and then deducting estimated selling costs, if appropriate, to arrive at a net appraised value. We obtain the appraisals of the underlying collateral typically on an annual basis from one of a pre-approved list of independent, third party appraisal firms. Types of appraisal valuations include “as-is,” “as-complete,” “as-stabilized,” bulk, fair market, liquidation and “retail sellout” values.
In many cases, the Company simultaneously values the underlying collateral by marketing the property to market participants interested in purchasing properties of the same type. If the Company receives offers or indications of interest, we will analyze the price and review market conditions to assess whether in light of such information the appraised value overstates the likely price and that a lower price would be a better assessment of the market value of the property and would enable us to liquidate the collateral. Additionally, the Company takes into account the strength of any guarantees or other credit enhancements, and the ability of the borrower to provide value related to those guarantees in determining the ultimate charge-off or reserve associated with any individually assessed loans. Accordingly, the Company may charge-off a loan to a value below the net appraised value if it believes that an expeditious liquidation is desirable in the circumstance and it has legitimate offers or other indications of interest to support a value that is less than the net appraised value. Alternatively, the Company may carry a loan at a value that is in excess of the appraised value if the Company has a guarantee from a borrower or other credit enhancements that the Company believes has realizable value. In evaluating the strength of any guarantee, the Company evaluates the financial wherewithal of the guarantor, the guarantor’s reputation, and the guarantor’s willingness and desire to work with the Company. The Company then conducts a review of the strength of a guarantee on a frequency established as the circumstances and conditions of the borrower warrant.
In circumstances where the Company has received an appraisal but has no third party offers or indications of interest, the Company may enlist the input of realtors in the local market as to the highest valuation that the realtor believes would result in a liquidation of the property given a reasonable marketing period of approximately 90 days. To the extent that the realtors’ indication of market clearing price under such scenario is less than the net appraised valuation, the Company may take a charge-off on the loan to a valuation that is less than the net appraised valuation.
The Company may also charge-off a loan below the net appraised valuation if the Company holds a junior mortgage position in a piece of collateral whereby the risk to acquiring control of the property through the purchase of the senior mortgage position is deemed to potentially increase the risk of loss upon liquidation due to the amount of time to ultimately market the property and the volatile market conditions. In such cases, the Company may abandon its junior mortgage and charge-off the loan balance in full.
In other cases, the Company may allow the borrower to conduct a “short sale,” which is a sale where the Company allows the borrower to sell the property at a value less than the amount of the loan. Many times, it is possible for the current owner to receive a better price than if the property is marketed by a financial institution which the market place perceives to have a greater desire to liquidate the property at a lower price. To the extent that we allow a short sale at a price below the value indicated by an appraisal, we may take a charge-off beyond the value that an appraisal would have indicated.
Other market conditions may require a reserve to bring the carrying value of the loan below the net appraised valuation such as litigation surrounding the borrower and/or property securing our loan or other market conditions impacting the value of the collateral.
86
Having determined the net value based on the factors such as those noted above and compared that value to the book value of the loan, the Company arrives at a charge-off amount or a specific reserve included in the allowance for credit losses. In summary, for collateral dependent loans, appraisals are used as the fair value starting point in the estimate of net value. Estimated costs to sell are deducted from the appraised value, when appropriate under current accounting rules, to arrive at the net appraised value. Although an external appraisal is the primary source of valuation utilized for charge-offs on collateral dependent loans, alternative sources of valuation may become available between appraisal dates. As a result, we may utilize values obtained through these alternative sources, which include purchase and sale agreements, legitimate indications of interest, negotiated short sales, realtor price opinions, sale of the note or support from guarantors, as the basis for charge-offs. These alternative sources of value are used only if deemed to be more representative of value based on updated information regarding collateral resolution. In addition, if an appraisal is not deemed current, a discount to appraised value may be utilized. Any adjustments from appraised value to net value are detailed and justified in an impairment analysis, which is reviewed and approved by the Company’s Managed Assets Division.
Potential Problem Loans
Management believes that any loan where there are serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms should be identified as a non-performing loan and should be included in the disclosure of “Past Due Loans and Non-Performing Assets.” At end of the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company had no potential problem loans not already identified as non-performing.
Other Real Estate Owned
In certain circumstances, the Company is required to take action against the real estate collateral of specific loans. The Company uses foreclosure only as a last resort for dealing with borrowers experiencing financial hardships. The Company employs extensive contact and restructuring procedures to attempt to find other solutions for our borrowers. The tables below present a summary of other real estate owned and show the activity for the respective periods and the balance for each property type:

Deposits and Other Funding Sources
Total deposits at December 31, 2024, were $52.5 billion, increasing $7.1 billion, or 16%, compared to the $45.4 billion at December 31, 2023. Average deposit balances in 2024 were $47.7 billion, reflecting an increase of $4.5 billion, or 10%, compared to the average balances in 2023. 
The increase in year end and average deposits in 2024 over 2023 is primarily attributable to the Company's increased marketing efforts during 2024 to retain and attract deposits to support continued loan growth, the Macatawa acquisition, and due to the diversity of our deposit base. The Company has experienced a change in the mix of deposits as non-interest bearing deposits have migrated to interest-bearing products as rates paid on deposits increased substantially in 2023 due to the rise in market 
87
rates. Average non-interest bearing deposits decreased $806.5 million, or 7% in 2024 compared to 2023, with period end balances ending at 22% of total deposits at December 31, 2024, compared to 23% at December 31, 2023.

Wealth management deposits are funds from the brokerage customers of Wintrust Investments, CDEC and trust and asset management customers of the Company which have been placed into deposit accounts of the banks (“wealth management deposits” in the table above). Wealth management deposits consist primarily of money market accounts. Consistent with reasonable interest rate risk parameters, these funds have generally been invested in loan production of the banks as well as other investments suitable for banks.
Other Funding Sources.
 Although deposits are the Company’s primary source of funding its interest-earning assets, the Company’s ability to manage the types and terms of deposits is somewhat limited by customer preferences and market competition. As a result, in addition to deposits and the issuance of equity securities and the retention of earnings, the Company uses several other funding sources to support its growth. These sources include FHLB advances, notes payable, short-term borrowings, secured borrowings, subordinated debt, and junior subordinated debentures. The Company evaluates the terms and unique characteristics of each source, as well as its asset-liability management position, in determining the use of such funding sources.
The Company had approximately $18.9 billion of uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2024, of which $3.1 billion were fully collateralized deposits. The net position of $15.8 billion of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits represents approximately 30% of total deposits as of December 31, 2024. The Company had total liquidity sources, including cash and collateralized funding sources of $17.4 billion or approximately 110% of uninsured and uncollateralized deposits as of December 31, 2024.

FHLB advances provide the banks with access to fixed-rate funds which are useful in mitigating interest rate risk and achieving an acceptable interest rate spread on fixed-rate loans or securities. FHLB advances to the banks outstanding balance totaled $3.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2023. See Note (11) “Federal Home Loan Bank Advances” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of the terms of these advances.
88
Notes payable balances represent the balances on a credit agreement (as amended, the “Credit Agreement”) with certain unaffiliated banks. The Credit Agreement consists of a $200.0 million term loan facility and a $100.0 million revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2024, the outstanding principal balance under the term loan facility was $142.8 million and there was no outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit facility. See Note (13) “Other Borrowings” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of notes payable. 
Short-term borrowings include securities sold under repurchase agreements of customer sweep accounts in connection with master repurchase agreements at the banks. At December 31, 2024, the Company had none of these types of borrowings compared to $13.4 million at December 31, 2023. This funding category typically fluctuates based on customer preferences and daily liquidity needs of the banks, their customers and the banks’ operating subsidiaries. See Note (13) “Other Borrowings” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of these borrowings.
The balance of secured borrowings primarily represents a third party Canadian transaction (“Canadian Secured Borrowing”). Under the Canadian Secured Borrowing, the Company, through its subsidiary, FIFC Canada, sells an undivided co-ownership interest in all receivables owed to FIFC Canada to an unrelated third party in exchange for cash payments pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement (“Receivables Purchase Agreement”). See Note (13) “Other Borrowings” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of these secured borrowings under this agreement. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the translated balance of the secured borrowings totaled $323.2 million and $392.5 million, respectively.
Other borrowings at December 31, 2024 represent a fixed-rate promissory note (“Fixed-Rate Promissory Note”) issued by the Company in June 2017. Amendments to the Fixed-Rate Promissory Note since issuance increased the principal amount to $66.4 million, reduced the interest rate to 1.70%, and extended the maturity date to March 31, 2025. The Fixed-Rate Promissory Note relates to and is secured by three office buildings owned by the Company. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Fixed-Rate Promissory Note had a balance of $57.1 million and $59.2 million, respectively. See Note (13) “Other Borrowings” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of these borrowings. 
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, subordinated notes totaled $298.3 million and $437.9 million, respectively. During 2019, the Company issued $300.0 million of subordinated notes receiving $296.7 million in proceeds, net of underwriting discount. The notes have a stated interest rate of 4.85% and mature in June 2029. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company repaid the $140.0 million of subordinated notes issued in 2014. The notes had a stated interest rate of 5.00% and matured in June 2024. See Note (12) “Subordinated Notes” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion.
The Company had $253.6 million of junior subordinated debentures outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The amounts reflected on the balance sheet represent the junior subordinated debentures issued to eleven trusts by the Company and equal the amount of the preferred and common securities issued by the trusts. See Note (14) “Junior Subordinated Debentures” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of the Company’s junior subordinated debentures. Starting in 2016, none of the junior subordinated debentures qualified as Tier 1 regulatory capital of the Company resulting in $245.5 million of the junior subordinated debentures, net of common securities, being included in the Company’s Tier 2 regulatory capital as of December 31, 2024.
Shareholders’ Equity
. Total shareholders’ equity was $6.3 billion at December 31, 2024, an increase of $944.8 million from the December 31, 2023 total of $5.4 billion. The increase in 2024 was primarily a result of net income of $695.0 million, common stock issued for acquisition of Macatawa Bank Corporation of $499.2 million, and $38.1 million of stock-based compensation costs credited to surplus.  These increases to total shareholders’ equity were partially offset by $78.9 million in net unrealized losses from investment securities, net of tax, $43.3 million of net unrealized losses on cash flow hedges, net of tax, $24.9 million of foreign currency translation adjustments, net of tax, common stock dividends of $115.3 million and preferred stock dividends of $28.0 million. See Note (23) “Shareholders’ Equity” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion of shareholders’ equity.

The Company and the banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements established by the federal banking agencies that take into account risk attributable to balance sheet and off-balance sheet activities. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory — and possibly discretionary — actions by regulators, that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on the Company’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the banks must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company’s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Federal Reserve’s capital guidelines require bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of 
89
qualifying total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, of which at least 4.5% must be in the form of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and 6.0% must be in the form of Tier 1 capital. The Federal Reserve also requires a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets of greater than 4.0%. In addition, the Federal Reserve continues to consider the Tier 1 leverage ratio in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities.
The following table summarizes the capital guidelines for bank holding companies as of December 31, 2024, as well as certain ratios relating to the Company’s equity and assets as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:

Reflects the well-capitalized standard applicable to the Company for purposes of the Federal Reserve’s Regulation Y. The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for BHCs to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the U.S. Basel III Rule or to add Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio requirements to this standard. As a result, the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 leverage ratio are denoted as “N/A” in this column. If the Federal Reserve were to apply the same or a very similar well-capitalized standard to BHCs as the standard applicable to our subsidiary banks, the Company’s capital ratios as of December 31, 2024 would exceed such revised well-capitalized standard.
As reflected in the table, each of the Company’s capital ratios at December 31, 2024, exceeded the well-capitalized ratios established by the Federal Reserve. Management is committed to maintaining the Company’s capital levels above the “Well Capitalized” levels established by the Federal Reserve for bank holding companies. Refer to Note (19) “Regulatory Matters” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further information on the capital positions of the banks.
The Company’s principal sources of funds at the holding company level are dividends from its subsidiaries, borrowings under its loan agreement with unaffiliated banks and proceeds from the issuances of subordinated debt and additional equity. Refer to Notes (12), (13), (14) and (23) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further information on the Company’s subordinated notes, other borrowings, junior subordinated debentures and shareholders’ equity, respectively. 
In January, April, July and October of 2024 and 2023, Wintrust declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.41 per share and $429.69 per share of Series D and Series E Preferred Stock, respectively.
The payment of common stock dividends is also subject to statutory restrictions and restrictions arising under the terms of the Company’s Series D and Series E Preferred Stock, the Company’s trust preferred securities offerings units and under certain financial covenants in the Company’s revolving and term credit facilities. Under the terms of these separate revolving and term credit facilities, the Company is prohibited from paying dividends on any equity interests, including its common stock and preferred stock, if such payments would cause the Company to be in default under its facilities or exceed a certain threshold. In January, April, July and October of 2024, Wintrust declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per common share. In January, April, July and October of 2023, Wintrust declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per common share. In January of 2025, Wintrust declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per common share. Taking into account the limitations on the payment of dividends, the final determination of timing, amount and payment of dividends is at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and will depend on the Company’s earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other relevant factors.
In June 2022, the Company sold a total of 3,450,000 shares of its common stock through a public offering. Net proceeds to the Company totaled approximately $285.7 million, net of estimated issuance costs.
Banking laws impose restrictions upon the amount of dividends that can be paid to the holding company by the banks. Based on these laws, the banks could, subject to minimum capital requirements, declare dividends to the Company without obtaining 
90
regulatory approval in an amount not exceeding (a) undivided profits, and (b) the amount of net income reduced by dividends paid for the current and prior two years.
Since the banks are required to maintain their capital at the well-capitalized level (due to the Company being a financial holding company), funds otherwise available as dividends from the banks are limited to the amount that would not reduce any of the banks’ capital ratios below the well-capitalized level. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, the subsidiaries paid $475.0 million, $360.0 million and $52.0 million, respectively, in dividends to the Company. As of December 31, 2024, subject to minimum capital requirements at the banks, approximately $932.5 million was available as dividends from the banks without prior regulatory approval and without compromising the banks’ well-capitalized positions. 
Liquidity management at the banks involves planning to meet anticipated funding needs at a reasonable cost. Liquidity management is guided by policies, formulated and monitored by the Company’s senior management and each Bank’s asset/liability committee, which take into account the marketability of assets, the sources and stability of funding and the level of unfunded commitments. The banks’ principal sources of funds are deposits, short-term borrowings and capital contributions from the holding company. In addition, the banks are eligible to borrow under FHLB advances and at the FRB Discount Window, another source of liquidity. 
In accordance with the liquidity management noted above, deposit growth and increases in borrowings from various sources have resulted in accumulating liquidity assets in recent periods. In 2024, we managed our liquid assets to ensure that we have the balance sheet strength to serve our clients. As a result, the Company believes that it has sufficient funds and access to funds to meet its working capital and other needs. The Company will continue to prudently evaluate liquidity sources, including the management of availability with the FHLB and FRB and utilization of the revolving credit facility with unaffiliated banks.
Core deposits are the most stable source of liquidity for community banks due to the nature of long-term relationships generally established with depositors and the security of deposit insurance provided by the FDIC. Core deposits are generally defined in the industry as total deposits less time deposits with balances greater than $100,000. Due to the affluent nature of many of the communities that the Company serves, management believes that many of its time deposits with balances in excess of $100,000 are also a stable source of funds. Currently, standard deposit insurance coverage is $250,000 per depositor per insured bank, for each account ownership category.
While the Company obtains a portion of its total deposits through brokered deposits, the Company does so primarily as an asset-liability management tool to assist in the management of interest rate risk, and the Company does not consider brokered deposits to be a vital component of its current liquidity resources. Historically, brokered deposits have represented a small component of the Company’s total deposits outstanding, as set forth in the table below:

Brokered Deposits include certificates of deposit obtained through deposit brokers, deposits received through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Program, as well as wealth management deposits of brokerage customers from unaffiliated companies which have been placed into deposit accounts of the banks.
The Company’s banks routinely accept deposits from a variety of municipal entities. Typically, these municipal entities require that banks pledge marketable securities to collateralize these public deposits. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the banks had approximately $6.9 billion of securities collateralizing public deposits and other liquidity sources. Public deposits requiring pledged assets are not considered to be core deposits, however they provide the Company with a reliable, lower cost, short-term funding source than what is available through many other wholesale alternatives.
Other than as discussed in this section, the Company is not aware of any known trends, commitments, events, regulatory recommendations or uncertainties that would have any material adverse effect on the Company’s capital resources, operations or liquidity.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
The Company has various financial obligations, including contractual obligations and commitments, that may require future cash payments.
Contractual Obligations. 
Our significant contractual obligations with third parties primarily consist of deposit liabilities and other sources of funding for our businesses, including FHLB advances, subordinated debt, other debt borrowings and junior subordinated debentures. These debt obligations have fixed and determinable contractual repayment dates specific to each type of instrument. Deposit liabilities are primarily due on-demand, with certain time deposits due based on contractual maturities that may exceed one year. Repayment of debt obligations, including junior subordinated debentures, vary based on terms of the underlying debt instrument, with certain debt instruments requiring full repayment of the debt at the respective maturity date and other debt instruments requiring periodic partial repayment over the entire term of the debt instrument. Further information on these debt obligations is included in Notes (10) “Deposits” through (14) “Junior Subordinated Debentures” of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
The Company enters into various leasing arrangements with contractual obligations to pay for use of specified assets over a specific period of time. These leased assets primarily related to certain banking facilities as well as specific signage related to sponsorships and other agreements, and certain automatic teller machines and other equipment. Payments under these obligations are primarily made on a monthly basis. Further information on these lease obligations is included in Note (16) “Lease Commitments” of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
The Company’s other purchase obligations relate to certain contractual cash obligations for acquisition-related contingent costs, marketing obligations and services related to the construction of facilities, data processing and the outsourcing of certain operational activities. In 2024, the Company continued to significantly invest in technology, including enhancements to our customer’s digital experience, and it is subject to additional contractual purchase obligations in furtherance of these efforts. 
The Company also enters into derivative contracts under which the Company is required to either receive cash from or pay cash to counterparties depending on changes in interest rates. Derivative contracts are carried at fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market rates as of the balance sheet date. Further information on derivative contracts is included in Note (21) “Derivative Financial Instruments” of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.
Commitments. 
The following table presents a summary of the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments as of December 31, 2024. Further information on these commitments is included in Note (20) “Commitments and Contingencies” of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.

Our remaining commitment to fund community investments totaled $94.1 million, which includes future cash outlays for the construction and development of properties for low-income housing, support for small businesses, and historic tax credit projects that qualify for CRA purposes. These commitments are not included in the commitments table above, as the timing and amounts are based upon the financing arrangements provided in each project’s partnership or operating agreement and could change due to variances in the construction schedule, project revisions, or the cancellation of the project.  
Contingencies.
 The Company enters into residential mortgage loan sale agreements with investors in the normal course of business. These agreements usually require certain representations concerning credit information, loan documentation, collateral and insurability. On occasion, investors have requested the Company to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans which the investors believe do not comply with applicable representations.  Upon completion of its own investigation, the Company generally repurchases or provides indemnification on certain loans. Indemnification requests 
92
are generally received within two years subsequent to sale. Management maintains a liability for estimated losses on loans expected to be repurchased or on which indemnification is expected to be provided and regularly evaluates the adequacy of this recourse liability based on trends in repurchase and indemnification requests, actual loss experience, known and inherent risks in the loans, and current economic conditions. At December 31, 2024, the liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification was approximately $188,000 and was included in other liabilities on the balance sheet.
Forward Looking Statements
This document contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Forward-looking information can be identified through the use of words such as “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “contemplate,” “possible,” “will,” “may,” “should,” “would” and “could.” Forward-looking statements and information are not historical facts, are premised on many factors and assumptions, and represent only management’s expectations, estimates and projections regarding future events. Similarly, these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. The Company intends such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward- looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and is including this statement for purposes of invoking these safe harbor provisions. Such forward-looking statements may be deemed to include, among other things, statements relating to the Company’s future financial performance, the performance of its loan portfolio, the expected amount of future credit reserves and charge-offs, delinquency trends, growth plans, regulatory developments, securities that the Company may offer from time to time, plans to form additional de novo banks or branch offices, and management’s long-term performance goals, as well as statements relating to the anticipated effects on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations from expected developments or events, the Company’s business and growth strategies, including future acquisitions of banks, specialty finance or wealth management businesses, internal growth and plans to form additional de novo banks or branch offices. Actual results could differ materially from those addressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of numerous factors and uncertainties, including those discussed in the Risk Factors and summary thereof disclosed under Item 1A of this Annual Report on 10-K and in any of the Company’s subsequent SEC filings.
Therefore, there can be no assurances that future actual results will correspond to any forward-looking statements. The reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement made by the Company. Any such statement speaks only as of the date the statement was made or as of such date that may be referenced within the statement. The Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Persons are advised, however, to consult further disclosures management makes on related subjects in its reports filed with the SEC and in its press releases.
ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS
Effects of Inflation
A banking organization’s assets and liabilities are primarily monetary. Changes in the rate of inflation do not have as great an impact on the financial condition of a bank as do changes in interest rates. Moreover, interest rates do not necessarily change at the same percentage as inflation. Accordingly, changes in inflation are not expected to have a material impact on the Company.
Asset-Liability Management
As an ongoing part of its financial strategy, the Company attempts to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income. This effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and maintenance of yield. Asset-liability management policies are established and monitored by management in conjunction with the boards of directors of the banks, subject to general oversight by the Risk Management Committee of the Company’s Board. The policies establish guidelines for acceptable limits on the sensitivity of the market value of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates.
Interest rate risk arises when the maturity or re-pricing periods and interest rate indices of the interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities, and derivative financial instruments are different. It is the risk that changes in the level of market interest rates will result in disproportionate changes in the value of, and the net earnings generated from, the Company’s interest-earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and derivative financial instruments. The Company continuously monitors not only the organization’s current net interest margin, but also the historical trends of these margins. In addition, management attempts to identify potential adverse changes in net interest income in future years as a result interest rate fluctuations by performing simulation analysis of various interest rate environments. If a potential adverse change in net interest margin and/or net income is identified, management takes appropriate action with its asset-liability structure to mitigate these potentially adverse 
93
situations. Please refer to Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further discussion of the net interest margin.
Since the Company’s primary source of interest-bearing liabilities is from customer deposits, the Company’s ability to manage the types and terms of such deposits is somewhat limited by customer preferences and local competition in the market areas in which the banks operate. The rates, terms and interest rate indices of the Company’s interest-earning assets result primarily from the Company’s strategy of investing in loans and securities that permit the Company to limit its exposure to interest rate risk, together with credit risk, while at the same time achieving an acceptable interest rate spread.
The Company’s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on a regular basis by management and the Risk Management Committees of the boards of directors of the banks and the Company. The objective of the review is to measure the effect on net income and to adjust balance sheet and derivative financial instruments to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximize net interest income. 
The following interest rate scenarios display the percentage change in net interest income over a one-year time horizon assuming increases and decreases of 100 and 200 basis points as compared to projected net interest income in a scenario with no assumed rate changes. The Static Shock Scenario results incorporate actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for balance sheet instruments following an instantaneous, parallel change in market rates based upon a static (i.e. no growth or constant) balance sheet. Conversely, the Ramp Scenario results incorporate management’s projections of future volume and pricing of each of the product lines following a gradual, parallel change in market rates over twelve months. Actual results may differ from these simulated results due to timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies. The interest rate sensitivity for both the Static Shock and Ramp Scenario at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is as follows:

One method utilized by financial institutions, including the Company, to manage interest rate risk is to enter into derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments include interest rate swaps, interest rate caps, floors and collars, futures, forwards, option contracts and other financial instruments with similar characteristics. Additionally, the Company enters into commitments to fund certain mortgage loans (interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of mortgage loans to third party investors. See Note (21) “Derivative Financial Instruments” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Company’s derivative financial instruments.
As shown above, at December 31, 2024, the magnitude of potential changes in net interest income in various interest rate scenarios has continued to remain relatively neutral. As the current interest rate cycle progressed, management took action to reposition its sensitivity to interest rates. To this end, management has executed various derivative instruments including collars and receive-fixed swaps to hedge variable-rate loan exposures. The Company will continue to monitor current and projected interest rates and may execute additional derivatives to mitigate potential fluctuations in the net interest margin in future periods.
During 2024 and 2023, the Company entered into certain covered call option transactions related to certain securities held by the Company. The Company uses these option transactions (rather than entering into other derivative interest rate contracts, such as interest rate floors) to economically hedge positions and compensate for net interest margin compression by increasing the total return associated with the related securities through fees generated from these options. Although the revenue received from these options is recorded as non-interest income rather than interest income, the increased return attributable to the related securities from these options contributes to the Company’s overall profitability. The Company’s exposure to interest rate risk may be impacted by these transactions. To further mitigate this risk, the Company may acquire fixed-rate term debt or use 
94
financial derivative instruments. There were no covered call options outstanding as of December 31, 2024 or 2023. See Note (21) “Derivative Financial Instruments” of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Company’s fees from covered call options for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Wintrust Financial Corporation 
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of condition of Wintrust Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.  Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter 
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.
96
Allowance for credit losses
Description of the Matter
At December 31, 2024, the Company’s allowance for credit losses (ACL) was $437.1 million. As more fully described in Notes (1) and (5) to the consolidated financial statements, the ACL represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual term of the loan. The ACL is measured on a collective or pooled basis when assets share the same risk characteristics or on an individual basis when assets do not share similar risk characteristics. For assets measured on a collective basis, the Company applies modeling methodologies that utilize the Company’s historical loss experience to estimate lifetime credit loss rates on each pool, including methodologies estimating the probability of default and loss given default on specific segments. The historical credit loss experience utilized in the ACL models is adjusted for the Company’s reasonable and supportable economic forecasts. The modeled results are then adjusted for certain qualitative factors. For assets measured on an individual basis, the Company measures the expected losses primarily based on the estimated collateral value.
Auditing management’s estimate of the ACL was especially challenging due to the complexity of the Company’s ACL models, the significant judgment required in establishing management’s reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, and the significant judgment required in developing and applying management’s qualitative factors.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the ACL process, including, among other things, controls over management’s process for the development, operation and monitoring of the ACL models, assessing and challenging the reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, the development and application of qualitative factors, and verifying the completeness and accuracy of key inputs and assumptions used in the ACL models.
To test the Company’s ACL models, we involved our specialists to test a sample of the ACL models by evaluating model methodology, model performance and testing key modeling assumptions.  Additionally, we tested the accuracy of data utilized in the models by agreeing key data fields to source documentation and performed targeted re-calculations for a sample of models.
To test the reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, our audit procedures included among others, evaluating the basis of the economic forecast factors utilized by management and testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by management to develop the economic forecasts.
To test the qualitative factors, among other procedures, we assessed management’s methodology and considered whether relevant risks were reflected in the models and whether qualitative adjustments to the model outputs were appropriate. We tested the completeness, accuracy and relevance of the underlying data used to estimate the qualitative factors. We evaluated whether qualitative factors were reasonable based on changes in economic conditions and the composition of the loan portfolio.
In addition, we evaluated the overall ACL and whether the ACL appropriately reflects expected lifetime losses in the loan portfolio as of the consolidated balance sheet date. For example, we compared the overall ACL amount to those established by similar banking institutions with similar loan portfolios.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The accounting and reporting policies of Wintrust Financial Corporation (“Wintrust” or the “Company”) and its subsidiaries conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and prevailing practices of the banking industry. In the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts contained in the consolidated financial statements. Management believes that the estimates made are reasonable; however, changes in estimates may be required if economic or other conditions change beyond management’s expectations. Reclassifications of certain prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation. The following is a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of Wintrust include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.
Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution that would occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then share in the earnings of the Company. The weighted-average number of common shares outstanding is increased by the assumed conversion of any outstanding convertible preferred stock shares from the beginning of the year or date of issuance, if later, and the number of common shares that would be issued assuming the exercise of stock options and the issuance of restricted shares using the treasury stock method. The adjustments to the weighted-average common shares outstanding are only made when such adjustments will dilute earnings per common share. If relevant convertible preferred shares are outstanding during a period, net income applicable to common shares used in the diluted earnings per share calculation may be adjusted to consider potential conversion of such preferred shares. Where the effect of this conversion would reduce the loss per share or increase the income per share, net income applicable to common shares is not adjusted by the associated preferred dividends.
Business Combinations
The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”) when it obtains control of a business. When determining whether a business has been acquired, the Company first evaluates whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired are concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If concentrated in such a manner, the set of assets and activities is not a business. If not concentrated in such a manner, the Company assesses whether the set meets the definition of a business by containing inputs, outputs and at least one substantive process. If the set represents a business, the Company recognizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, immediately expenses transaction costs and accounts for restructuring plans separately from the business combination. The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Alternatively, a gain is recorded equal to the amount by which the fair value of assets purchased exceeds the fair value of liabilities assumed and consideration paid.
If the set of assets and activities do not constitute a business, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. The cost of a group of assets acquired is allocated to the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed based on the relative fair value and does not result in the recognition of goodwill. Generally, any excess of the cost of the transaction over the fair value of the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed, or, in contrast, any excess of the fair value of the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed over the cost of the transaction, should be allocated on a relative fair value basis. Certain "non-qualifying" assets are excluded from this allocation, and are recognized at the individual asset's fair value.
Results of operations of the acquired business are included in the income statement from the effective date of acquisition. Subsequent adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified in reporting periods within one year after the acquisition date in a business combination are recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.

103
Cash Equivalents
For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, Wintrust considers cash on hand, cash items in the process of collection, non-interest bearing amounts due from correspondent banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements with original maturities of three months or less, to be cash equivalents.
 There were 
no
 securities sold under agreements to repurchase with original maturities of three months or less at December 31, 2024.
Investment Securities
The Company classifies debt and equity securities upon purchase in one of five categories: trading, held-to-maturity debt securities, available-for-sale debt securities, equity securities with a readily determinable fair value or equity securities without a readily determinable fair value. Debt and equity securities held for resale are classified as trading securities. Debt securities for which the Company has the ability and positive intent to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. All other debt securities are classified as available-for-sale as they may be sold prior to maturity in response to changes in the Company’s interest rate risk profile, funding needs, demand for collateralized deposits by public entities or other reasons. Equity securities are classified based upon whether a readily determinable fair value exists on such security. The fair value of an equity security is readily determinable if it meets certain conditions, including whether sales prices or bid-ask quotes are currently available on certain securities exchanges; traded only in a foreign market that is of a breadth and scope comparable to one of the U.S. markets; or the security is an investment in a mutual fund or similar structure with a fair value per share or unit that is determined and published, and is the basis for current transactions.
Held-to-maturity debt securities are stated at amortized cost, which represents actual cost adjusted for premium amortization and discount accretion using methods that approximate the effective interest method. Available-for-sale debt securities are stated at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of related taxes, included in shareholders’ equity as a separate component of other comprehensive income. Trading account securities and equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are stated at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from sales and fair value adjustments are included in other non-interest income. Equity securities without a readily determinable fair value are stated at either a calculated net asset value per share, if available, or the cost of the security minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar instrument of the same issuer.
Subsequent to classification at the time of purchase, the Company may transfer debt securities between trading, held-to-maturity, or available-for-sale. For debt securities transferred to trading, the current unrealized gain or loss at the date of transfer, net of related taxes, is immediately recognized in earnings.  Debt securities transferred from trading to either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale have already recognized any unrealized gain or loss into earnings and this amount is not reversed. Unrealized gains or losses, net related taxes, for available-for-sale debt securities transferred to held-to-maturity remain as a separate component of other comprehensive income and an offsetting discount or premium is included in the amortized cost of the held-to-maturity debt security. These amounts are amortized over the remaining life of the debt security in equal and offsetting amounts. Unrealized gains or losses for held-to-maturity debt securities transferred to available-for-sale are recognized at the transfer date as a separate component of other comprehensive income, net of related taxes.
Declines in the fair value of held-to-maturity and available-for-sale debt investment securities (with certain exceptions for debt securities noted below) that are deemed to be credit losses are charged to the allowance for credit losses. In evaluating credit impairment, management considers the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value in the near term. Declines in the fair value of debt securities below amortized cost are deemed to be credit losses in circumstances where: (1) the Company has the intent to sell a security; (2) it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the debt security. If the Company intends to sell a debt security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security before recovery, a credit impairment write-down is recognized in the allowance for credit losses equal to the difference between the debt security’s amortized cost basis and its fair value. If an entity does not intend to sell the debt security or it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security before recovery, the credit impairment write-down is separated into an amount representing credit loss, which is recognized in the allowance for credit losses, and an amount related to all other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income.
Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are measured at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Such 
104
investments are included within accrued interest receivable and other assets within the Company's Consolidated Statements of Condition. 
Interest and dividends, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, are recognized as interest income when earned. Realized gains and losses on sales (using the specific identification method), unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary are included in non-interest income.
FHLB and FRB Stock
Investments in FHLB and FRB stock are restricted as to redemption and are carried at cost.
Securities Purchased Under Resale Agreements and Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements
Securities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold under repurchase agreements are generally treated as collateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the amount at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. Securities, consisting of U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government agency and mortgage-backed securities, pledged as collateral under these financing arrangements cannot be sold by the secured party. The fair value of collateral either received from or provided to a third party is monitored and additional collateral is obtained or requested to be returned as deemed appropriate.
Brokerage Customer Receivables
The Company, under an agreement with an out-sourced securities clearing firm, extends credit to its brokerage customers to finance their purchases of securities on margin. The Company receives income from interest charged on such extensions of credit. Brokerage customer receivables represent amounts due on margin balances. Securities owned by customers are held as collateral for these receivables.
Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale
Mortgage loans are classified as held-for-sale when originated or acquired with the intent to sell the loan into the secondary market. ASC 825, “Financial Instruments” provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Mortgage loans classified as held-for-sale are measured at fair value which is typically determined by reference to investor prices for loan products with similar characteristics. Changes in fair value are recognized in mortgage banking revenue. 
Market conditions or other developments may change management’s intent with respect to the disposition of these loans and loans previously classified as mortgage loans held-for-sale may be reclassified to the loans held-for-investment portfolio, with the balance transferred continuing to be carried at fair value.
Loans and Leases
Loans are generally reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income. Interest income is recognized when earned. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and amortized over the expected life of the loan as an adjustment to the yield using methods that approximate the effective interest method. Finance charges on premium finance receivables are earned over the term of the loan, using a method which approximates the effective yield method.
Leases classified as direct financing leases are included within lease loans, net of unearned income, for financial statement purposes. Direct financing    leases are stated as the sum of remaining minimum lease payments from lessees plus estimated residual values less unearned lease income.  Unearned lease income on direct financing leases is recognized over the term of the leases using the effective interest method.
Interest income is not accrued on loans where management has determined that the borrowers may be unable to meet contractual principal or interest obligations, or where interest or principal is 90 days or more past due, unless the loans are adequately secured and in the process of collection. Cash receipts on non-accrual loans are generally applied to the principal balance until the remaining balance is considered collectible, at which time interest income may be recognized when received.  
Allowance for Credit Losses
In accordance with ASC 326, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses” (“ASC 326”), the Company measures the allowance for credit losses at the time of origination or purchase of a financial asset, representing an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses on the related asset. Financial assets include assets measured under the amortized cost basis, including loans, net investments in 
105
leases recognized by a lessor, held-to-maturity debt securities and purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) assets at the time of and subsequent to acquisition, and off-balance-sheet credit exposures considered not unconditionally cancellable. In addition to financial assets measured at amortized cost, credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities are recorded through the allowance for credit losses and not as a direct adjustment to the amortized cost of the securities. The Company elects the collateral maintenance practical expedient under ASC 326 and applies this approach to securities purchased under resale agreements and brokerage customer receivables. In accordance with contractual terms, these assets require underlying collateral to be monitored continuously and replenished when collateral is less than required levels. The Company measures an allowance for credit losses if the carrying balance of such assets exceeds the amount of underlying collateral.
The allowance for credit losses on financial assets held at amortized cost is measured on a collective or pooled basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The Company utilizes modeling methodologies that estimate lifetime credit loss rates on each pool, including methodologies estimating the probability of default and loss given default on specific segments. Credit quality indicators, specifically the Company's internal risk rating systems, reflect how the Company monitors credit losses and represent factors used by the Company when measuring the allowance for credit losses. Historical credit loss history is adjusted for reasonable and supportable forecasts developed by the Company and incorporates third party economic forecasts on a quantitative or qualitative basis. Reasonable and supportable forecasts consider the macroeconomic factors that are most relevant to evaluating and predicting expected credit losses in the Company's financial assets. For periods beyond the ability to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts, the Company reverts to historical loss rates. Qualitative factors assessed by Management include the following:
•
Changes in the nature and volume of the institution’s financial assets;
•
Changes in the existence, growth, and effect of any concentrations of credit;
•
Changes in the volume and severity of past due financial assets, the volume of non-accrual assets, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded assets;
•
Changes in the value of the underlying collateral for loans that are not collateral-dependent;
•
Changes in the institution’s lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and practices for collections, write-offs, and recoveries;
•
Changes in the quality of the institution’s credit review function;
•
Changes in the experience, ability, and depth of the institution’s lending, investment, collection, and other relevant management and staff;
•
The effect of changes in other external factors such as the regulatory, legal and technological environments; competition; and events such as natural disasters; and
•
Actual and expected changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments in which the institution operates that affect the collectability of financial assets.
Expected credit losses are measured over the contractual term of the financial asset with consideration of expected prepayments. Expected extensions, renewals or modifications of the financial asset are considered when the expected extension, renewal or modification is contained within the existing agreement and is not unconditionally cancellable.
Financial assets that do not share similar risk characteristics with any pool are assessed for the allowance for credit losses on an individual basis. These typically include assets experiencing financial difficulties, including substandard non-accrual assets. If an individual asset is removed from a pool, the allowance for credit losses for such pool will be measured without considering the removed asset. If foreclosure is probable or the asset is considered collateral-dependent, expected credit losses are measured based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral adjusted for selling costs, if appropriate. 
For purchased financial assets that have experienced more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination (“PCD assets”), the Company recognizes the sum of the purchase price and estimate of the allowance for credit losses as of the date of acquisition as the initial amortized cost basis. If the estimated allowance for credit losses is recognized under a methodology that is not a discounted cash flow methodology, such allowance for credit losses will be estimated based upon the unpaid principal balance of the financial asset.
The Company does not measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable balances if these balances are written off in a timely manner. Write-offs of accrued interest receivable balances are recorded as a reduction to interest income.
Recoveries of financial assets previously written off are recognized when received and recorded as a component of the allowance for credit losses. When measuring the allowance for credit losses, the Company incorporates an estimate of expected recoveries provided the estimate is reasonable and supportable. Write-offs of financial assets are charged-off or deducted from the allowance for credit losses and recorded in the period when the Company concludes that all or a portion of a financial asset is no longer collectible. A provision for credit losses is charged to income based on Management’s periodic evaluation of the factors previously described. Evaluations are conducted at least quarterly and more frequently if deemed necessary.
106
Mortgage Servicing Rights ("MSRs")
MSRs are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Condition at fair value in accordance with ASC 860, “Transfers and Servicing.” The Company originates mortgage loans for sale to the secondary market. Certain loans are originated and sold with servicing rights retained. MSRs associated with loans originated and sold, where servicing is retained, are capitalized at the time of sale at fair value based on the future net cash flows expected to be realized for performing the servicing activities, and included in other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. The change in the fair value of MSRs is recorded as a component of mortgage banking revenue in non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company measures the fair value of MSRs by stratifying the servicing rights into pools based on homogeneous characteristics, such as product type and interest rate. The fair value of each servicing rights pool is calculated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with that pool, given current market conditions. Estimates of fair value include assumptions about prepayment speeds, interest rates and other factors which are subject to change over time. Changes in these underlying assumptions could cause the fair value of MSRs to change significantly in the future.
Lease Investments 
The Company’s investments in equipment and other assets held on operating leases are reported as lease investments, net. Rental income on operating leases is recognized as income over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Equipment and other assets held on operating leases is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of the cost of the assets held on operating leases, less any residual value, is computed using the straight-line method over the term of the leases, which is generally 
seven years
 or less.

Premises and Equipment
Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Useful lives generally range from 
two
 to 
15
 years for furniture, fixtures and equipment, 
two
 to 
seven years
 for software and computer-related equipment and 
seven
 to 
39
 years for buildings and improvements. Land improvements are amortized over a period of 
15
 years and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the respective lease including any lease renewals deemed to be reasonably assured. Land, antique furnishings and artwork are not subject to depreciation. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized, and maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Eligible costs related to the configuration, coding, testing and installation of internal use software and qualifying cloud computing arrangements are capitalized.
Long-lived depreciable assets are evaluated periodically for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment exists when the expected undiscounted future cash flows of a long-lived asset are less than its carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the asset based on a quoted market price, if applicable, or a discounted cash flow analysis. Impairment losses are recognized in other non-interest expense.
Other Real Estate Owned
Other real estate owned is comprised of real estate acquired in partial or full satisfaction of loans and is included in other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Other real estate owned is recorded at its estimated fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of transfer. Any excess of the related loan balance over the fair value less expected selling costs is charged to the allowance for credit losses. In contrast, any excess of the fair value less expected selling costs over the related loan balance is recorded as a recovery of prior charge-offs on the loan and, if any portion of the excess exceeds prior charge-offs, as an increase to earnings. Subsequent changes in value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount, limited to the initial fair value recorded at the date of transfer, and are recorded in other non-interest expense. Gains and losses upon sale, if any, are also charged to other non-interest expense.
 At December 31, 2024 and 2023, other real estate owned totaled $
23.1
 million and $
13.3
 million, respectively.
107
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract, asset or liability. In accordance with accounting standards, goodwill is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when events warrant, using a qualitative or quantitative approach.  Intangible assets which have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and also are subject to impairment testing. Intangible assets which have indefinite lives are evaluated each reporting date to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. If an indefinite useful life can no longer be supported for such asset, the intangible asset will be amortized prospectively over the remaining estimated useful life. If an indefinite useful life can be supported, the asset is not amortized, but rather is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when events warrant, using a qualitative or quantitative approach. The Company’s intangible assets having finite lives are amortized over varying periods not exceeding 
twenty years
.

Bank-Owned Life Insurance ("BOLI")
The Company maintains BOLI on certain individuals. BOLI balances are recorded at their cash surrender values and are included in other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Changes in the cash surrender values are included in non-interest income.
 At December 31, 2024 and 2023, BOLI totaled $
219.5
 million and $
160.2
 million, respectively.
Derivative Instruments
The Company enters into derivative transactions principally to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements on the future cash flows or the value of certain assets and liabilities. The Company is also required to recognize certain contracts and commitments, including certain commitments to fund mortgage loans held-for-sale, as derivatives when the characteristics of those contracts and commitments meet the definition of a derivative. The Company accounts for derivatives in accordance with ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging,” which requires that all derivative instruments be recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Condition at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship.
Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or liability attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Formal documentation of the relationship between a derivative instrument and a hedged asset or liability, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction and an assessment of effectiveness, is required at inception to apply hedge accounting. In addition, formal documentation of ongoing effectiveness testing is required to maintain hedge accounting.
Fair value hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and the changes in the fair value related to the risk being hedged of the hedged asset or liability on the statement of condition with corresponding offsets recorded in the income statement. The adjustment to the hedged asset or liability is included in the basis of the hedged item, while the fair value of the derivative is recorded as a freestanding asset or liability. Actual cash receipts or payments and related amounts accrued during the period on derivatives included in a fair value hedge relationship are recorded as adjustments to the interest income or expense recorded on the hedged asset or liability.
Cash flow hedges are accounted for by recording the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument on the statement of condition as either a freestanding asset or liability, with a corresponding offset recorded in other comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity, net of deferred taxes. Amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense in the period or periods the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
Under both the fair value and cash flow hedge scenarios, changes in the fair value of derivatives not considered to be highly effective in hedging the change in fair value or the expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized in earnings as non-interest income during the period of the change.
Derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges according to accounting guidance are reported on the statement of condition at fair value and the changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as non-interest income during the period of the change.
108
Commitments to fund mortgage loans (i.e. interest rate locks) to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of these mortgage loans are accounted for as derivatives and are not designated in hedging relationships. Fair values of these mortgage derivatives are estimated primarily based on changes in mortgage rates from the date of the commitments. Changes in the fair values of these derivatives are included in mortgage banking revenue.
Forward currency and commodity contracts used to manage foreign exchange risk and commodity price risk, respectively, associated with certain assets are accounted for as derivatives and are not designated in hedging relationships. Such derivatives are recorded at fair value based on prevailing currency and commodity exchange rates at the measurement date.  Changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings as non-interest income during the period of change.
Periodically, the Company sells options to an unrelated bank or dealer for the right to purchase certain securities held within its investment portfolios (“covered call options”). These option transactions are designed primarily as an economic hedge to compensate for net interest margin compression by increasing the total return associated with holding the related securities as earning assets by using fee income generated from these options. These transactions are not designated in hedging relationships pursuant to accounting guidance and, accordingly, changes in fair values of these contracts, are reported in other non-interest income. 
The Company periodically purchases options for the right to purchase securities not currently held within its investment portfolios or enters into interest rate swaps in which the Company elects to not designate such derivatives as hedging instruments. These option and swap transactions are designed primarily to economically hedge a portion of the fair value adjustments related to the Company’s mortgage servicing rights portfolio. The gain or loss associated with these derivative contracts are included in mortgage banking revenue.

Trust Assets, Assets Under Management and Brokerage Assets
Assets held in fiduciary or agency capacity for customers are not included in the consolidated financial statements as they are not assets of Wintrust or its subsidiaries. Fee income is recognized on an accrual basis and is included as a component of non-interest income.
Income Taxes
Wintrust and its subsidiaries file a consolidated Federal income tax return. Income tax expense is based upon income in the consolidated financial statements rather than amounts reported on the income tax return. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using currently enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as an income tax benefit or income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date.
Positions taken in the Company’s tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, uncertain tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the positions will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions are both initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 
50
% likely of being realized upon settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Interest and penalties on income tax uncertainties are classified within income tax expense in the income statement.
The Company has elected to apply the deferral method for acquired investments that generate investment tax credits (ITCs). This includes solar tax credit investments. Under this approach, the ITCs are recorded as an offset to the related investment on the balance sheet, with credit amounts being recognized in earnings over the life of the investment within the same income or expense accounts as used for the investment.
Stock-Based Compensation Plans
In accordance with ASC 718, “Compensation — Stock Compensation,” compensation cost is measured as the fair value of the awards on their date of grant. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options and a Monte-Carlo simulation model is used to estimate the fair value of performance awards with a market condition metric. The market price of the Company’s stock at the date of grant is used to estimate the fair value of time-vested restricted stock awards and performance awards with a performance metric. Compensation cost is recognized over the required service period, generally 
109
defined as the vesting period. For awards with graded vesting, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.
Accounting guidance permits for the recognition of stock based compensation for the number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest. As a result, recognized compensation expense for stock options and restricted share awards is reduced for estimated forfeitures prior to vesting. Forfeitures rates are estimated for each type of award based on historical forfeiture experience. Estimated forfeitures will be reassessed in subsequent periods and may change based on new facts and circumstances. The Company issues new shares to satisfy option exercises and vesting of restricted shares.
Comprehensive Income
Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, net of deferred taxes, changes in deferred unrealized gains and losses on investment securities transferred from available-for-sale debt securities to held-to-maturity debt securities, net of deferred taxes, adjustments related to cash flow hedges, net of deferred taxes, and foreign currency translation adjustments, net of deferred taxes. The Company has a policy for releasing the income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income using an individual security approach.
Stock Repurchases
The Company periodically repurchases shares of its outstanding common stock through open market purchases or other methods. Repurchased shares are recorded as treasury shares on the trade date using the treasury stock method, and the cash paid is recorded as treasury stock.
Foreign Currency Translation 
The Company revalues assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars at the end of each month using applicable exchange rates and  revenue and expenses are revalued using a daily spot rate.

Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency financial statements for U.S. reporting are included in other comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to the re-measurement of transactions to the functional currency are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Going Concern
In connection with preparing financial statements for each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, exist that would raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. If substantial doubt exists, specific disclosures are required to be included in the Company's financial statements issued. Through its evaluation, the Company did not identify any conditions or events that would raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.
Accounting Pronouncements and Other Regulatory Rules Newly Adopted
Equity Method and Joint Ventures - Investments in Tax Credit Structures
In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, “Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method,” which allows reporting entities the option to apply the proportional amortization method to other tax credit programs besides the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit structures. The guidance requires application of the proportional amortization method on a tax-credit-program-by-tax-credit-program basis rather than electing the method at the reporting level entity level. The Company adopted ASU No. 2023-02 as of January 1, 2024. Adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Segment Reporting
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” to enhance public entity disclosures regarding significant segment expenses which are regularly reported to an entity’s chief operating decision-maker (“CODM”) and included in a segment’s reported profit or loss. This ASU requires disclosure of the amount and composition of “other segment items”, the title and position of the CODM, and how the CODM 
110
uses reported measures of profit or loss to assess segment performance. Further, the guidance requires certain segment disclosures previously provided only annually, on an interim basis. The Company adopted ASU No. 2023-07 as of January 1, 2024. Refer to Note (24) “Segment Information” for further information regarding the adoption of this standard.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Income Tax Disclosures
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. This ASU requires annually that all entities disclose increasingly disaggregated information on amount of income taxes paid. Further, this ASU requires annually that all public entities must disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a specific quantitative threshold. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and is to be applied either on prospective basis or retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The Company expects that adopting this new guidance will have an impact to disclosures only.
Compensation

– Scope Application of Profits Interest and Similar Awards
In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-01, “Compensation

– 
Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope Application of Profits Interest and Similar Awards” which clarifies the guidance by providing an illustrative example to demonstrate how an entity should apply the scope guidance in Topic 718 when determining whether profits interest and similar awards should be accounted for in accordance with Topic 718. For public business entities, this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods therein, and is to be applied either on a prospective basis or retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitte
d. The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, “Income Statement 
– 
Reporting Comprehensive Income 
– 
Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses”, which requires public business entities to disclose additional information about specific expense categories including employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, etc., as well as qualitative descriptions of certain expenses, in the notes to the financial statements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. The guidance is to be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. Early adoption is permitt
ed. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements.
Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-04, “Debt 
– 
Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20): Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments” to clarify the requirements for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments should be accounted for as an induced conversion. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025, including interim periods therein, and is to be applied either on a prospective basis or retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitt
ed. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new guidance on the consolidated financial statements.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values totaled $
65.1
 million as of December 31, 2024 and $
60.0
 million as of December 31, 2023. Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are included as part of accrued interest receivable and other assets in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Condition. The Company monitors its equity investments without readily determinable fair values to identify potential transactions that may indicate an observable price change in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, requiring adjustment to its carrying amount. The Company recorded 
no
 upward and 
no
 downward adjustments related to such observable price changes in 2024 or 2023. The Company conducts a quarterly assessment of its equity securities without readily determinable fair values to determine whether impairment exists in such equity securities, considering, among other factors, the nature of the securities, financial condition of the issuer and expected future cash flows. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $
3.7
 million and $
688,000
, respectively, of impairment of equity securities without readily determinable fair values.

The Company conducts a regular assessment of its investment securities to determine whether securities are experiencing credit losses. Factors for consideration include the nature of the securities, credit ratings or financial condition of the issuer, the extent of the unrealized loss, expected cash flows, market conditions and the Company’s ability to hold the securities through the anticipated recovery period.
The Company does not consider available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses at December 31, 2024 to be experiencing credit losses and recognized no resulting allowance for credit losses for such individually assessed credit losses. The Company does not intend to sell these investments and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell these investments before recovery of the amortized cost bases, which may be the maturity dates of the securities. The unrealized losses within each category have occurred as a result of changes in interest rates, market spreads and market conditions subsequent to purchase. Available-for-sale securities with continuous unrealized losses existing for more than twelve months at December 31, 2024 were primarily mortgage-backed securities with unrealized losses due to increased market rates during such period.
113
See Note (5) “Allowance for Credit Losses” for further discussion regarding any credit losses associated with held-to-maturity securities at December 31, 2024.

The Company’s loan portfolio is generally comprised of loans to consumers and small to medium-sized businesses, which, for the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios, are located primarily within the geographic market areas that the banks serve. Various niche lending businesses, including lease finance and franchise lending, operate on a national level.  The premium finance receivables portfolios are made to customers throughout the United States and Canada. The Company strives to maintain a loan portfolio that is diverse in terms of loan type, industry, borrower and geographic concentrations. Such diversification reduces the exposure to economic downturns that may occur in different segments of the economy or in different industries.
Certain premium finance receivables are recorded net of unearned income. The unearned income portions of such premium finance receivables were $
267.7
 million and $
285.4
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
Total loans, excluding PCD loans, include net deferred loan fees and costs and fair value purchase accounting adjustments totaling $
78.2
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
84.2
 million at December 31, 2023. 
Certain real estate loans, including mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial, consumer, and home equity loans with balances totaling approximately $
23.7
 billion and $
21.1
 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were pledged as collateral to secure the availability of borrowings from certain federal agency banks. At December 31, 2024, approximately $
15.1
 billion of these pledged loans are included in a pledge of qualifying loans to the FHLB. The remaining $
8.6
 billion of pledged loans was used to secure potential borrowings at the FRB discount window. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the banks had outstanding borrowings of $
3.2
 billion and $
2.3
 billion from the FHLB in connection with these collateral arrangements. See Note (11) “Federal Home Loan Bank Advances” for a summary of these borrowings.
It is the policy of the Company to review each prospective credit in order to determine the appropriateness and, when required, the adequacy of security or collateral necessary to obtain when making a loan. The type of collateral, when required, will vary from liquid assets to real estate. The Company seeks to assure access to collateral, in the event of default, through adherence to state lending laws and the Company’s credit monitoring procedures.

Allowance for Credit Losses

In accordance with ASC 326, the Company is required to measure the allowance for credit losses of financial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective or pooled basis. In considering the segmentation of financial assets measured at amortized cost into pools, the Company considered various risk characteristics in its analysis. Generally, the segmentation utilized represents the level at which the Company develops and documents its systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses for the financial asset held at amortized cost, specifically the Company’s loan portfolio and debt securities classified as held-to-maturity. Below is a summary of the Company’s loan portfolio segments and major debt security types:
Commercial loans:
 The Company makes commercial loans for many purposes, including working capital lines and leasing arrangements, that are generally renewable annually and supported by business assets, personal guarantees and additional collateral. Underlying collateral includes receivables, inventory, enterprise value and the assets of the business. Commercial business lending is generally considered to involve a slightly higher degree of risk than traditional consumer bank lending. This portfolio includes a range of industries, including manufacturing, restaurants, franchise, professional services, equipment finance and leasing, mortgage warehouse lending and industrial. Individually assessed collateral dependent commercial loans are primarily collateralized by equipment and the enterprise value or assets of the specific business.
Commercial real estate loans, including construction and development, and non-construction:
 The Company’s commercial real estate loans are generally secured by a first mortgage lien and assignment of rents on the underlying property (utilized in related assessment of individually assessed collateral dependent loans). Since most of the Company’s bank branches are located in the Chicago metropolitan area, southern Wisconsin, and west Michigan, a significant portion of the Company’s commercial real estate loan portfolio is located in this region. As the risks and circumstances of such loans in construction phase vary from that of non-construction commercial real estate loans, the Company assesses the allowance for credit losses separately for these two segments.
Home equity loans:
 The Company’s home equity loans and lines of credit are primarily originated by each of the bank subsidiaries in their local markets where there is a strong understanding of the underlying real estate value. The Company’s banks monitor and manage these loans, and conduct an automated review of all home equity lines of credit at least twice per year. This review collects FICO and Bankruptcy scores for each home equity borrower and identifies situations where the credit strength of the borrower is declining. When other specific events occur that may influence repayment, information such as tax liens or judgments is collected. The bank subsidiaries use this information to manage loans that may be higher risk and to determine whether to obtain additional credit information or updated property valuations. In a limited number of cases, the Company may issue home equity credit together with first mortgage financing, and requests for such financing are evaluated on a combined basis.
Residential real estate loans, including early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies:
 The Company’s residential real estate portfolio includes one- to four-family adjustable rate mortgages, construction loans to individuals and bridge financing loans for qualifying customers as well as certain long-term fixed rate loans. The Company’s residential mortgages relate to properties located principally in the Chicago metropolitan area, California, southern Wisconsin and west Michigan. Due to interest rate risk considerations, the Company generally sells in the secondary market loans originated with long-term fixed rates, for which we receive fee income. The Company also selectively retains certain of these loans within the banks’ own loan portfolios where they are non-agency conforming, or where the terms of the loans make them favorable to retain. Since this loan portfolio consists primarily of locally originated loans, and since the majority of the borrowers are longer-term customers with lower LTV ratios, the Company may face a relatively low risk of borrower default and delinquency. Collateral dependent residential real estate loans that are individually assessed when measuring the allowance for credit losses 
117
are primarily collateralized by such one-to-four family properties noted above. It is not the Company’s current practice to underwrite, and there are no plans to underwrite subprime, Alt A, no or little documentation loans, or option ARM loans.
Additionally, early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies include loans in which the Company is eligible or has exercised its option under the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”) securitization program to repurchase certain delinquent mortgage loans. Such loans were previously transferred by the Company with servicing of such loans retained. Early buy-out loans are insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) or the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, subject to indemnifications and insurance limits for certain loans. 
Premium finance receivables:
 The Company makes loans to finance insurance premiums related to property and casualty insurance policies. The loans are indirectly originated by working through independent medium and large insurance agents and brokers located throughout the United States and Canada. The insurance premiums financed are primarily for commercial customers’ purchases of liability, property and casualty and other commercial insurance. This lending involves relatively rapid turnover of the loan portfolio and high volume of loan originations. The Company performs ongoing credit and other reviews of the agents and brokers, and performs various internal audit steps to mitigate against the risk of fraud.
The Company also originates life insurance premium finance receivables. These loans are originated directly with the borrowers with assistance from life insurance carriers, independent insurance agents, financial advisors and legal counsel. The life insurance policy is the primary form of collateral. In addition, these loans often are secured with a letter of credit, marketable securities or certificates of deposit. In some cases, the Company may make a loan that has a partially unsecured position.
Consumer and other loans:
 Included in the consumer and other loan category is a wide variety of personal and consumer loans to individuals. The Company originates consumer loans in order to provide a wider range of financial services to its customers. Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than mortgage loans but generally involve more credit risk than mortgage loans due to the type and nature of the collateral.
U.S. government agency securities:
 This security type includes debt obligations of certain government-sponsored entities of the U.S. government such as the Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation and Fannie Mae. Such securities often contain an explicit or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government.
Municipal securities:
 The Company’s municipal securities portfolio includes bond issues for various municipal government entities located throughout the United States, including the Chicago metropolitan area, southern Wisconsin and west Michigan, some of which are privately placed and non-rated. Though the risk of loss is typically low, default history exists on municipal securities within the United States.
Mortgage-backed securities
: 
This security type includes debt obligations supported by pools of individual mortgage loans and issued by certain government-sponsored entities of the U.S. government such as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Such securities are considered to contain an implicit guarantee of the U.S. government.
Corporate notes
: 
The Company’s corporate notes portfolio includes bond issues for various public companies representing a diversified population of industries. The risk of loss in this portfolio is considered low based on the characteristics of the investments.
In accordance with ASC 326, the Company elected to not measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest. As such, accrued interest is written off in a timely manner when deemed uncollectible. Any such write-off of accrued interest will reverse previously recognized interest income. In addition, the Company elected to not include accrued interest within presentation and disclosures of the carrying amount of financial assets held at amortized cost. This election is applicable to the various disclosures included within the Company’s financial statements. Accrued interest related to financial assets held at amortized cost is included within

Credit Quality Indicators
Credit quality indicators, specifically the Company’s internal risk rating systems, reflect how the Company monitors credit losses and represents factors used by the Company when measuring the allowance for credit losses. The following discusses the Company’s credit quality indicators by financial asset.
119
Loan portfolios
The Company’s ability to manage credit risk depends in large part on its ability to properly identify and manage problem loans. To do so, the Company operates a credit risk rating system under which credit management personnel assign a credit risk rating (1 to 10 rating, with higher scores indicating higher risk) to each loan at the time of origination and review loans on a regular basis. For loans measured at amortized cost, these credit risk ratings are also an important aspect of the Company’s allowance for credit losses measurement methodology. The credit risk rating structure and classifications are shown below:
Pass (risk rating 1 to 5):
 Based on various factors (liquidity, leverage, etc.), the Company believes asset quality is acceptable and is deemed to not require additional monitoring by the Company.
Special mention (risk rating 6):
 Assets in this category are currently protected, potentially weak, but not to the point of substandard classification. Loss potential is moderate if corrective action is not taken.
Substandard accrual (risk rating 7):
 Assets in this category have well defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Loss potential is distinct but with no discernible impairment.
Substandard nonaccrual/doubtful (risk rating 8 and 9):
 Assets have all the weaknesses in those classified “substandard accrual” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current existing facts, conditions, and values, improbable.
Loss/fully charged-off (risk rating 10):
 Assets in this category are considered fully uncollectible. As such, these assets have no carrying balance on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Condition.
Early buy-out loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies
: These loans are measured at fair value and thus excluded from the measurement of the allowance for credit losses. Credit risk rating assigned to such loans are considered in the measurement of fair value as well as related guarantees provided by the FHA or the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, subject to indemnifications and insurance limits for certain loans.
Generally, each loan officer is responsible for monitoring his or her loan portfolio, recommending a credit risk rating for each loan in his or her portfolio and ensuring the credit risk ratings are appropriate. These credit risk ratings are then ratified by the bank’s chief credit officer and/or concurrence credit officer. Credit risk ratings are determined by evaluating a number of factors including: a borrower’s financial strength, cash flow coverage, collateral protection and guarantees.
The Company’s Problem Loan Reporting system includes all such loans described above with credit risk ratings of 6 through 9. This system is designed to provide an on-going detailed tracking mechanism for each problem loan. Once management determines that a loan has deteriorated to a point where it has a credit risk rating of 6 or worse, the Company’s Managed Asset Division performs an overall credit and collateral review. As part of this review, all underlying collateral is identified and the valuation methodology is analyzed and tracked. As a result of this initial review by the Company’s Managed Asset Division, the credit risk rating is reviewed and a portion of the outstanding loan balance may be deemed uncollectible and, as a result, no longer share similar risk characteristics as its related pool. If that is the case, the individual loan is considered collateral dependent and individually assessed for an allowance for credit loss. The Company’s individual assessment utilizes an independent re-appraisal of the collateral (unless such a third-party evaluation is not possible due to the unique nature of the collateral, such as a closely-held business or thinly traded securities). In the case of commercial real estate collateral, an independent third party appraisal is ordered by the Company’s Real Estate Services Group to determine if there has been any change in the underlying collateral value. These independent appraisals are reviewed by the Real Estate Services Group and sometimes by independent third party valuation experts and may be adjusted depending upon market conditions.
Through the credit risk rating process, such loans are reviewed to determine if they are performing in accordance with the original contractual terms. If the borrower has failed to comply with the original contractual terms, further action may be required by the Company, including a downgrade in the credit risk rating, movement to non-accrual status or a charge-off. If the Company determines that a loan amount or portion thereof is uncollectible, the loan’s credit risk rating is immediately downgraded to an 8 or 9 and the uncollectible amount is charged-off. Any loan that has a partial charge-off continues to be assigned a credit risk rating of an 8 or 9 for the duration of time that a balance remains outstanding. The Company undertakes a thorough and ongoing analysis to determine if additional impairment and/or charge-offs are appropriate and to begin a workout plan for the credit to minimize actual losses. In determining the appropriate charge-off for collateral-dependent loans, the Company considers the results of appraisals for the associated collateral.

Held-to-maturity debt securities
The Company conducts an assessment of its investment securities, including those classified as held-to-maturity, at the time of purchase and on at least an annual basis to ensure such investment securities remain within appropriate levels of risk and continue to perform satisfactorily in fulfilling its obligations. The Company considers, among other factors, the nature of the securities and credit ratings or financial condition of the issuer. If available, the Company obtains a credit rating for issuers from a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”) for consideration. If no such rating is available for an issuer, the Company performs an internal rating based on the scale utilized within the loan portfolio as discussed above. 
For purposes of the table below, the Company has converted any issuer rating from an NRSRO into the Company’s internal ratings based on Investment Policy and review by the Company’s management.

Measurement of Allowance for Credit Losses
The Company’s allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan losses, the allowance for unfunded commitment losses and the allowance for held-to-maturity debt security losses. In accordance with ASC 326, the Company measures the allowance for credit losses at the time of origination or purchase of a financial asset, representing an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses on the related asset. When developing its estimate, the Company considers available information relevant to assessing the collectability of cash flows, from both internal and external sources. Historical credit loss experience is one input in the estimation process as well as inputs relevant to current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. In considering past events, the Company considers the relevance, or lack thereof, of historical information due to changes in such things as financial asset underwriting or collection practices, and changes in portfolio mix due to changing business plans and strategies. In considering current conditions and forecasts, the Company considers both the current economic environment and the forecasted direction of the economic environment with emphasis on those factors deemed relevant to or driving changes in expected credit losses. 
As significant judgment is required, the review of the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is performed quarterly by various committees with participation by the Company’s executive management.

The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective or pooled basis when similar risk characteristics exist, based upon the segmentation discussed above. The Company utilizes modeling methodologies that estimate lifetime credit loss rates on each pool.  These methodologies include estimating the probability of default and loss given default on the commercial and commercial real estate segments, using the weighted-average remaining maturity methodology for the residential real estate, home equity, and consumer segments, and utilizing an assumption-based approach focusing on historical loss rates for the premium finance receivables segments. Historical credit loss history is adjusted for reasonable and supportable forecasts developed by the Company on a quantitative or qualitative basis and incorporates third party economic forecasts. Reasonable and supportable forecasts consider the macroeconomic factors that are most relevant to evaluating and predicting expected credit losses in the Company's financial assets. Currently, the Company utilizes an eight quarter forecast period using a single macroeconomic scenario provided by a third party and reviewed within the Company's governance structure. For periods beyond the ability to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts, the Company reverts to historical loss rates at an input level, straight-line over a four quarter reversion period. Expected credit losses are measured over the contractual term of the financial asset with consideration of expected prepayments. Expected extensions, renewals or modifications of the financial asset are considered when the expected extension, renewal or modification is contained within the existing agreement and is not unconditionally cancelable. The methodologies discussed above are applied to both current asset balances on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Condition and off-balance sheet commitments (i.e. unfunded lending-related commitments).
Assets that do not share similar risk characteristics with a pool are assessed for the allowance for credit losses on an individual basis. These typically include assets experiencing financial difficulties, including assets rated as substandard nonaccrual and doubtful. If foreclosure is probable or the asset is considered collateral-dependent, expected credit losses are measured based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral, adjusted for selling costs, if appropriate. Underlying collateral across the Company’s segments consist primarily of real estate, land and construction assets, as well as general business assets of the borrower. As of December 31, 2024, excluding loans carried at fair value, substandard nonaccrual loans totaling $
33.8
 million in carrying balance had no related allowance for credit losses. 
The Company does not measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable balances because these balances are written off in a timely manner as a reduction to interest income when assets are placed on nonaccrual status.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized an approximately $
100.9
 million provision for credit losses related to loans and lending agreements, including an approximately $
15.5
 million provision for credit losses related to non-PCD assets acquired with the Macatawa acquisition. 
The decreased provision compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily the result of improvements in the macroeconomic forecast, specifically the Company’s macroeconomic forecasts of key model inputs (most notably, Commercial Real Estate Price Index primarily impacting the commercial real estate portfolio and Baa corporate credit spreads) partially offset by growth experienced by the Company in 2024 in various loan portfolios and from the Macatawa acquisition. While uncertainties remain regarding expected economic performance, macroeconomic forecasts as of December 31, 2024 assume that the impact of those uncertainties is less severe compared to that assumed at December 31, 2023. 
Other key drivers of provision for credit losses in these portfolios include, but are not limited to, loan risk rating migration and net charge-offs in 2024 totaled $
94.4
 million.
124
Held-to-maturity debt securities
The allowance for credit losses on the Company’s held-to-maturity debt securities is presented as a reduction to the amortized cost basis of held-to-maturity securities on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Condition. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recognized approximately $
110,000
 and $(
141,000
), respectively, of provision for credit losses related to held-to-maturity securities. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not identify any held-to-maturity debt securities within its portfolio that would require a charge-off. 
Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulties 
The Company’s approach to restructuring or modifying loans is built on its credit risk rating system, which requires credit management personnel to assign a credit risk rating to each loan. In each case, the loan officer is responsible for recommending a credit risk rating for each loan and ensuring the credit risk ratings are appropriate. These credit risk ratings are then reviewed and approved by the bank’s chief credit officer and/or concurrence credit officer. Credit risk ratings are determined by evaluating a number of factors, including a borrower’s financial strength, cash flow coverage, collateral protection and guarantees. The Company’s credit risk rating scale is one through ten with higher scores indicating higher risk. In the case of loans rated six or worse following modification, the Company’s Managed Assets Division evaluates the loan and the credit risk rating and determines that the loan has been restructured to be reasonably assured of repayment and of performance according to the modified terms and is supported by a current, well-documented credit assessment of the borrower’s financial condition and prospects for repayment under the revised terms. Based on the Company’s credit risk rating system, it considers that borrowers whose credit risk rating is 5 or better are not experiencing financial difficulties.
Restructurings may arise when, due to financial difficulties experienced by the borrower, the Company obtains through physical possession one or more collateral assets in satisfaction of all or part of an existing credit. Once possession is obtained, the Company reclassifies the appropriate portion of the remaining balance of the credit from loans to other real estate owned (“OREO”), which is included within other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. For any residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, the Company is considered to possess the related collateral only if legal title is obtained upon completion of foreclosure, or the borrower conveys all interest in the residential real estate property to the Company through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or similar legal agreement. At December 31, 2024, the Company had 
no
 foreclosed residential real estate properties included within OREO. Further, the recorded investment in residential mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties for which foreclosure proceedings are in process totaled $
38.2
 million and $
53.3
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company recognizes MSR assets upon the sale of residential real estate loans to external third parties when it retains the obligation to service the loans and the servicing fee is more than adequate compensation. The initial recognition of MSR assets from loans sold with servicing retained and subsequent changes in fair value of all MSRs are recognized in 
mortgage banking revenue
. MSRs are subject to changes in value from actual and expected prepayment of the underlying loans. 
The estimation of fair value related to MSRs is partly impacted by the Company exercising its EBO on eligible loans previously sold to the GNMA. Under such optional repurchase program, financial institutions acting as servicers are allowed to buy back from the securitized loan pool individual delinquent mortgage loans meeting certain criteria for which the institution was the original transferor of such loans. At the option of the servicer and without prior authorization from GNMA, the servicer may repurchase such delinquent loans for an amount equal to the remaining principal balance of the loan. At the time of such repurchase, any MSR value related to such loans is derecognized.
The MSR asset fair value is determined by using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the objective characteristics of the portfolio as well as subjective valuation parameters that purchasers of servicing would apply to such portfolios sold into the secondary market. The subjective factors include loan prepayment speeds, discount rates, servicing costs and other economic factors. The Company uses a third party to assist in the valuation of MSRs.  
Periodically the Company will purchase options for the right to purchase securities not currently held within the banks’ investment portfolios or enter into interest rate swaps in which the Company elects to not designate such derivatives as hedging instruments. These option and swap transactions are designed primarily to economically hedge a portion of the fair value adjustments related to the Company’s MSRs. The gain or loss associated with these derivative contracts is included in mortgage 
127
banking revenue. For more information regarding these hedges outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, see Note (21) “Derivative Financial Instruments” in Item 8 of this report.

Business Combinations 
On August 1, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of Macatawa Bank Corporation (“Macatawa”), the parent company of Macatawa Bank. Pursuant to the terms of the merger, each common share of Macatawa outstanding at the time of merger was converted into the right to receive 
0.137
 shares of Wintrust common stock, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. As a result, the Company issued approximately 
4.7
 million shares of common stock, the fair value of consideration paid was $
499.3
 million. Macatawa operates 
26
 full-service branches located throughout communities in Kent, Ottawa and northern Allegan counties in the state of Michigan. Macatawa offers a full range of banking, retail and commercial lending, wealth management and ecommerce services to individuals, businesses and governmental entities. As of August 1, 2024, Macatawa had approximately $
2.7
 billion in assets, $
2.3
 billion in deposits and $
1.4
 billion in loans. In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company recorded $
53.7
 million discount on acquired loans, $
33.5
 million discount on securities and recorded total intangibles of $
253.0
 million. During 2024, the Company incurred $
4.3
 million in acquisition expenses related to the acquisition of Macatawa. The fair value estimates of the loans acquired are subject to adjustment up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition as additional information becomes available.
On April 3, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of Rothschild & Co Asset Management US Inc. and Rothschild & Co Risk Based Investments LLC from Rothschild & Co North America Inc. (collectively, “Rothschild & Co Asset Management  U.S.”). As of the acquisition date, the Company acquired approximately $
12.6
 million in net assets. As the transaction was determined to be a business combination, the Company recorded goodwill of approximately $
2.6
 million on the purchase.

The community banking unit’s goodwill increased $
142.1
 million in 2024 as a result of the Macatawa acquisition. The specialty finance segment’s goodwill decreased $
1.8
 million in 2024 as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments related to prior Canadian acquisitions.
The Company assesses each reporting unit’s goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis and considers potential indicators of impairment at each reporting date between annual goodwill impairment tests. At October 1, 2024, the Company utilized a quantitative approach for its annual goodwill impairment tests of the community banking, specialty finance and wealth management reporting units and determined that no impairment existed at that time. 
At each reporting date between annual goodwill impairment tests, the Company considers potential indicators of impairment. The Company assessed whether events and circumstances as of each reporting date in 2024 resulted in it being more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying value. Potential impairment indicators considered include the condition of the economy and banking industry; government intervention and regulatory updates; the impact of recent events to financial performance and cost factors of the reporting units; performance of the Company’s stock and other relevant events. As of December 31, 2024, the Company identified no indicators of goodwill impairment subsequent to its analysis as of October 1, 2024 within the community banking, specialty finance or wealth management reporting units and the Company determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of all reporting units exceeded the respective carrying value of such reporting unit.

 million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024 as a result of the Macatawa acquisition.
The core deposit intangibles recognized in connection with the Company’s bank acquisitions are amortized over a 
ten-year
 period on an accelerated basis. The customer list intangibles recognized in connection with the purchase of life insurance premium finance assets in 2009 are being amortized over an 
18-year
 period on an accelerated basis. The customer list and other intangibles recognized in connection with prior acquisitions within the wealth management segment are being amortized over a period of up to 
ten-years
 on a straight-line or accelerated basis. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of certain trade and domain names recognized in connection with prior acquisitions. As indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, the Company assesses impairment on at least an annual basis.
Total amortization expense associated with finite-lived intangibles in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $

$
3,151,309

$
2,326,071

FHLB advances consist of obligations of the banks and are collateralized by qualifying commercial and residential real estate and home equity loans and certain securities. The banks have arrangements with the FHLB whereby, based on available collateral, they could have borrowed an additional $
3.9
 billion at December 31, 2024.
FHLB advances are stated at par value of the debt adjusted for unamortized prepayment fees paid at the time of prior restructurings of FHLB advances and unamortized fair value adjustments recorded in connection with advances acquired through acquisitions and debt issuance costs. Unamortized prepayment fees are amortized as an adjustment to interest expense using the effective interest method. 
In 2024, the Company was required to repay approximately $
750.0
 million of FHLB advances prior to the respective maturity date as a result of call date terms within the related agreements. Approximately $
2.7
 billion of the FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2024 currently have varying put or call dates over the next 12 months. At December 31, 2024, the weighted average contractual interest rate on FHLB advances was

Subordinated Notes
At December 31, 2024, the Company had outstanding subordinated notes totaling $
298.3
 million compared to $
437.9
 million at December 31, 2023. In 2019, the Company issued $
300.0
 million of subordinated notes receiving $
296.7
 million in proceeds, 
131
net of underwriting discount. The notes have a stated interest rate of 
4.85
% and mature in June 2029. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company repaid the $
140.0
 million of subordinated notes issued in 2014. The notes had a stated interest rate of 
5.00
% and matured in June 2024. Subordinated notes are stated at par adjusted for unamortized issuance costs paid related to such debt.
In connection with the issuance of subordinated notes in 2019 and 2014, the Company incurred costs totaling $
3.3
 million and $
1.3
 million, respectively. These costs are a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the subordinated notes and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method. At December 31, 2024, the unamortized balances of costs for both issuances were approximately $
1.7
 million. These subordinated notes qualify as Tier II capital under the regulatory capital requirements, subject to restrictions.

Notes Payable
On December 12, 2022, the Company entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) with certain unaffiliated banks. The Credit Agreement consists of a $
200.0
 million term loan facility and a $
100.0
 million revolving credit facility. 
The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for, among other things, a maturity date for the revolving credit facility of December 5, 2025, and a maturity date for the term loan facility of December 12, 2027. The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also provides for certain financial covenants that must be met by the Company for so long as any amounts or commitments under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are still outstanding.
Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that are considered “Base Rate Loans” bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of (1) 
75
 basis points plus (2) the highest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 
50
 basis points, and (c) Term SOFR for a one-month tenor in effect on such day plus 
110
 basis points. Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that are considered “Term SOFR Loans” bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of (1) 
160
 basis points plus (2) Term SOFR for the applicable interested period. A commitment fee is payable quarterly in arrears in an amount equal to 
0.30
% of the actual daily amount by which the lenders’ commitments under the revolving credit facility exceeded the amount outstanding under such facility. The Company is required to make monthly or quarterly (as applicable) payments of interest in respect of all loans under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and quarterly payments of principal in respect of the loans under the term loan facility.
Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are secured by pledges of and first priority perfected security interests in the Company’s equity interest in its bank subsidiaries and contain several restrictive covenants, including the maintenance of various capital adequacy levels, asset quality and profitability ratios, and certain restrictions on dividends and other indebtedness.  As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The term loan facility and revolving credit facility under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are available to be utilized, as needed, to provide capital to fund continued growth at the Company’s banks and to serve as an interim source of funds for acquisitions, common stock repurchases or other general corporate purposes.  
The term debt facility is stated at par of the current outstanding balance of the debt adjusted for unamortized costs paid by the Company in relation to the debt issuance. Unamortized costs paid by the Company in relation to the issuance of the revolving credit facility are classified in other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. 
As of December 31, 2024, the outstanding principal balance under the term loan facility was $
142.8
 million and there was 
no
 outstanding principal balance under the revolving credit facility.
132
Short-term Borrowings
Short-term borrowings include securities sold under repurchase agreements of customer sweep accounts in connection with master repurchase agreements at the banks. At December 31, 2024, the Company had 
none
 of these types of borrowings compared to $
13.4
 million at December 31, 2023. The Company records securities sold under repurchase agreements at their gross value and does not offset positions on the Consolidated Statements of Condition.
Secured Borrowings
Secured borrowings primarily represent transactions to sell an undivided co-ownership interest in all receivables owed to the Company’s subsidiary, First Insurance Funding of Canada (“FIFC Canada”). In December 2014, FIFC Canada sold such interest to an unrelated third party in exchange for a cash payment of approximately C$
150
 million pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement (“Receivables Purchase Agreement”). Amendments to the Receivables Purchase Agreement since issuance increased the total payments to C$
650
 million, extended the maturity date to December 15, 2025. Additionally, since Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (“CDOR”) ceased being used in Canada in June 2024, references to CDOR changed to the Benchmark rate. These transactions were not considered sales of receivables and, as such, related proceeds received are reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Condition as a secured borrowing owed to the unrelated third party, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, and translated to the Company’s reporting currency as of the respective date. At December 31, 2024, the translated balance of the secured borrowing totaled $
323.2
 million compared to $
392.5
 million at December 31, 2023.  The interest rate under the Receivables Purchase Agreement is the Canadian Commercial Paper Rate plus 
0.825
%.
Other Borrowings
Other borrowings represent a fixed-rate promissory note (“Fixed-Rate Promissory Note”) issued by the Company in June 2017. Amendments to the Fixed-Rate Promissory Note since issuance increased the principal amount to $
66.4
 million, reduced the interest rate to 
1.70
% and extended the maturity date to March 31, 2025. The Fixed-Rate Promissory Note relates to and is secured by 
three
 office buildings owned by the Company. At December 31, 2024, the Fixed-Rate Promissory Note had a balance of $
57.1
 million compared to $
59.2
 million at December 31, 2023. Under the Fixed-Rate Promissory Note, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, the Company made monthly principal and interest payments. The Fixed-Rate Promissory Note contains several restrictive covenants, including the maintenance of various capital adequacy levels, asset quality and profitability ratios, and certain restrictions on dividends and indebtedness. At December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.  
The remaining $
11.7
 million within secured borrowings at December 31, 2024 represents other sold interests in certain loans by the Company that were not considered sales and, as such, related proceeds received are reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Condition as a secured borrowing owed to the various unrelated third parties.

Junior Subordinated Debentures
As of December 31, 2024, the Company owned 
100
% of the common securities of 
eleven
 trusts, Wintrust Capital Trust III, Wintrust Statutory Trust IV, Wintrust Statutory Trust V, Wintrust Capital Trust VII, Wintrust Capital Trust VIII, Wintrust Capital Trust IX, Northview Capital Trust I, Town Bankshares Capital Trust I, First Northwest Capital Trust I, Suburban Illinois Capital Trust II, and Community Financial Shares Statutory Trust II (the “Trusts”) set up to provide long-term financing. The Northview, Town, First Northwest, Suburban and Community Financial Shares capital trusts were acquired as part of the acquisitions of Northview Financial Corporation, Town Bankshares, Ltd., First Northwest Bancorp, Inc., Suburban Illinois Bancorp, Inc. and Community Financial Shares, Inc., respectively. The Trusts were formed for purposes of issuing trust preferred securities to third-party investors and investing the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities and common securities solely in junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company (or assumed by the Company in connection with an acquisition), with the same maturities and interest rates as the trust preferred securities. The junior subordinated debentures are the sole assets of the Trusts. In each Trust, the common securities represent approximately 
3
% of the junior subordinated debentures and the trust preferred securities represent approximately 
97
% of the junior subordinated debentures.
The Trusts are reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as unconsolidated subsidiaries. Accordingly, in the Consolidated Statements of Condition, the junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company to the Trusts are reported as liabilities and the common securities of the Trusts, all of which are owned by the Company, are included in investment securities.

The following table provides a summary of the Company’s junior subordinated debentures as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The junior subordinated debentures represent the par value of the obligations owed to the Trusts.

The interest rates on the variable rate junior subordinated debentures are based on the three-month Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”) Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) and reset on a quarterly basis.
At December 31, 2024, the weighted average contractual interest rate on the junior subordinated debentures was 
6.85
%. Distributions on the common and preferred securities issued by the Trusts are payable quarterly at a rate per annum equal to the interest rates being earned by the Trusts on the junior subordinated debentures. Interest expense on the junior subordinated debentures is deductible for income tax purposes.
Under AIRLA and Part 253 of Regulation ZZ (Rule 253), after June 30, 2023, the interest rate on the junior subordinated debentures, by operation of law, changed their base rate from USD LIBOR to CME Term SOFR of the same tenor, plus an applicable tenor spread adjustment. CME Term SOFR  is  an  indicative,  forward-looking  measurement  of  daily  overnight  SOFR. CME Term SOFR is published by CME Group Inc., as administrator of that rate. The calculation agent for any series of the junior subordinated debentures may also make additional administrative conforming changes to the terms of that series of the junior subordinated debentures under AIRLA and Rule 253.
The Company has guaranteed the payment of distributions and payments upon liquidation or redemption of the trust preferred securities, in each case to the extent of funds held by the Trusts. The Company and the Trusts believe that, taken together, the obligations of the Company under the guarantees, the junior subordinated debentures, and other related agreements provide, in the aggregate, a full, irrevocable and unconditional guarantee, on a subordinated basis, of all of the obligations of the Trusts under the trust preferred securities. Subject to certain limitations, the Company has the right to defer the payment of interest on the junior subordinated debentures at any time, or from time to time, for a period not to exceed 20 consecutive quarters. The trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption, in whole or in part, upon repayment of the junior subordinated debentures at maturity or their earlier redemption. The junior subordinated debentures are redeemable in whole or in part prior to maturity at any time after the earliest redemption dates shown in the table, and earlier at the discretion of the Company if certain conditions are met, and, in any event, only after the Company has obtained Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) approval, if then required under applicable guidelines or regulations.
At December 31, 2024, the Company included $
245.5
 million of the junior subordinated debentures, net of common securities, in Tier 2 regulatory capital.

Wealth Management Revenue
Wealth management revenue is comprised of brokerage and insurance product commissions, managed money fees and trust and asset management revenue of the Company's 
four
 wealth management subsidiaries: Wintrust Investments, GLA, WPT and CDEC. All wealth management revenue is recognized in the wealth management segment. 
Brokerage and insurance product commissions consists primarily of commissions earned from trade execution services on behalf of customers and from selling mutual funds, insurance and other investment products to customers. For trade execution services, the Company recognizes commissions and receives payment from the brokerage customers at the point of transaction execution. Commissions received from the investment or insurance product providers are recognized at the point of sale of the product. The Company also receives trail and other commissions from providers for certain plans. These are generally based on qualifying account values and are recognized once the performance obligation, specific to each provider, is satisfied on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. 
Trust revenue is earned primarily from trust and custody services that are generally performed over time as well as fees earned on funds held during the facilitation of tax-deferred like-kind exchange transactions. Revenue is determined periodically based on a schedule of fees applied to the value of each customer account using a time-elapsed method to measure progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. Fees are typically billed on a calendar month or quarter basis in advance or in arrears depending upon the contract. Upfront fees received related to the facilitation of tax-deferred like-kind exchange transactions are deferred until the transaction is completed. Additional fees earned for certain extraordinary services performed on behalf of the customers are recognized when the service has been performed.

Asset management revenue is earned from money management and advisory services that are performed over time. Revenue is based primarily on the market value of assets under management or administration using a time-elapsed method to measure progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. Fees are typically billed on a calendar month or quarter basis in advance or in arrears depending upon the contract. Certain programs provide the customer with an option of paying fees as a percentage of the account value or incurring commission charges for each trade similar to brokerage and insurance product commissions. Trade commissions and any other fees received for additional services are recognized at a point in time once the performance obligation is satisfied. 
135
Mortgage Broker Fees
For customers desiring a mortgage product not currently offered by the Company, the Company may refer such customers and, with permission, direct such customers' applications to certain third party mortgage brokers. Mortgage broker fees are received from these brokers for such customer referrals upon settlement of the underlying mortgage. The Company's entitlement to the consideration is contingent on the settlement of the mortgage which is highly susceptible to factors outside of the Company's influence, such as the third party broker's underwriting requirements. Also, the uncertainty surrounding the consideration could be resolved in varying lengths of time, dependent upon the third party brokers. Therefore, mortgage broker fees are recognized at the settlement of the underlying mortgage when the consideration is received. Broker fees are recognized in the community banking segment. 
Service Charges on Deposit Accounts
Service charges on deposit accounts include fees charged to deposit customers for various services, including account analysis services, and are based on factors such as the size and type of customer, type of product and number of transactions. The fees are based on a standard schedule of fees and, depending on the nature of the service performed, the service is performed at a point in time or over a period of a month. When the service is performed at a point in time, the Company recognizes and receives revenue when the service has been performed. When the service is performed over a period of a month, the Company recognizes and receives revenue in the month the service has been performed. Service charges on deposit accounts are recognized in the community banking segment. 
Administrative Services
Administrative services revenue is earned from providing outsourced administrative services, such as data processing of payrolls, billing and cash management services, to temporary staffing service clients located throughout the United States. Fees are charged periodically (typically a payroll cycle) and computed in accordance with the contractually determined rate applied to the total gross billings administered for the period. The revenue is recognized over the period using a time-elapsed method to measure progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation. Other fees are charged on a per occurrence basis as the service is provided in the billing cycle. The Company has certain contracts with customers to perform outsourced administrative services and short-term accounts receivable financing. For these contracts, the total fee is allocated between the administrative services revenue and interest income during the client onboarding process based on the specific client and services provided. Administrative services revenue is recognized in the specialty finance segment. 
Card and Deposit Related Fees
Card related fees include interchange and merchant revenue, and fees related to debit and credit cards. Interchange revenue is related to the Company issued debit cards. Other deposit related fees primarily include pay by phone processing fees, ATM and safe deposit box fees, check order charges and foreign currency related fees. Card and deposit related fees are generally based on volume of transactions and are recognized at the point in time when the service has been performed. For any consideration that is constrained, the revenue is recognized once the uncertainty is known. Upfront fees received from certain contracts are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract. Card and deposit related fees are recognized in the community banking segment.

Contract liabilities represent upfront fees that the Company received at inception of certain contracts. The revenue recognized that was included in the contract liability balance at beginning of the period totaled $
565,000
 and $
932,000
 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Receivables are recognized in the period the Company provides services when the Company's right to consideration is unconditional. Card related fee receivable is the result of volume based fee that the Company receives from a customer on an annual basis in the second quarter of each year. Payment terms on other invoiced amounts are typically 30 days or less. Contract liabilities and receivables from contracts with customers are included within the accrued interest payable and other liabilities and accrued interest receivable and other assets line items, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. 
Transaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations
For contracts with an original expected length of more than one year, the following table presents the estimated future timing of recognition of upfront fees related to card and deposit related fees.

Practical Expedients and Exemptions
The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the Company expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the Company transfers a promised service to a customer and when the customer pays for that services is one year or less. 
The Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have recognized is one year or less.

Management has determined that a valuation allowance is not required for the deferred tax assets at December 31, 2024 because it is more likely than not that these assets could be realized through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and future taxable income. This conclusion is based on the Company’s historical earnings, its current level of earnings and prospects for continued growth and profitability.
140
The Company has Federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of $
2.6
 million that begin to expire in 2029 through 2035 and are subject to IRC Section 382 annual limitation. The NOL carryforwards were a result of acquisitions.
The Company accounts for uncertainties in income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” At December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company had 
no
 unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. If the Company were to record interest or penalties associated with uncertain tax positions, the interest or penalties would be included in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2024, the Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase in the next 12 months.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax in numerous state jurisdictions and in Canada. In the ordinary course of business, we are routinely subject to audit by the taxing authorities of these jurisdictions. Currently, the Company’s U.S. federal income tax returns are open and subject to audit for the 2021 tax return year forward, and in general, the Company’s state income tax returns are open and subject to audit from the 2021 tax return year forward, subject to individual state statutes of limitation. The Company has extended the statute of limitations on certain state income tax returns for tax years 2017 through 2020 due to an ongoing audit. The Company’s Canadian subsidiary’s Canadian income tax returns are also subject to audit for the 2021 tax return year forward.

Stock Compensation Plans and Other Employee Benefit Plans 
Stock Incentive Plan
In May 2022, the Company’s shareholders approved the 2022 Stock Incentive Plan (“the 2022 Plan”) which provides for the issuance of up to 
1,200,000
 shares of common stock plus any shares of common stock that were available for awards under the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (“the 2015 Plan”) as of the effective date of the 2022 Plan. The 2022 Plan replaced the 2015 Plan, and similarly, the 2015 Plan replaced the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (“the 2007 Plan”) and the 2007 Plan replaced the 1997 Stock Incentive Plan (“the 1997 Plan”). The 2022 Plan, 2015 Plan, 2007 Plan and the 1997 Plan are collectively referred to as “the Plans.” The 2022 Plan has substantially similar terms to the predecessor plans. Awards granted under the Plans for which common shares are not issued by reason of cancellation, forfeiture, lapse of such award or settlement of such award in cash, are again available under the 2022 Plan. All grants made after the approval of the 2022 Plan are made pursuant to the 2022 Plan. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 
680,538
 shares were available for future grants assuming the maximum number of shares are issued for the performance awards outstanding. The Plans cover substantially all employees of Wintrust. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors administers all stock-based compensation programs and authorizes all awards granted pursuant to the Plans. 
The Plans permit the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, restricted share or unit awards, performance awards and other incentive awards valued in whole or in part by reference to the Company’s common stock, all on a stand-alone, combination or tandem basis. The Company historically awarded stock-based compensation in the form of time-vested non-qualified stock options and time-vested restricted share unit awards (“restricted shares”). The grants of options provide for the purchase of shares of the Company’s common stock at the fair market value of the stock on the date the options are granted. Stock options generally vest ratably over periods of 
three
 to 
five years
 and have a maximum term of 
ten years
 from the date of grant. Restricted shares entitle the holders to receive, at no cost, shares of the Company’s common stock. Restricted shares generally vest over periods of 
one
 to 
five years
 from the date of grant.
Beginning in 2011, the Company has awarded annual grants under the Long-Term Incentive Program (“LTIP”), which is administered under the Plans. The LTIP is designed in part to align the interests of management with interests of shareholders, foster retention, create a long-term focus based on sustainable results and provide participants a target long-term incentive opportunity. LTIP grants in 2024, 2023, and 2022 consisted of a combination of performance-based stock awards with a performance condition metric, performance-based stock awards with a market condition metric and time-vested restricted shares. Performance-based stock awards granted under the LTIP are contingent upon the achievement of pre-established long-term performance goals set in advance by the Compensation Committee over a 
three-year
 period starting at the beginning of each calendar year. Performance-based stock awards with a market condition metric are contingent on the total shareholder return performance over a 
three-year
 period relative to the KBW Regional Bank Index. These performance awards are granted at a target level, and based on the Company’s achievement of the pre-established long-term goals, the actual payouts can range from 
0
% to a maximum of 
150
% of the target award. The awards typically vest in the quarter after the end of the performance period upon certification of the payout by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. Holders of performance-based stock awards are entitled to receive, at no cost, the shares earned based on the achievement of the pre-established long-term goals.
141
Holders of restricted share awards and performance-based stock awards received under the Plans are not entitled to vote or receive cash dividends (or cash payments equal to the cash dividends) on the underlying common shares until the awards are vested and shares are issued. Shares that are vested but are not issuable pursuant to deferred compensation arrangements accrue additional shares based on the value of dividends otherwise paid. Except in limited circumstances, awards granted pursuant to the Plans are canceled upon termination of employment without any payment of consideration by the Company.
Stock-based compensation is measured as the fair value of an award on the date of grant, and the measured cost is recognized over the period which the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the award. The fair value of restricted share and performance-based stock awards with a performance metric is determined based on the average of the high and low trading prices on the grant date. The fair value of performance stock awards with a market condition metric is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model and the fair value of stock options is estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Monte Carlo simulation model and the Black-Scholes option-pricing model require the input of highly subjective assumptions and are sensitive to changes in the award’s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock, which can materially affect the fair value estimates. Management periodically reviews and adjusts the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of such awards when granted. 
No
 options have been granted since 2016.
Stock-based compensation is recognized based on the number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest, taking into account expected forfeitures. In addition, for performance-based awards with a performance metric, an estimate is made of the number of shares expected to vest as a result of actual performance against the performance criteria in the award to determine the amount of compensation expense to recognize. The estimate is re-evaluated quarterly and total compensation expense is adjusted for any change in estimate in the current period. 
Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $
38.9
 million, $
33.5
 million and $
31.7
 million and the related tax benefits were $
8.3
 million, $
7.4
 million and $
7.0
 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pretax intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the Company’s stock price at year end and the option exercise price, multiplied by the number of shares) that would have been received by the option holders if they had exercised their options on the last day of the year. Options with exercise prices above the year end stock price are excluded from the calculation of intrinsic value. The intrinsic value will change based on the fair market value of the Company’s stock.

At December 31, 2024, the maximum number of performance-based shares that could be issued on outstanding awards if performance is attained at the maximum amount was approximately 
670,000
 shares.
The actual tax benefit realized upon the vesting and issuance of restricted shares and performance-based stock is based on the fair value of the shares on the issue date, and the estimated tax benefit of the awards is based on fair value of the awards on the grant date. The actual tax benefit realized upon the vesting and issuance of restricted shares and performance-based stock in 2024 was $
4.4
 million more than the expected tax benefit for those shares; in 2023 the actual tax benefit was $
1.8
 million more than the expected tax benefit for those shares and in 2022 the actual tax benefit was $
580,000
 more than the expected tax benefit for those shares. These differences in actual and expected tax benefits were recorded to income tax expense.
As of December 31, 2024, there was $
47.2
 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share based arrangements under the Plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 
two years
. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $
34.7
 million, $
22.1
 million and $
4.5
 million, respectively.
The Company issues new shares to satisfy its obligation to issue shares granted pursuant to the Plans.
Cash Incentive and Retention Plan
The Cash Incentive and Retention Plan (“CIRP”) allows the Company to provide cash compensation to the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ officers and employees. The CIRP is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The CIRP generally provides for the grants of cash awards, which may be earned pursuant to the achievement of performance criteria established by the Compensation Committee and/or continued employment. The performance criteria, if any, established by the Compensation Committee must relate to one or more of the criteria specified in the CIRP, which includes: earnings, earnings growth, revenues, stock price, return on assets, return on equity, improvement of financial ratings, achievement of balance sheet or income statement objectives and expenses. These criteria may relate to the Company, a particular line of business or a specific subsidiary of the Company. The Company had 
no
 expense related to the CIRP in 2024, 2023 and 2022, and 
no
 awards were paid in those years. There were 
no
 outstanding awards under this plan at December 31, 2024. 
143
Other Employee Benefits
Wintrust and its subsidiaries also provide 401(k) Retirement Savings Plans (“401(k) Plans”). The 401(k) Plans cover all employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. Contributions by employees are made through salary deferrals at their direction, subject to certain Plan and statutory limitations. Employer contributions to the 401(k) Plans are made at the employer’s discretion. Eligible participants that have contributed to the 401(k) Plans are eligible to share in an allocation of employer contributions. The Company’s expense for the employer contributions to the 401(k) Plans was approximately $
19.7
 million in 2024, $
19.2
 million in 2023, and $
16.2
 million in 2022.
The Wintrust Financial Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) is designed to encourage greater stock ownership among employees, thereby enhancing employee commitment to the Company. The ESPP gives eligible employees the right to accumulate funds over an offering period to purchase shares of common stock. All shares offered under the ESPP will be either newly issued shares of the Company or shares issued from treasury, if any. In accordance with the ESPP, beginning January 1, 2015, the purchase price of the shares of common stock is equal to 
95
% of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the last day of the offering period. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, 
32,942
, 
46,034
 and 
40,421
, shares of common stock, respectively, were purchased by participants and 
no
 compensation expense was recorded. The Company plans to continue to offer common stock through this ESPP on an ongoing basis and, in 2021, increased the shares authorized under the ESPP by 
200,000
 shares. At December 31, 2024, the Company had an obligation to issue 
6,540
 shares of common stock to participants and had 
133,496
 shares available for future grants under the ESPP.
The Company does not currently offer other postretirement benefits such as health care or other pension plans.
Directors Deferred Fee and Stock Plan
The Wintrust Financial Corporation Directors Deferred Fee and Stock Plan (“DDFS Plan”) allows directors of the Company and its subsidiaries to choose to receive payment of directors’ fees in either cash or common stock of the Company and to defer the receipt of the fees. The DDFS Plan is designed to encourage stock ownership by directors. All shares offered under the DDFS Plan will be either newly issued shares of the Company or shares issued from treasury. The number of shares issued is determined on a quarterly basis based on the fees earned during the quarter and the fair market value per share of the common stock on the last trading day of the preceding quarter. The shares are issued annually and the directors are entitled to dividends and voting rights upon the issuance of the shares. During 2020, an additional 
200,000
 shares were authorized under the DDFS Plan. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, a total of 
14,927
 shares, 
63,001
 shares and 
59,174
 shares, respectively, were issued to directors. For those directors that elect to defer the receipt of the common stock, the Company maintains records of stock units representing an obligation to issue shares of common stock. The number of stock units equals the number of shares that would have been issued had the director not elected to defer receipt of the shares. Additional stock units are credited at the time dividends are paid, however no voting rights are associated with the stock units. The shares of common stock represented by the stock units are issued in the year specified by the directors in their participation agreements. At December 31, 2024, the Company has an obligation to issue 
304,092
 shares of common stock to directors and has 
52,508
 shares available for future grants under the DDFS Plan.

Regulatory Matters
Banking laws place restrictions upon the amount of dividends that can be paid to Wintrust by the banks. Based on these laws, the banks could, subject to minimum capital requirements, declare dividends to Wintrust without obtaining regulatory approval in an amount not exceeding (a) undivided profits, and (b) the amount of net income reduced by dividends paid for the current and prior two years. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, cash dividends totaling $
475.0
 million, $
360.0
 million and $
52.0
 million, respectively, were paid to Wintrust by the banks and other subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2024, the banks had approximately $
932.5
 million available to be paid as dividends to Wintrust without prior regulatory approval and without reducing their capital below the well-capitalized level.
The Company and the banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements established by the federal banking agencies that take into account risk attributable to balance sheet and off-balance sheet activities. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory — and possibly discretionary — actions by regulators, that if undertaken could have a direct material effect on the Company’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the banks must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company’s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. 
144
Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the banks to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined) and Tier 1 leverage capital (as defined) to average quarterly assets (as defined). The Federal Reserve’s capital guidelines require bank holding companies to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk-weighted assets of 
8.0
%, of which at least 
4.50
% must be in the form of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and 
6.0
% must be in the form of Tier 1 capital. The Federal Reserve also requires a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total assets of 
4.0
%. In addition, the Federal Reserve continues to consider the Tier 1 leverage ratio in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities. 
As reflected in the following table, the Company met all minimum capital requirements at December 31, 2024 and 2023:

Wintrust is designated as a financial holding company. Bank holding companies approved as financial holding companies may engage in an expanded range of activities, including the businesses conducted by its wealth management subsidiaries. As a financial holding company, Wintrust’s banks are required to maintain their capital positions at the “well-capitalized” level. As of December 31, 2024, the banks were categorized as well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. The ratios required for the banks to be “well capitalized” by regulatory definition are 
10.0
%, 
8.0
%, 
6.5
% and 
5.0
% for total capital to risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets and Tier 1 leverage ratio, respectively.

NA - Macatawa Bank acquired August 1, 2024
Wintrust’s mortgage banking division and broker/dealer subsidiary are also required to maintain minimum net worth capital requirements with various governmental agencies. The mortgage banking division’s net worth requirements are governed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the broker/dealer’s net worth requirements are governed by the SEC. As of December 31, 2024, these business units met their minimum net worth capital requirements.
(20) 
Commitments and Contingencies
The Company has outstanding, at any time, a number of commitments to extend credit. These commitments include revolving home equity line and other credit agreements, term loan commitments and standby and commercial letters of credit. Standby and commercial letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Standby letters of credit are contingent upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of the underlying contract with the third party, while commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate commerce and typically result in the commitment being drawn on when the underlying transaction is consummated between the customer and the third party.
These commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. Commitments to extend commercial, commercial real estate and construction loans totaled $
11.5
 billion and $
10.5
 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and unused home equity lines totaled $
999.1
 million and $
845.6
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Standby and commercial letters of credit totaled $
503.4
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
389.5
 million at December 31, 2023.
In addition, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had approximately $
361.3
 million and $
222.8
 million, respectively, in commitments to fund residential mortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market. These lending commitments are also considered derivative instruments. The Company also enters into forward contracts for the future delivery of residential mortgage loans at specified interest rates to reduce the interest rate risk associated with commitments to fund loans as well as mortgage loans held-for-sale. These forward contracts are also considered derivative instruments and had contractual amounts of approximately $
377.5
 million at December 31, 2024 and $
626.9
 million at December 31, 2023. See Note (21) “Derivative Financial Instruments” in Item 8 of this report for further discussion on derivative instruments.
The Company enters into residential mortgage loan sale agreements with investors in the normal course of business. These agreements usually require certain representations concerning credit information, loan documentation, collateral and insurability. On occasion, investors have requested the Company to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to 
147
repurchase loans which the investors believe do not comply with applicable representations. Management maintains a liability for estimated losses on loans expected to be repurchased or on which indemnification is expected to be provided and regularly evaluates the adequacy of this recourse liability based on trends in repurchase and indemnification requests, actual loss experience, known and inherent risks in the loans, and current economic conditions. The Company sold approximately $
2.6
 billion of mortgage loans in 2024 and $
2.0
 billion in 2023. The liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification claims for residential mortgage loans previously sold to investors was approximately $
188,000
 and $
152,000
 at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition. Losses charged against the liability were $
60,100
 in 2024 as compared to $
96,000
 in 2023. These losses relate to mortgages which experienced early payment and other defaults meeting certain representation and warranty recourse requirements.
The Company had unfunded commitments to investment partnerships that qualify for CRA purposes totaling $
94.1
 million and $
54.0
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of these commitments, $
67.0
 million and $
36.2
 million related to legally-binding unfunded commitments for tax-credit investments and were included within other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The Company utilizes an out-sourced securities clearing platform and has agreed to indemnify the clearing broker of Wintrust Investments for losses that it may sustain from the customer accounts introduced by Wintrust Investments. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total amount of customer balances maintained by the clearing broker and subject to indemnification was approximately $
15.4
 million and $
9.0
 million, respectively. Wintrust Investments seeks to control the risks associated with its customers’ activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral in compliance with various regulatory and internal guidelines.
Litigation Matters
In accordance with applicable accounting principles, the Company establishes an accrued liability for litigation and threatened litigation actions and proceedings when those actions present loss contingencies, which are both probable and estimable. In actions for which a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, the Company determines whether it can estimate a loss or range of possible loss. To determine whether a possible loss is estimable, the Company reviews and evaluates its material litigation on an ongoing basis, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. This review may include information learned through the discovery process, rulings on substantive or dispositive motions, and settlement discussions.
Wintrust Mortgage California PAGA Matter
On May 24, 2022, a former Wintrust Mortgage employee filed a California Private Attorney General Act (“PAGA”) suit, not individually, but as representative of all Wintrust Mortgage’s California hourly employees, against Wintrust Mortgage in the Superior Court of San Diego County, California. Plaintiff alleges Wintrust Mortgage failed to provide: (i) accurate sick leave accrual and pay; (ii) overtime wages; (iii) accurately itemized wage statements; (iv) meal breaks and meal premiums; (v) timely payment of earned wages; (vi) payment of all earned wages; and (vii) payment of all vested vacation hours. Wintrust Mortgage disputes the validity of Plaintiff’s claims and believes, to the extent there were defects in complying with California law governing the payment of compensation to Plaintiff, such errors would have been de minimis. Plaintiff also has an arbitration agreement with a collective and class action waiver and on January 19, 2023, Wintrust Mortgage moved to compel arbitration. The court stayed litigation pending mediation, which was held on May 13, 2024.  The parties agreed to settle the dispute for an immaterial amount.  On October 16, 2024, the court entered an order approving the settlement and on December 31, 2024, the funds were disbursed to the settlement administrator.
Wintrust Mortgage Fair Lending Matter
On May 25, 2022, a Wintrust Mortgage customer filed a putative class action and asserted individual claims against Wintrust Mortgage and Wintrust Financial Corporation in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  Plaintiff alleges that Wintrust Mortgage discriminated against black/African American borrowers and brings class claims under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Sections 1981 and 1982 under Chapter 42 of the United States Code; and the Fair Housing Act of 1968.  Plaintiff also asserts individual claims under theories of promissory estoppel, fraudulent inducement, and breach of contract. On September 23, 2022, Wintrust filed a motion to dismiss the entire suit and the court granted that motion to dismiss on September 27, 2023 and gave Plaintiff until October 20, 2023 to file an amended complaint. Plaintiff timely filed an amended complaint. Wintrust moved to dismiss the amended complaint on November 21, 2023. This motion was fully briefed in January 2024 and remains pending with the Court. Wintrust vigorously disputes these allegations, believing them to be legally and factually meritless, and Wintrust otherwise lacks sufficient information to estimate the amount of any potential liability.
148
Wintrust Financial ERISA Matter
On July 29, 2022, a former Wintrust employee filed a class action in the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois asserting claims under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) against Wintrust Financial Corporation. Plaintiff alleges Wintrust breached its fiduciary duty in the selection of BlackRock Target Date funds for inclusion in its 401(k) plan, that Wintrust failed to monitor the performance of those funds, and in the alternative, Wintrust should be liable for breach of trust. Plaintiff’s sole basis for the allegations is that BlackRock Target Date funds allegedly performed more poorly than two comparable funds over a three-year period. Wintrust is one of several public companies that were sued on identical grounds within the same week by the same plaintiff’s law firm. On November 8, 2022, Wintrust filed a motion to dismiss the entire complaint. On July 14, 2023, the District Court granted Wintrust’s motion to dismiss and gave Plaintiff until August 2, 2023 to file an amended complaint. Plaintiff timely filed an amended complaint which Wintrust moved to dismiss on September 14, 2023. On August 14, 2024, the district court granted Wintrust’s motion with prejudice. On September 9, 2024, Plaintiff timely appealed to the Seventh Circuit. In December 2024, Plaintiff proposed the parties agree to dismiss the appeal and on December 18, 2024, the court entered and approved the joint stipulation of dismissal with prejudice which ended the litigation.
Other Matters
In addition, the Company and its subsidiaries, from time to time, are subject to pending and threatened legal action and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business.
Based on information currently available and upon consultation with counsel, management believes that the eventual outcome of any pending or threatened legal actions and proceedings described above, including our ordinary course litigation, will not have a material adverse effect on the operations or financial condition of the Company. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations or financial condition for a particular period.
(21) 
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company primarily enters into derivative financial instruments as part of its strategy to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates. Derivative instruments represent contracts between parties that result in one party delivering cash to the other party based on a notional amount and an underlying term (such as a rate, security price or price index or commodity price) as specified in the contract. The amount of cash delivered from one party to the other is determined based on the interaction of the notional amount of the contract with the underlying term. Derivatives are also implicit in certain contracts and commitments.
The derivative financial instruments currently used by the Company to manage its exposure to interest rate risk include: (1) interest rate swaps and collars to manage the interest rate risk of certain fixed and variable rate assets and variable rate liabilities; (2) interest rate lock commitments provided to customers to fund certain mortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market; (3) forward commitments for the future delivery of such mortgage loans to protect the Company from adverse changes in interest rates and corresponding changes in the value of mortgage loans held-for-sale; (4) covered call options to economically hedge specific investment securities and receive fee income, effectively enhancing the overall yield on such securities to compensate for net interest margin compression; and (5) options and swaps to economically hedge a portion of the fair value adjustments related to the Company’s mortgage servicing rights portfolio. The Company also enters into derivatives (typically interest rate swaps and commodity forward contracts) with certain qualified borrowers to facilitate the borrowers’ risk management strategies and concurrently enters into mirror-image derivatives with a third party counterparty, effectively making a market in the derivatives for such borrowers. Additionally, the Company enters into foreign currency contracts to manage foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency denominated assets.
The Company recognizes derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding the instrument. The Company records derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition within accrued interest receivable and other assets and accrued interest payable and other liabilities, respectively. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in income or in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss depending on whether the derivative financial instrument qualifies for hedge accounting and, if so, whether it qualifies as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge. 
Changes in fair values of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges are recorded in income in the same period and in the same income statement line as changes in the fair values of the hedged items that relate to the hedged risk(s). Changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of deferred taxes, and reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. Changes in fair values of derivative financial instruments not designated in a hedging relationship pursuant to ASC 815 are 
149
reported in non-interest income during the period of the change. Derivative financial instruments are valued by a third party and are corroborated by comparison with valuations provided by the respective counterparties. Fair values of certain mortgage banking derivatives (interest rate lock commitments and forward commitments to sell mortgage loans) are estimated based on changes in mortgage interest rates from the date of the loan commitment. The fair value of foreign currency derivatives is computed based on changes in foreign currency rates stated in the contract compared to those prevailing at the measurement date. Commodity derivative fair values are computed based on changes in the price per unit stated in the contract compared to those prevailing at the measurement date.

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk
The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to net interest income and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps and interest rate collars as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts to or from a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving or paying fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount. Interest rate collars designated as cash flow hedges involve the settlement of amounts in which the interest rate specified in the contract exceeds the agreed upon cap strike rate or in which the interest rate specified in the contract is below the agreed upon floor strike rate at the end of each period.  
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had various interest rate collar and swap derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate loans. When the relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument is highly effective at achieving offsetting changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and are subsequently reclassified to interest income as interest payments are made on such variable rate loans. The changes in fair value (net of tax) are separately disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

In the first quarter of 2022, the Company terminated interest rate swap derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate deposits with a total notional value of $
1.0
 billion and a 
five-year
 term effective July 2022. At the time of termination, the fair value of the derivative contracts totaled an asset of $
66.5
 million, with such adjustments to fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. In the second quarter of 2022, the Company terminated 
two
 interest rate swap derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate deposits with a total notional value of $
500.0
 million each effective since April 2020. The remaining terms of such derivative contracts were through March 2023 and April 2024 and, at the time of termination, the fair value of the derivative contracts totaled assets of $
3.7
 million and $
10.7
 million, respectively, with such adjustments to fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company terminated 
one
 additional interest rate collar derivative contract designated as a cash flow hedge of the Term Facility with a total notional value of $
64.3
 million effective since September 2018. The remaining term of such derivative contract was through September 2023 and, at the time of termination, the fair value of the derivative contract totaled an asset of $
875,000
, with such adjustments to fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. 
For all such terminations, as the hedged forecasted transactions (interest payments on variable rate deposits and the Term Facility) are still expected to occur over the remaining term of such terminated derivatives, such adjustments will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and be reclassified as a reduction to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the original term of the terminated derivative contracts.

Fair Value Hedges of Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges involve the payment of fixed amounts to a counterparty in exchange for the Company receiving variable payments over the life of the agreements without the exchange of the underlying notional amount.  As of December 31, 2024, the Company had 
13
 interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $
176.2
 million that were designated as fair value hedges primarily associated with fixed rate commercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans as well as life insurance premium finance receivables.
For derivatives designated and that qualify as fair value hedges, the net gain or loss from the entire change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recognized in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect, including the net gain or loss, of the hedged item (interest income earned on fixed rate loans) when the hedged item affects earnings.
The following table presents the carrying amount of the hedged assets/(liabilities) and the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the hedged assets/(liabilities) that are designated as a fair value hedge accounting relationship as of December 31, 2024:

Non-Designated Hedges
The Company does not use derivatives for speculative purposes. Derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are used to manage the Company’s economic exposure to interest rate movements and other identified risks but do not meet the strict 
152
hedge accounting requirements of ASC 815. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded directly in earnings. 
Interest Rate Derivatives
—Periodically, the Company may purchase interest rate cap derivatives designed to act as an economic hedge of the risk of the negative impact on its fixed-rate loan portfolios from rising interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, there were 
no
 interest rate caps outstanding that were designed to act as an economic hedge. 
Additionally, the Company has interest rate derivatives, including swaps and option products, resulting from a service the Company provides to certain qualified borrowers. The Company’s banking subsidiaries execute certain derivative products (typically interest rate swaps) directly with qualified commercial borrowers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. For example, these arrangements allow the Company’s commercial borrowers to effectively convert a variable rate loan to a fixed rate. In order to minimize the Company’s exposure on these transactions, the Company simultaneously executes offsetting derivatives with third parties. In most cases, the offsetting derivatives have mirror-image terms, which result in the positions’ changes in fair value substantially offsetting through earnings each period. However, to the extent that the derivatives are not a mirror-image and because of differences in counterparty credit risk, changes in fair value will not completely offset resulting in some earnings impact each period. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in other non-interest income. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had interest rate derivative transactions with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $
13.3
 billion and $
11.4
 billion, respectively, (all interest rate swaps and caps with customers and third parties) related to this program. At December 31, 2024, these interest rate derivatives had maturity dates ranging from January 2025 to January 2037.
Mortgage Banking Derivatives—
These derivatives include interest rate lock commitments provided to customers to fund certain mortgage loans to be sold into the secondary market and forward commitments for the future delivery of such loans. It is the Company’s practice to enter into forward commitments for the future delivery of a portion of our residential mortgage loan production when interest rate lock commitments are entered into in order to economically hedge the effect of future changes in interest rates on its commitments to fund the loans as well as on its portfolio of mortgage loans held-for-sale. The Company’s mortgage banking derivatives have not been designated as being in hedge relationships. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had interest rate lock commitments with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $
120.7
 million and $
129.9
 million and forward commitments to sell mortgage loans with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $
377.5
 million and $
626.9
 million. The fair values of these derivatives were estimated based on changes in mortgage rates from the dates of the commitments. Changes in the fair value of these mortgage banking derivatives are included in mortgage banking revenue.
Commodity Derivatives—
The Company has commodity forward contracts resulting from a service the Company provides to certain qualified borrowers. The Company’s banking subsidiaries execute certain derivative products directly with qualified commercial borrowers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. For example, these arrangements allow the Company’s commercial borrowers to effectively purchase or sell a given commodity at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. In order to minimize the Company’s exposure on these transactions, the Company simultaneously executes offsetting derivatives with third parties. In most cases, the offsetting derivatives have mirror-image terms, which result in the positions’ changes in fair value substantially offsetting through earnings each period. However, to the extent that the derivatives are not a mirror-image and because of differences in counterparty credit risk, changes in fair value will not completely offset resulting in some earnings impact each period. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in other non-interest income. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had commodity derivative transactions with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $
5.2
 million and $
8.4
 million, respectively, (all forward contracts with customers and third parties) related to this program. At December 31, 2024, these commodity derivatives had maturity dates ranging from January 2025 to October 2025. 
Foreign Currency Derivatives—
The Company has foreign currency derivative contracts resulting from a service the Company provides to certain qualified customers. The Company’s banking subsidiaries execute certain derivative products directly with qualified customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies related to foreign currency fluctuations. For example, these arrangements allow the Company’s customers to effectively exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. In order to minimize the Company’s exposure on these transactions, the Company simultaneously executes offsetting derivatives with third parties. In most cases, the offsetting derivatives have mirror-image terms, which result in the positions’ changes in fair value substantially offsetting through earnings each period. However, to the extent that the derivatives are not a mirror-image and because of differences in counterparty credit risk, changes in fair value will not completely offset resulting in some earnings impact each period. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in other non-interest income. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company held foreign currency derivatives with an aggregate notional amount of approximately $
97.1
 million and $
144.3
 million, respectively. 
153
Other Derivatives—
Periodically, the Company will sell options to a bank or dealer for the right to purchase certain securities held within the banks’ investment portfolios (covered call options). These option transactions are designed to increase the total return associated with the investment securities portfolio. These options do not qualify as accounting hedges pursuant to ASC 815 and, accordingly, changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized as other non-interest income. There were 
no
 covered call options outstanding as of December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023.
Periodically, the Company will purchase options for the right to purchase securities not currently held within the banks’ investment portfolios or enter into interest rate swaps in which the Company elects to not designate such derivatives as hedging instruments. These option and swap transactions are designed primarily to economically hedge a portion of the fair value adjustments related to the Company’s mortgage servicing rights portfolio. The gain or loss associated with these derivative contracts are included in mortgage banking revenue.  At December 31, 2024 the Company held 
ten
 interest rate derivatives with an aggregate notional value of $
295.0
 million and 
four
 interest rate derivatives with an aggregate notional value of $
195.0
 million at December 31, 2023 for such purpose of economically hedging a portion of the fair value adjustment related to its mortgage servicing rights portfolio.

Credit Risk
Derivative instruments have inherent risks, primarily market risk and credit risk. Market risk is associated with changes in the value of an underlying asset. Credit risk relates to the risk that the counterparty will fail to perform according to the terms of the agreement. The Company is exposed to the credit risk of its commercial borrowers and third party financial institutions who are counterparties to interest rate derivatives with the Company.
The counterparty credit risk associated with the mirror-image swaps executed with third party financial institutions, is monitored and managed as part of the Company’s overall asset-liability management process, except that the counterparty credit risk related to derivatives entered into with certain qualified borrowers is managed through the Company’s standard loan underwriting process for commercial borrowers since these derivatives typically share in the collateral provided by the loan agreements. 
When deemed necessary, appropriate types and amounts of collateral are obtained to minimize credit exposure. The Company hedges the market risk of derivatives transactions with commercial borrowers by entering into offsetting transactions with large, highly rated financial institutions. These exposures are generally secured by cash under bilateral Credit Support Annexes (“CSAs”), which are a component of the ISDA Master Agreements executed with counterparties. 
Aggregate counterparty exposures are monitored against various types of credit limits established to contain risk within parameters. Counterparty credit risk is managed by the Counterparty Credit Risk Management team in accordance with SR 11-10, 
Interagency Counterparty Credit Risk Guidance
, which was issued in 2011 in response to the financial crisis of 2008. The guidance addresses counterparty credit risk governance, measurement, management, and systems. Specifically, counterparty risk is managed through the establishment and regular review of exposure limits, formalization of limits in policy and procedure, ongoing review of models, and having a single platform to allow for the timely aggregation of exposures. The Counterparty Credit Risk Management team uses a variety of approaches to monitor counterparty financial performance, including monitoring of credit exposure versus limits, use of early warning reports, and daily and intraday monitoring of financial developments.
The Company has agreements with certain of its interest rate derivative counterparties that contain cross-default provisions, which provide that if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. The 
154
Company also has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision allowing the counterparty to terminate the derivative positions if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well or adequately capitalized institution, which would require the Company to settle its obligations under the agreements. If the Company were to breach any of these provisions, at a time when the derivatives subject to such agreements are in a liability position, and the derivatives were to be terminated as a result, the Company would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value and would be required to pay any additional amounts due in excess of amounts previously posted as collateral with the respective counterparty. As of December 31, 2024, there were 
no
 derivatives that were subject to such agreements in a net liability position. 
The Company records interest rate derivatives subject to master netting agreements at their gross value and does not offset derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Condition.

Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities 
The Company measures, monitors and discloses certain of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. These financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the observability of the inputs used to determine fair value. These levels are:
•
Level 1 — unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•
Level 2 — inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
•
Level 3 — significant unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.
A financial instrument’s categorization within the above valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the assets or liabilities. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
Available-for-sale debt securities, trading account securities and equity securities with readily determinable fair value 
— Fair values for available-for-sale debt securities, trading account securities and equity securities with readily determinable fair value are typically based on prices obtained from independent pricing vendors. Securities measured with these valuation techniques are generally classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Typically, standard inputs such as benchmark yields, reported trades for similar securities, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including market research publications are used to determine the fair value these securities. When these inputs are not available, broker/dealer quotes may be obtained by the vendor to determine the fair value of the security. We review the vendor’s pricing methodologies to determine if observable market information is being used, versus unobservable inputs. Fair value measurements using 
155
significant inputs that are unobservable in the market due to limited activity or a less liquid market are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of U.S. Treasury securities and certain equity securities with readily determinable fair value are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical securities. As such, these securities are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
The Company’s Investment Operations Department is responsible for the valuation of Level 3 available-for-sale debt securities. The methodology and variables used as inputs in pricing Level 3 securities are derived from a combination of observable and unobservable inputs. The unobservable inputs are determined through internal assumptions that may vary from period to period due to external factors, such as market movement and credit rating adjustments.
At December 31, 2024, the Company classified $
121.6
 million of municipal securities as Level 3. These municipal securities are bond issues for various municipal government entities primarily located in the Chicago metropolitan area and southern Wisconsin and are privately placed, non-rated bonds without CUSIP numbers. The Company’s methodology for pricing these securities focuses on three distinct inputs: equivalent rating, yield and other pricing terms. To determine the rating for a given non-rated investment debt security, the Investment Operations Department references a rated, publicly issued bond by the same issuer if available. A reduction is then applied to the rating obtained from the comparable bond, as the Company believes if liquidated, a non-rated bond would be valued less than a similar bond with a verifiable rating. The reduction applied by the Company is one complete rating grade (i.e., a “AA” rating for a comparable bond would be reduced to “A” for the Company’s valuation). For bond issues without comparable bond proxies, a rating of “BBB” was assigned. For the year ended December 31, 2024, all of the ratings derived by the Investment Operations Department using the above process were “BBB” or better. The fair value measurement noted above is sensitive to the rating input, as a higher rating typically results in an increased valuation. The remaining pricing inputs used in the bond valuation are observable. Based on the rating determined in the above process, Investment Operations obtains a corresponding current market yield curve available to market participants. Other terms including coupon, maturity date, redemption price, number of coupon payments per year, and accrual method are obtained from the individual bond term sheets. Certain municipal bonds held by the Company at December 31, 2024 are continuously callable. When valuing these bonds, the fair value is capped at par value as the Company assumes a market participant would not pay more than par for a continuously callable bond. 
Mortgage loans held-for-sale 
— The fair value of mortgage loans held-for-sale is typically determined by reference to investor price sheets for loan products with similar characteristics. Loans measured with this valuation technique are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
At December 31, 2024, the Company classified $
60.4
 million of certain delinquent mortgage loans held-for-sale as Level 3. For such delinquent loans in which investor interest may be limited, the Company estimates fair value by discounting future scheduled cash flows for the specific loan through its life, adjusted for estimated credit losses. The Company uses a discount rate based on prevailing market coupon rates on loans with similar characteristics. The assumed weighted average discount rate used as an input to value these loans at December 31, 2024 was 
6.61
%. The higher the rate utilized to discount estimated future cash flows, the lower the fair value measurement. Additionally, the weighted average credit discount used as an input to value the specific loans was 
0.69
% with a credit loss discount ranging from 
0
% to 
20
% at December 31, 2024.
Loans held-for-investment 
— The fair value of loans held-for-investment is typically determined by reference to investor price sheets for loan products with similar characteristics. Loans measured with this valuation technique are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
The fair value for certain loans in which the Company previously elected the fair value option is estimated by discounting future scheduled cash flows for the specific loan through maturity, adjusted for estimated credit losses and prepayment or life assumptions. These loans primarily consist of early buyout loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are delinquent and, as a result, investor interest may be limited. The Company uses a discount rate based on the actual coupon rate of the underlying loan. At December 31, 2024, the Company classified $
34.9
 million of loans held-for-investment carried at fair value as Level 3. The assumed weighted average discount rate used as an input to value these loans at December 31, 2024 was 
6.61
%. The higher the rate utilized to discount estimated future cash flows, the lower the fair value measurement. As noted above, the fair value estimate also includes assumptions of prepayment speeds and average life as well as credit losses. The weighted average prepayments speed used as an input to value current loans was 
8.29
% at December 31, 2024. Prepayment speeds are inversely related to the fair value of these loans as an increase in prepayment speeds results in a decreased valuation. For delinquent loans in which performance is not assumed and there is a higher probability of resolution of the loan ending in foreclosure, the weighted average life of such loans was 
6.1
 years. Average life is inversely related to the fair value of these loans as an increase in estimated life results in a decreased valuation. Additionally, the weighted average credit discount used as an input to value the specific loans was 
1.17
% with credit loss discounts ranging from 
0
% to 
39
% at December 31, 2024. 
156
MSRs 
— Fair value for MSRs is determined utilizing a valuation model which calculates the fair value of each servicing right based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The Company uses a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with each servicing right, given current market conditions. At December 31, 2024, the Company classified $
203.8
 million of MSRs as Level 3. The weighted average discount rate used as an input to value the pool of MSRs at December 31, 2024 was 
10.95
% with discount rates applied ranging from 
6
% to 
18
%. The higher the rate utilized to discount estimated future cash flows, the lower the fair value measurement. The fair value of MSRs was also estimated based on other assumptions including prepayment speeds and the cost to service. Prepayment speeds ranged from 
4
% to 
90
% or a weighted average prepayment speed of 
8.29
%. Further, for current and delinquent loans, the Company assumed a weighted average cost of servicing of $
76
 and $
378
, respectively, per loan. Prepayment speeds and the cost to service are both inversely related to the fair value of MSRs as an increase in prepayment speeds or the cost to service results in a decreased valuation. See Note (6) “Mortgage Servicing Rights (“MSRs”)” for further discussion of MSRs.  
Derivative instruments 
— The Company’s derivative instruments include interest rate swaps, caps and collars, commitments to fund mortgages for sale into the secondary market (interest rate locks), forward commitments to end investors for the sale of mortgage loans, commodity future contracts and foreign currency contracts. Interest rate swaps, caps and collars and commodity future contracts are valued by a third party, using models that primarily use market observable inputs, such as yield curves and commodity prices prevailing at the measurement date, and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The credit risk associated with derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements is measured on a net basis by counterparty portfolio. The fair value for mortgage-related derivatives is based on changes in mortgage rates from the date of the commitments. The fair value of foreign currency derivatives is computed based on change in foreign currency rates stated in the contract compared to those prevailing at the measurement date.
At December 31, 2024, the Company classified $
2.0
 million of derivative assets related to interest rate locks as Level 3. The fair value of interest rate locks is based on prices obtained for loans with similar characteristics from third parties, adjusted for the pull-through rate, which represents the Company’s best estimate of the likelihood that a committed loan will ultimately fund.  The weighted-average pull-through rate at December 31, 2024 was 
82.52
% with pull-through rates applied ranging from 
1
% to 
100
%. Pull-through rates are directly related to the fair value of interest rate locks as an increase in the pull-through rate results in an increased valuation.
Nonqualified deferred compensation assets 
— The underlying assets relating to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan are included in a trust and primarily consist of non-exchange traded institutional funds which are priced based by an independent third party service. These assets are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

The aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 for mortgage loans held- for-sale measured at fair value under ASC 825 was $
335.9
 million and $
291.7
 million, respectively, while the aggregate fair value of mortgage loans held-for-sale was $
331.3
 million and $
292.7
 million, respectively, as shown in the above tables. At December 31, 2024, $
4.0
 million of mortgage loans held-for-sale were classified as nonaccrual compared to $
649,000
 as of December 31, 2023. Additionally, there were $
59.3
 million of loans past due greater than 90 days and still accruing interest within the mortgage loans held-for-sale portfolio as of December 31, 2024 compared to $
26.6
 million as of December 31, 2023. All of the nonaccrual loans and loans past due greater than 90 days and still accruing within the mortgage loans held-for-sale portfolio as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were individual delinquent mortgage loans bought back from GNMA at the unconditional option of the Company as servicer for those loans.

Changes in the balance of mortgage loans held-for-sale, MSRs and derivative assets related to fair value adjustments are recorded as components of mortgage banking revenue.  Changes in the balance of loans held-for-investment related to fair value adjustments are recorded as other non-interest income.
Also, the Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain other assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis in accordance with GAAP. These adjustments to fair value usually result from impairment charges on individual assets. 
For assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis that were still held in the balance sheet at the end of the period, the following table provides the carrying value of the related individual assets or portfolios at December 31, 2024.

Net fair value losses recognized on other real estate owned include valuation adjustments and charge-offs during the respective period.
Individually assessed loans 
— In accordance with ASC 326, the allowance for credit losses for loans and other financial assets held at amortized cost should be measured on a collective or pooled basis when such assets exhibit similar risk characteristics. In instances in which a financial asset does not exhibit similar risk characteristics to a pool, the Company is required to measure such allowance for credit losses on an individual asset basis. For the Company’s loan portfolio, nonaccrual loans are considered 
159
to not exhibit similar risk characteristics as pools and thus are individually assessed. Credit losses are measured by estimating the fair value of the loan based on the present value of expected cash flows, the market price of the loan, or the fair value of the underlying collateral. Individually assessed loans are considered a fair value measurement where an allowance for credit loss is established based on the fair value of collateral. Appraised values on relevant real estate properties, which may require adjustments to market-based valuation inputs, are generally used on foreclosure probable and collateral-dependent loans within the real estate portfolios.
The Company’s Managed Assets Division is primarily responsible for the valuation of Level 3 inputs of individually assessed loans. For more information on individually assessed loans refer to Note (5) “Allowance for Credit Losses”. At December 31, 2024, the Company had $
119.3
 million of individually assessed loans classified as Level 3. All of the $
119.3
 million of individually assessed loans were measured at fair value based on the underlying collateral of the loan as shown in the table above. 
None
 were valued based on discounted cash flows in accordance with ASC 310,”Receivables.”
Other real estate owned 
— Other real estate owned is comprised of real estate acquired in partial or full satisfaction of loans and is included in other assets. Other real estate owned is recorded at its estimated fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of transfer, with any excess of the related loan balance over the fair value less expected selling costs charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent changes in value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount and are recorded in other non-interest expense. Gains and losses upon sale, if any, are also charged to other non-interest expense. Fair value is generally based on third party appraisals and internal estimates that are adjusted by a discount representing the estimated cost of sale and is therefore considered a Level 3 valuation.
The Company’s Managed Assets Division is primarily responsible for the valuation of Level 3 inputs for other real estate owned. At December 31, 2024, the Company had $
23.1
 million of other real estate owned classified as Level 3. The unobservable input applied to other real estate owned relates to the 
10
% reduction to the appraisal value representing the estimated cost of sale of the foreclosed property. A higher discount for the estimated cost of sale results in a decreased carrying value.

Not all the financial instruments listed in the table above are subject to the disclosure provisions of ASC 820, as certain assets and liabilities result in their carrying value approximating fair value. These include cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing deposits with banks, brokerage customer receivables, FHLB and FRB stock, accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable and non-maturity deposits.
The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair values of financial instruments that were not previously disclosed.
Held-to-maturity securities 
—

Held-to-maturity securities include U.S. government-sponsored agency securities, municipal bonds issued by various municipal government entities primarily located in the Chicago metropolitan area, southern Wisconsin, and west Michigan and mortgage-backed securities. Fair values for held-to-maturity securities are typically based on prices obtained from independent pricing vendors. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has generally categorized these held-to-maturity securities as a Level 2 fair value measurement. Fair values for certain other held-to-maturity securities are based on the bond pricing methodology discussed previously related to certain available-for-sale securities. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized these held-to-maturity securities as a Level 3 fair value measurement. 
Loans held-for-investment, at amortized cost 
— Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are analyzed by type (commercial, residential real estate, etc.) and category within each type (construction, non-construction, franchise lending etc.). Each category is further segmented by interest rate type (fixed and variable). The fair value of both fixed and variable rate loans is estimated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the 
162
estimated maturity using estimated market discount rates that reflect credit and interest rate risks inherent in the loan. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized loans as a Level 3 fair value measurement.
Deposits with stated maturities 
— The fair value of certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently in effect for deposits of similar remaining maturities. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized deposits with stated maturities as a Level 3 fair value measurement.
FHLB advances 
— The fair value of FHLB advances is calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market rates of similar maturity debt securities to discount cash flows. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized FHLB advances as a Level 3 fair value measurement.
Subordinated notes 
—

The fair value of the subordinated notes is based on a market price obtained from an independent pricing vendor. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized subordinated notes as a Level 2 fair value measurement.
Junior subordinated debentures 
— The fair value of the junior subordinated debentures is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. In accordance with ASC 820, the Company has categorized junior subordinated debentures as a Level 3 fair value measurement.

Segment Information 
The Company’s operations consist of 
three
 primary segments: community banking, specialty finance and wealth management.
The 
three
 reportable segments are strategic business units that are separately managed as they offer different products and services and have different marketing strategies. In addition, each segment’s customer base has varying characteristics and each segment has a different regulatory environment. While the Company’s management monitors each of the 
sixteen
 bank subsidiaries’ operations and profitability separately, these subsidiaries have been aggregated into 
one
 reportable operating segment due to the similarities in products and services, customer base, operations, profitability measures and economic characteristics.
For purposes of internal segment profitability, management allocates certain intersegment and parent company balances. Management allocates a portion of revenues to the specialty finance segment related to loans and leases originated by the specialty finance segment and sold or assigned to the community banking segment. Similarly, for purposes of analyzing the contribution from the wealth management segment, management allocates a portion of the net interest income earned by the community banking segment on deposit balances of customers of the wealth management segment to the wealth management segment. See Note 
(10) “Deposits”
 for more information on these deposits. Finally, expenses incurred at the Wintrust parent company are allocated to each segment based on each segment’s risk-weighted assets.  
The segment financial information provided in the following tables has been derived from the internal profitability reporting system used by management to monitor and manage the financial performance of the Company. The accounting policies of the segments are substantially similar to those described in Note (1) “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”. 
Our Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). The CODM uses income before taxes to review segment performance and allocate resources for each reportable segment. Financial information regarding each significant segment expense outlined below is regularly provided (at least monthly) to the CODM. For community banking and specialty finance segments, ‘Interest expense’ is a significant segment expense. Additionally, for each of the 
three
 reportable segments, ‘Salaries’, ‘Commissions and incentive compensation’ and ‘Benefits’ are significant segment expenses.

Potentially dilutive common shares can result from stock options, restricted stock unit awards and shares to be issued under the ESPP and the DDFS Plan, being treated as if they had been either exercised or issued, computed by application of the treasury stock method. While potentially dilutive common shares are typically included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from this computation in periods in which the effect would reduce the loss per share or increase the income per share.

ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
The Company made no changes in and had no disagreements with its independent accountants during the two most recent fiscal years or any subsequent interim period.
ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
As of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based upon, and as of the date of that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in ensuring the information relating to the Company (and its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner. As permitted by SEC-issued guidance that an assessment of internal controls over financial reporting of a recently acquired business may be excluded from management’s evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures for up to a year from the date of acquisition, the Company excluded Macatawa from management’s reporting on internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 as Macatawa was acquired by the Company during 2024. The Company will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as it completes the integration of Macatawa with the Company and will make changes to its internal control framework, as necessary. The acquisition of Macatawa contributed $3.3 billion of assets, or 5.1% of the Company’s total assets, at December 31, 2024 and $63.6 million of net revenue, or 2.6% of the Company’s total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024. The annual report of the Company’s management on internal control over financial reporting is provided on page 170. The report of Ernst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, regarding the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is provided on page 171.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Report on Management’s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Wintrust Financial Corporation is responsible for the preparation, integrity, and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The consolidated financial statements and notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and necessarily include some amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments. 
We, as management of Wintrust Financial Corporation, are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting that is designed to produce reliable financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The system of internal control over financial reporting as it relates to the financial statements is evaluated for effectiveness by management and tested for reliability through a program of internal audits. Actions are taken to correct potential deficiencies as they are identified. Any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. 
Management assessed the Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, in relation to criteria for the effective internal control over financial reporting as described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (COSO Criteria). Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company's system of internal control over financial reporting is effective and meets the criteria of the COSO Criteria. 
In conducting the evaluation of the effectiveness of its system of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, the Company excluded the operations of Macatawa Bank, N.A. (“Macatawa”) as permitted by the guidance issued by the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission (not to extend more than one year beyond the date of the acquisition or for more than one annual reporting period). The acquisition of Macatawa was completed on August 1, 2024.  As of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, Macatawa’s assets represented approximately $3.3 billion of assets, or 5.1% of the Company’s total assets, at December 31, 2024 and $63.6 million of net revenue, or 2.6% of the Company’s total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024.  Refer to Note (7) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the acquisition and its impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 
Ernst & Young LLP (PCAOB ID 
42
), the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company's financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting. Their report expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Wintrust Financial Corporation 
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Wintrust Financial Corporation and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Wintrust Financial Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
As indicated in the accompanying Report on Management’s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Macatawa Bank, N.A. (“Macatawa”), which is included in the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 5.1% of total assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2024 and 2.6% of total net revenue, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Macatawa.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statements of condition of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. 
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report on Management’s Assessment of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
