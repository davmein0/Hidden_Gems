and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report. For discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for Fiscal Year 2023 as compared to Fiscal Year 2022, please refer to Part II, Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on December 6, 2023. Any forward-looking statements made by or on our behalf are made pursuant to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Readers are cautioned that such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and the actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. For a description of the risks and uncertainties, please see “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Executive Overview
We develop, design, manufacture and service custom-engineered equipment and systems that distribute, control and monitor the flow of electrical energy and provide protection to motors, transformers and other electrically powered equipment. We are headquartered in Houston, Texas and primarily serve the oil and gas and petrochemical markets, the electric utility market, and commercial and other industrial markets. Beyond these major markets, we also provide products and services to the light rail traction power market and other markets that include universities and government entities. We are continuously developing new channels to electrical markets through original equipment manufacturers and distribution market channels. For additional information on the markets we serve, see “Markets” in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report.
In Fiscal 2024, we reported revenues of $1.0 billion, net income of $149.8 million, and generated $108.7 million in cash from operating activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had total assets of $928.2 million.
Outlook
Our backlog was $1.3 billion as of September 30, 2024, of which approximately $849 million is expected to be recognized as revenue during our fiscal year ending September 30, 2025. Although current commercial activity remains active in most of the markets that we compete in, we remain attentive to the macro environment and geopolitical events that may have an impact on future market activity.

Oil and gas and petrochemical markets.
 Our order activity remains strong in these markets. The North American market is responding to increased international demand for LNG and gas-to-chemical processes utilizing low-cost gas feedstocks. We believe the fundamentals of the U.S. natural gas market, through abundant supply and low cost, will continue to support investments in LNG, related gas processing, and petrochemical processes, and as a result, will continue to sustain our order activity associated with such markets. In addition to the traditional crude oil refining and other oil and gas downstream processes, we have recently expanded our end markets into hydrogen production, carbon capture as well as alternative fuels, such as biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel, in response to the demand for clean energy.  
Electric utility market.
 Aligned with our strategy of end-market diversification, we seek to continue our focus and growth in electrical distribution substations, while also addressing a resurgence of power generation investment in this market.
Commercial and other industrial markets.
 We have experienced strong growth in these end markets driven by a mix of factors including increased investment in commercial and light industrial facilities for the production of various goods, the expansion of data centers and cloud computing, as well as the growing demand in industrial applications to support new technologies driving the energy transition. We are cautiously optimistic regarding the anticipated investment across AI applications that may drive data center growth and subsequently power generation demand. 
25
Business Environment
The markets in which we participate are capital-intensive and cyclical in nature. Cyclicality is predominantly driven by customer demand, global economic and geopolitical conditions and anticipated environmental, safety or regulatory changes that affect the manner in which our customers proceed with capital investments. Our customers analyze various factors, including the demand and price for oil, gas and electrical energy, the overall economic and financial environment, governmental budgets, regulatory actions and environmental concerns. These factors influence the release of new capital projects by our customers, which are traditionally awarded in competitive bid situations. Scheduling of projects is matched to customer requirements, and projects typically take a number of months to produce. Schedules may change during the course of any particular project, and our operating results can, therefore, be impacted by factors outside of our control.
Our operating results are impacted by several factors such as the timing of new order awards, project backlog, changes in project cost estimates, customer approval of final engineering specifications and delays in customer construction schedules, all of which contribute to short-term earnings variability and the timing of project execution. Our operating results also have been, and may continue to be, impacted by the timing and resolution of change orders and the resolution of potential contract claims and liquidated damages, all of which could improve or deteriorate gross margins during the period in which these items are resolved with our customers. Disruptions in the global supply chain have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our business and operating results due to the limited supply of, delays for and uncertainty in the timing of the receipt of key component parts and commodities. We continue to remain focused on the variables that impact our markets as well as cost management, labor availability and supply chain challenges. 
We are subject to inflation, which can cause increases in our costs of labor, indirect expenses and raw materials, primarily copper, aluminum and steel. Fixed-price contracts can limit our ability to pass these increases to our customers, thus negatively impacting our earnings and operations in future periods.
During Fiscal 2024, we experienced commodity price volatility, in addition to the ongoing supply chain delays for specific engineered components that have been persistent. We are working closely with our suppliers to meet our customer commitments. In response to the increased cost environment and supply chain challenges, we strive to effectively manage our product pricing, delivery schedules and bid validity dates with our customers, as well as improve factory efficiencies and project execution, and as a result our gross margins have been improved in Fiscal 2024.
Results of Operations
Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2023 
Revenue and Gross Profit 
Revenues and costs are primarily related to custom engineered-to-order equipment and systems and are accounted for under percentage-of-completion accounting, which precludes us from providing detailed price and volume information. 
Revenues increased by 45%, or $313.0 million, to $1.0 billion in Fiscal 2024, primarily driven by the increase in project backlog resulting from large contracts awarded during Fiscal 2023 and strong bookings throughout Fiscal 2024. Domestic revenues increased by 52%, or $288.6 million, to $846.5 million in Fiscal 2024. International revenues increased by 17%, or $24.5 million, to $165.8 million in Fiscal 2024. Our international revenues include both revenues generated from our international facilities as well as revenues from export projects generated at our domestic facilities. 
In Fiscal 2024, revenue from our core oil and gas market (excluding petrochemical) increased by 53%, or $144.1 million, to $417.2 million in Fiscal 2024; petrochemical market revenue increased by 97%, or $91.4 million, to $185.6 million; revenue from our electric utility market increased by 18%, or $28.1 million, to $186.5 million; commercial and other industrial market revenue increased by 44%, or $45.9 million, to $149.9 million; and revenue from all other markets combined increased by 23%, or $9.6 million to $51.1 million. These increases in revenue were driven by improved market conditions in most of our end markets, increased capital spending in our core oil, gas and petrochemical markets, as well as our strategic effort to expand our business into electric utility and commercial and other industrial markets. Revenue from our light rail traction power market decreased by 22%, or $6.1 million, to $22.0 million in Fiscal 2024 due to less project volume in this market. For additional information on the markets we serve, see “Markets” in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report.
26
Gross profit increased by 85%, or $125.5 million, to $273.1 million in Fiscal 2024. Gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to 27% in Fiscal 2024 as compared to 21% in Fiscal 2023. This increase in gross profit is attributable to the higher volume levels across all of Powell's manufacturing facilities generating favorable volume leverage, strong project execution, and continuing effort to improve factory efficiencies while also managing product pricing that corresponds to current cost levels. 
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 8%, or $6.1 million, to $84.9 million in Fiscal 2024, primarily due to increased compensation expense and higher spending on infrastructure improvements. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to 8% in Fiscal 2024, compared to 11% in Fiscal 2023, resulting from higher revenues on our existing cost structure.
Income Tax Provision
We recorded an income tax provision of $46.2 million in Fiscal 2024, resulting in an effective tax rate of 24%, compared to an income tax provision of $14.4 million in Fiscal 2023 at an effective tax rate of 21%. In Fiscal 2024, the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the estimated Research and Development (R&D) Tax Credit and tax benefits related to the vesting of restricted stock units. These items were offset by state income tax expense, certain non-deductible items, and the tax impact of U.S. global intangible income. 
In Fiscal 2023, the effective tax rate approximated the U.S. federal statutory rate. The favorable impacts of the estimated R&D Tax Credit and the release of the valuation allowance previously recorded against the U.K. net deferred tax assets in the amount of $1.9 million were offset by state income tax expense, certain non-deductible items and the tax impact of U.S. global intangible income.
Net Income
In Fiscal 2024, we recorded net income of $149.8 million, or $12.29 per diluted share, compared to net income of $54.5 million, or $4.50 per diluted share in Fiscal 2023. This increase in net income is primarily due to higher revenues coupled with improved gross profit margins, as well as our disciplined cost structure.
Backlog 
The order backlog, which is our remaining unsatisfied performance obligations, represents the estimated transaction price for goods and services for which we have a material right, but work has not been performed. The order backlog at September 30, 2024 was $1.3 billion, consistent with our backlog at September 30, 2023. Bookings, net of cancellations and scope reductions, decreased by 24% in Fiscal 2024 to $1.1 billion, compared to $1.4 billion in Fiscal 2023. Despite strong bookings in Fiscal 2024, the decrease in bookings was due to a normalization of the oil and gas sector with fewer large orders awarded in this sector during Fiscal 2024. 
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
As of September 30, 2024, current assets exceeded current liabilities by 1.8 times.
Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments increased to $358.4 million at September 30, 2024, compared to $279.0 million at September 30, 2023. This increase in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments was primarily driven by our improved earnings due to increased project margins and volumes, partially offset by working capital allocated to projects in our order book, capital spending, as well as dividend payments. We believe that our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, as well as available borrowings under our U.S. credit facility, will be sufficient to support our future operating activities, working capital requirements, payment of dividends and capital spending, as well as research and development initiatives for the next twelve months and beyond. 
On October 4, 2023, we entered into a third amendment (the Third Amendment) to our credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (as amended, the U.S. Revolver). The Third Amendment which added Texas Capital Bank as Syndication Agent and a lender, increased the amount of the revolving line of credit from $125.0 million to $150.0 million, and extended the expiry date to October 4, 2028. The aggregate commitment of $150.0 million consists of $100.0 million committed by Bank of America and $50.0 million committed by Texas Capital Bank. As amended by the Third Amendment, the lesser of (a) $60 million, (b) 60% of available cash, and (c) the aggregate face amount of the issued but undrawn letters of credit that are not cash-secured shall be deducted from consolidated funded indebtedness, when calculating the consolidated net leverage ratio. We have the 
27
option to cash collateralize all or a portion of the letters of credit outstanding, which would favorably impact the consolidated funded indebtedness calculation and the consolidated net leverage ratio. On June 26, 2024, in connection with the expected discontinuation of the publication of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR), we further amended the U.S. Revolver by entering into a Canadian benchmark replacement conforming changes amendment with Bank of America, N.A. that added and amended certain terms related to the replacement of the CDOR as a benchmark rate with the forward-looking term rate based on the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average. On September 24, 2024, in connection with the expected discontinuation of the publication of the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index Rate as administered by the Bloomberg Index Service Limited (BSBY), we further amended the U.S. Revolver by entering into a conforming changes amendment with Bank of America, N.A. that added and amended certain terms related to the replacement of the BSBY as a benchmark rate with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  
As of September 30, 2024, there were no amounts borrowed under the U.S. Revolver, and letters of credit outstanding were $63.8 million. There was $86.2 million available for the issuance of letters of credit and borrowings under the U.S. Revolver as of September 30, 2024. For further information regarding our debt, see Notes G and H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Approximately $77.7 million of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at September 30, 2024 was held outside of the U.S. for our international operations. It is our intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings internationally in order to ensure sufficient working capital to support our international operations. In the event that we elect to repatriate some or all of the foreign earnings that were previously deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S., we may incur additional tax expense upon such repatriation under current tax laws.
Cash Flows
Operating Activities 
Operating activities provided net cash of $108.7 million during Fiscal 2024 and provided net cash of $182.6 million during Fiscal 2023. Cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by project volume and margins, as well as working capital requirements, the timing of milestone payments from our customers, and payment terms with our suppliers. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to working capital impact as we allocate capital to the projects in the order book, partially offset by higher net income resulting from increased project volume and improved project margins. 
Investing Activities
Investing activities used $21.9 million of cash during Fiscal 2024 and used $26.6 million in Fiscal 2023. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during Fiscal 2024 was primarily due to lower net purchase of short-term investments, partially offset by higher capital spending on property, plant and equipment in Fiscal 2024. During Fiscal 2024, our purchase of short-term investments was $9.7 million compared with net purchase of short-term investments of $18.8 million in Fiscal 2023. In July 2024, we made a cash purchase of land and buildings in Houston, Texas for $5.6 million to help further facilitate executing the current backlog as well as planning for modest future volume growth. In addition, we acquired intellectual property in December 2023 for a total consideration of $0.5 million, of which $250 thousand was paid in cash.
Financing Activities 
Net cash used in financing activities was $19.3 million during Fiscal 2024 compared to $13.1 million used during Fiscal 2023. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to cash payments related to shares withheld in lieu of employee tax withholding, largely driven by the significant increase in our share price during Fiscal 2024 compared to Fiscal 2023.
Planned Capital Spending
We have planned capital spending of approximately $11 million on a facility expansion project at our products factory in Houston. We expect to complete the expansion project by mid-Fiscal 2025. We have spent $1.5 million on the expansion project in Fiscal 2024. 
28
Other Commercial Commitments 
We are contingently liable for letters of credit and bank guarantees totaling $71.0 million as of September 30, 2024, with the following potential cash outflows in the event that we are unable to perform under our contracts (in thousands):

We also had surety bonds totaling $426.8 million that were outstanding at September 30, 2024. Surety bonds are primarily used to guarantee our contract performance to our customers.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. There can be no assurance that actual results will be consistent with those estimates. 
We believe the following accounting estimates to be critical in the preparation and reporting of our consolidated financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Our revenues are primarily generated from the manufacturing of custom-engineered products and systems under long-term fixed-price contracts under which we agree to manufacture various products such as traditional and arc-resistant distribution switchgear and control gear, medium-voltage circuit breakers, monitoring and control communications systems, motor control centers, switches and bus duct systems. These products may be sold separately as an engineered solution, but are typically integrated into custom-built enclosures which we also build. These enclosures are referred to as power control room substations (PCRs
®
), custom-engineered modules or electrical houses (E-Houses). Some contracts may also include the installation and commissioning of these enclosures.
Revenue from these contracts is generally recognized over time utilizing the cost-to-cost method. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. We believe that this method is the most accurate representation of our performance because it directly measures the value of the services transferred to the customer over time as we incur costs on our contracts. Contract costs include all direct materials, labor and indirect costs related to contract performance, which may include indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs.
29
Performance Obligations 
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract or with a customer to transfer a distinct good or service. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied. To determine the proper revenue recognition for contracts, we evaluate whether a contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation or, less commonly, whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one performance obligation. This evaluation of performance obligations requires significant judgment. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation where multiple engineered products and services are combined into a single custom-engineered solution. Our contracts include a standard one-year assurance warranty. Occasionally, we provide service-type warranties that will extend the warranty period. These extended warranties qualify as separate performance obligations, and revenue is deferred and recognized over the warranty period. If we determine during the evaluation of the contract that there are multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. 
Contract Estimates 
Actual revenues and project costs may vary from previous estimates due to changes in a variety of factors. The cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers, project managers and financial professionals. Factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, and the effect of any delays on our project performance. We periodically review our job performance, job conditions, estimated profitability and final contract settlements, including our estimate of total costs and make revisions to costs and income in the period in which the revisions are probable and reasonably estimable. We bear the risk of cost overruns in most of our contracts, which may result in reduced profits. Whenever revisions of estimated contract costs and contract values indicate that the contract costs will exceed estimated revenues, thus creating a loss, a provision for the total estimated loss is recorded in that period. See Note E of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to changes in contract estimates.
Variable Consideration
It is common for our long-term contracts to contain variable consideration that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. Due to the nature of our contracts, estimating total cost and revenue can be complex and subject to variability due to change orders, back charges, spare parts, early completion bonuses, customer allowances and liquidated damages. We estimate the amount of variable consideration based on the expected value method, which is the sum of probability-weighted amounts, or the most likely amount method, which uses various factors including experience with similar transactions and assessment of our anticipated performance. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if legally enforceable and to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur once the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. 
Contract Modifications
Contracts may be modified for changes in contract specifications and requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes the enforceable rights and obligations under the contract. Most of our contract modifications are for goods and services that are not distinct from the existing performance obligation. Contract modifications result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue based on our measure of progress for the performance obligation.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be realizable. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if recording an impairment of such asset is necessary. This requires us to make long-term forecasts of the future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review. Forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and future market conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. Future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period. The effect of any impairment would be reflected in operating income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition, we estimate the useful lives of our long-lived assets and other intangibles, and periodically review these estimates to determine whether these lives are appropriate.
30
Accruals for Contingent Liabilities
From time to time, contingencies such as insurance-related claims, liquidated damages and legal claims arise in the normal course of business. Pursuant to applicable accounting standards, we must evaluate such contingencies to subjectively determine the likelihood that an asset has been impaired, or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, as well as evaluate whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. If the likelihood is determined to be probable, and it can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss is recorded. The amounts we record for contingent liabilities require judgments regarding the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred. We use past experience and history, as well as the specific circumstances surrounding each contingent liability, including estimated legal costs, in evaluating the amount of liability that should be recorded. Actual results could differ from our estimates.
Warranty Costs
Estimated costs of warranties are accrued based on historical warranty claim costs in relation to current revenues. In addition, specific provisions are made when product failures are projected outside historical experience. Our standard terms and conditions of sale include a warranty for parts and service for one year. Occasionally, we provide service-type warranties that will extend the warranty period. Actual results could differ from our estimate.
Projects may require, on occasion, warranty terms that are longer than our standard terms due to the nature of the project. Extended warranty terms may be negotiated and included in our contracts. The allocated revenue associated with the extended warranty is deferred and recorded as a contract liability and recognized as revenue over the extended warranty period.
Accounting for Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, based on the income tax laws and rates in the countries in which operations are conducted, and income is earned. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Developing our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal, international and state income tax laws, regulations and strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and, if necessary, any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets. In assessing the extent to which net deferred tax assets may be realized, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets may not be realized. The ultimate realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Estimates may change as new events occur, estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased, additional information becomes available, or operating environments change, which may result in a full or partial reversal of the valuation allowance. We will continue to assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. Our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities.
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.
See Note I of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosures related to the valuation allowance recorded in relation to deferred taxes.

Item 7A.
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business. These risks primarily relate to fluctuations in commodity prices, foreign currency transactions and interest rates.
Commodity Price Risk
We are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain raw materials used in our products. While such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers, commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. We attempt to pass along such commodity price increases to our customers on a contract-by-contract basis to avoid a negative effect on our gross margin. We enter into derivative contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to commodity price risk. These contracts were immaterial to our earnings and cash flows for Fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022. In the future, we may enter into additional derivative contracts to further hedge our exposure to commodity price risk. Even though we continue to experience price volatility with some of our key raw materials and components, with the consideration of our hedging strategy, we believe our exposure to commodity price risk is minimal. 
Foreign Currency Transaction Risk
We have foreign operations that expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the British Pound Sterling, the Canadian Dollar and to a lesser extent the Singapore Dollar and the Euro, among others. Amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of stockholders’ equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe the exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because the foreign operations primarily invoice customers and collect payments in their respective local currencies or U.S. Dollars. Additionally, expenses associated with these transactions are generally contracted and paid for in the same local currencies. Our realized foreign exchange loss was $0.8 million and $0.4 million, respectively for Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023. These losses were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. From time to time, our foreign subsidiaries may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge their foreign currency exposures, if any. These contracts were insignificant to our earnings and cash flows for Fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022. We do not typically hedge our exposure to potential foreign currency translation adjustments.

Our accumulated other comprehensive loss, which is included as a component of stockholders’ equity, was $24.4 million as of September 30, 2024, a decrease of $2.5 million compared to September 30, 2023. This decrease in comprehensive loss was primarily a result of fluctuations in the currency exchange rates for the Canadian Dollar and British Pound Sterling as we re-measured the foreign operations of those divisions. 
Interest Rate Risk
If we borrow under our U.S. Revolver, we will be subject to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates related to our floating rate bank credit facility. Because we did not have any outstanding borrowings under our U.S. Revolver as of both September 30, 2024 and 2023, we have not experienced any significant interest rate risk for each of the periods presented in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Powell Industries, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Powell Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control - Integrated Framework
 (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions 
34
and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Revenue Recognition - Long-term fixed price contracts
As described in Notes B and E to the consolidated financial statements, approximately 95% of the Company’s total revenue of $1,012 million for the year ended September 30, 2024 was generated from the manufacturing of custom-engineered products and systems under long-term fixed-price contracts. Revenue from these contracts is generally recognized over time utilizing the cost-to-cost method to measure the extent of progress toward the completion of the performance obligation and the recognition of revenue over time. Management believes that this method is the most accurate representation of performance, because it directly measures the value of the services transferred to the customer over time as costs are incurred on the contracts. Contract costs include all direct materials, labor, and indirect costs related to contract performance, which may include indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Due to the nature of the contracts, estimating total cost and revenue can be complex and subject to variability due to change orders, back charges, spare parts, early completion bonuses, customer allowances and liquidated damages. Management estimates the amount of variable consideration based on the expected value method, which is the sum of the probability-weighted amount, or the most likely amount method which uses various factors including experience with similar transactions and assessment of anticipated performance. 
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognized over time utilizing the cost-to-cost method is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when determining the estimated total cost and revenue, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating management’s judgment about assumptions related to the estimates of costs to complete and liquidated damages. 
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the determination of total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation and determination of total contract price. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating and testing management’s process for determining the estimated total cost and revenue for a sample of contracts, which included (i) obtaining executed purchase orders and agreements, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the method to measure estimated total cost and revenue, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by management, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to the total estimated costs at completion and liquidated damages used by management and considering the factors that can affect 
35
the accuracy of those estimates. Evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to estimated total cost involved assessing management’s ability to reasonably estimate total costs to complete and liquidated damages by testing management’s process to evaluate the remaining costs related to the performance obligation and evaluating the timely identification of circumstances which may warrant a modification to the total estimated costs or liquidated damages.

POWELL INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
A. 
Business and Organization
Powell Industries, Inc. (we, us, our, Powell or the Company) is a Delaware corporation founded by William E. Powell in 1947. Our major subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned, include Powell Electrical Systems, Inc.; Powell (UK) Limited; Powell Canada Inc.; and Powell Industries International, B.V.
We are headquartered in Houston, Texas, and primarily serve the oil and gas and petrochemical markets, the electric utility market, and commercial and other industrial markets.

Beyond these major markets, we also provide products and services to the light rail traction power market and other markets that include universities and government entities. We are continuously developing new channels to electrical markets through original equipment manufacturers and distribution market channels.
Our principal products include integrated power control room substations (PCRs
®
), custom-engineered modules, electrical houses (E-Houses), traditional and arc-resistant distribution switchgear and control gear, medium-voltage circuit breakers, monitoring and control communications systems, motor c
ontrol centers, switches and bus duct systems. These products are designed for application voltages ranging from 480 volts to 38,000 volts. Our product scope includes designs tested to meet both United States (U.S.) and international standards, under both the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). We also provide spare parts, retrofit and retrofill components for existing systems, and replacement circuit breakers for obsolete switchgear no longer produced by the original manufacturer. Our principal services include field service inspection, installation, commissioning, modification and repair services. 
We seek to establish long-term relationships with the end users of our systems as well as design and construction engineering firms contracted by those end users. We believe that our culture of safety and focus on customer satisfaction, along with our financial strength, allow us to continue to capitalize on opportunities in the industries we serve.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. The most significant estimates used in our consolidated financial statements affect revenue recognition and estimated cost recognition on our customer contracts, allowance for credit losses, provision for excess and obsolete inventory, warranty accruals and income taxes. The amounts recorded for warranties, legal, income taxes, impairment of long-lived assets (when applicable), liquidated damages and other contingent liabilities require judgments regarding the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred. We base our estimates on historical experience, forecasts and various other assumptions, as well as the specific circumstances surrounding these contingent liabilities, in evaluating the amount of liability that should be recorded. Additionally, the basis for recognition of deferred tax assets requires estimates related to future income and other assumptions regarding timing and future profitability because the ultimate realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during periods in which temporary differences become deductible. Estimates routinely change as new events occur, additional information becomes available or operating environments change. Actual results may differ from our prior estimates.
Cash and Investments
Cash and cash equivalents – 
Cash and cash equivalents, primarily funds held in money market savings instruments, are reported at their current carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments, and are included in cash and cash equivalents in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Short-term investments –
 Short-term investments include time deposits with original maturities of three months or more.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, receivables, deferred compensation, payables and debt obligations. Except as described below, due to the short-term nature of account receivables and account payables, their book values are representative of their fair values.

Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for credit losses. We maintain and continually assess the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses representing our estimate for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due to us. This estimated allowance is based on historical experience of uncollected accounts, the level of past due accounts, the overall level of outstanding accounts receivable, information about specific customers with respect to their inability to make payments and expectations of future conditions that could impact the collectability of accounts receivable. Future changes in our customers’ operating performance and cash flows, or in general economic conditions, could have an impact on their ability to fully pay these amounts, which could have a material impact on our operating results. In most cases, receivables are not collateralized. However, we utilize letters of credit to secure payment on projects when possible.
 Retention amounts are in accordance with applicable provisions of contracts and become due upon completion of contractual requirements. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had retention amounts of $
7.1
 million and $
7.4
 million, respectively. Of the

retained amount at September 30, 2024, $
6.1
 million is expected to be collected in the next twelve months and is recorded in accounts receivable. The remaining $
1.0
 million is recorded in other assets and is expected to be collected beyond September 30, 2025.
Contract Balances
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections affects accounts receivable, contract assets and contract liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Contract assets are recorded when revenues are recognized in excess of amounts billed for fixed-price contracts as determined by the billing milestone schedule. Contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable when billing milestones have been met, or we have an unconditional right to payment. 
Contract liabilities typically represent advance payments from contractual billing milestones and billings in excess of revenue recognized. It is unusual to have advanced milestone payments with a term greater than one year, which could represent a financing component on the contract.
Our contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period and are generally classified as current.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using weighted-average methods and include the cost of materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. We use estimates in determining the level of reserves required to state inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Our estimates are based on market activity levels, production requirements, the physical condition of products and technological innovation. Changes in any of these factors may result in adjustments to the carrying value of inventory.
43
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and improvements, which extend the useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated. Upon retirement or disposition of property, plant and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be realizable. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if recording an impairment of such asset is necessary. If an impairment is indicated, we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long-lived asset. This requires us to make long-term forecasts of the future revenues and the costs related to the assets subject to review. Forecasts require assumptions about demand for our products and future market conditions. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment, and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. Future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period. The effect of any impairment would be reflected in operating income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition, we estimate the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment and periodically review these estimates to determine whether these lives are appropriate.
Income Taxes
We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, based on the income tax laws and rates in the countries in which operations are conducted, and income is earned. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Developing our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal, international and state income tax laws, regulations and strategies, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and, if necessary, any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets. In assessing the extent to which net deferred tax assets may be realized, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets may not be realized. The ultimate realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Estimates may change as new events occur, estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased, additional information becomes available or operating environments change, which may result in a full or partial reversal of the valuation allowance. We will continue to assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. Our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities.
The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements.
Revenue Recognition
Our revenues are primarily generated from the manufacturing of custom-engineered products and systems under long-term, fixed-price contracts that may last from 
one month
 to several years, depending on the contract. Revenue from these contracts is generally recognized over time utilizing the cost-to-cost method. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. We believe that this method is the most accurate representation of our performance because it directly measures the value of the services transferred to the customer over time as we incur costs on our contracts. Contract costs include all direct materials, labor and indirect costs related to contract performance, which may include indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs.
We also have contracts to provide field service inspection, installation, commissioning, modification, and repair services, as well as retrofit and retrofill components for existing systems. If the service contract terms give us the right to invoice the customer for an amount that corresponds directly with the value of our performance completed to date (i.e., a service contract in 
44
which we bill a fixed amount for each hour of service provided), then we recognize revenue over time in each reporting period corresponding to the amount that we have the right to invoice. Our performance obligations are satisfied as the work progresses. 
We also have sales orders for spare parts and replacement circuit breakers for switchgear that are obsolete or that are no longer produced by the original manufacturer. Revenues from these sales orders are recognized at the time we fulfill our performance obligation to the customer, which is typically upon shipment. 
Additionally, some contracts may contain a cancellation clause that could limit the amount of revenue we are able to recognize over time. In these instances, revenue and costs associated with these contracts are deferred and recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation is fulfilled.
Selling and administrative costs incurred in relation to obtaining a contract are typically expensed as incurred. We periodically utilize a third-party sales agent to obtain a contract and will pay a commission to that agent. We record the full commission liability to the third-party sales agents at the order date, with a corresponding deferred asset. As the project progresses, we record commission expense based on percentage of completion rates that correlate to the project and reduce the deferred asset. Once we have been paid by the customer, we pay the commission, and the liability is reduced.
Warranty Costs
Estimated costs of warranties are accrued based on historical warranty claim costs in relation to current revenues. In addition, specific provisions are made when product failures are projected outside historical experience. Our standard terms and conditions of sale include a warranty for parts and service for one year. Occasionally, we provide service-type warranties that will extend the warranty period. Actual results could differ from our estimate.
Projects may require, on occasion, warranty terms that are longer than our standard terms due to the nature of the project. Extended warranty terms may be negotiated and included in our contracts. The allocated revenue associated with the extended warranty is deferred and recorded as a contract liability and recognized as revenue over the extended warranty period.
Research and Development Expense
Research and development activities are directed toward the development of new products and processes as well as improvements in existing products and processes. These costs, which primarily include salaries, contract services and supplies, are expensed as incurred.
 Such amounts were $
9.4
 million, $
6.2
 million and $
7.0
 million in Fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Foreign Currency Translation
The functional currency for our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency in which the entity is located. The financial statements of all subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar have been translated into U.S. Dollars. All assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into U.S. Dollars using period-end exchange rates, and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates during the respective period. The U.S. Dollar results that arise from such translation, as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of a long-term investment nature, are included in the cumulative currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders’ equity.
Stock-Based Compensation
We measure stock-based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. Compensation expense is recognized over the period during which the recipient is required to provide service in exchange for the awards, typically the vesting period. Excess income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation expense are recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cash paid when directly withholding shares on an employee's behalf for tax withholding purposes is classified as a financing activity. We account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimate expected forfeitures.
Accounting Standards Updates and Disclosure Rules Issued but Not Yet Adopted
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
, which requires that public entities disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) on an annual and interim basis. It also requires that public entities disclose the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures in assessing segment performance and resource allocation. Additionally, it requires that all existing annual disclosures about segment profit or loss and assets must be provided on an interim basis and clarifies that single 
45
reportable segment entities are subject to the disclosure requirement under Topic 280 in its entirety. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. A public entity should apply ASU 2023-07 retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impacts of the new standard.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, 
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
, which enhances the transparency of income tax disclosures. It requires greater disaggregation of information in the tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and should be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application and early adoption are permitted. We are currently evaluating the impacts of the new standard.
In March 2024, the SEC adopted final rules designed to enhance and standardize disclosures related to the risks and impacts of climate-related matters. The final rules require registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. Such information relates to climate-related risks and risk management processes for, and governance and oversight activities of, such risks. The final rules also include requirements to disclose the financial effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions in the audited financial statements. In addition, larger registrants will be required to disclose information about greenhouse gas emissions, which will be subject to a phased-in assurance requirement. These disclosure requirements were scheduled to be effective for the Company's fiscal year beginning October 1, 2025. However, in April 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed the final rules as a result of pending legal challenges. We are currently evaluating the impacts of the final rules on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Revenue
Revenue Recognition
Our revenues are primarily generated from the manufacturing of custom-engineered products and systems under long-term fixed-price contracts under which we agree to manufacture various products such as traditional and arc-resistant distribution switchgear and control gear, medium-voltage circuit breakers, monitoring and control communications systems, motor control centers, switches and bus duct systems. These products may be sold separately as an engineered solution but are typically integrated into custom-built enclosures which we also build. These enclosures are referred to as power control room substations (PCRs
®
), custom-engineered modules or electrical houses (E-Houses). Some contracts may also include the installation and the commissioning of these enclosures. 
Revenue from these contracts is generally recognized over time utilizing the cost-to-cost method. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. We believe that this method is the most accurate representation of our performance because it directly measures the value of the services transferred to the customer over time as we incur costs on our contracts. Contract costs include all direct materials, labor and indirect costs related to contract performance, which may include indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. 
We also have contracts to provide field service inspection, installation, commissioning, modification, and repair services, as well as retrofit and retrofill components for existing systems. If the service contract terms give us the right to invoice the customer for an amount that corresponds directly with the value of our performance completed to date (i.e., a service contract in which we bill a fixed amount for each hour of service provided), then we recognize revenue over time in each reporting period corresponding to the amount that we have the right to invoice. Our performance obligations are satisfied as the work progresses. 
47
Revenues from our custom-engineered products and value-added services transferred to customers over time accounted for approximately 
95
%  and 
94
% of revenues for the years ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.  
We also have sales orders for spare parts and replacement circuit breakers for switchgear that are obsolete or that are no longer produced by the original manufacturer. Revenues from these sales orders are recognized at the time we fulfill our performance obligation to the customer, which is typically upon shipment and represented approximately 
5
% and 
6
% of revenues for the years ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.
Additionally, some contracts may contain a cancellation clause that could limit the amount of revenue we are able to recognize over time. In these instances, revenue and costs associated with these contracts are deferred and recognized at a point in time when the performance obligation is fulfilled.
Selling and administrative costs incurred in relation to obtaining a contract are typically expensed as incurred. We periodically utilize a third-party sales agent to obtain a contract and will pay a commission to that agent. We record the full commission liability to the third-party sales agents at the order date, with a corresponding deferred asset. As the project progresses, we record commission expense based on percentage of completion rates that correlate to the project and reduce the deferred asset. Once we have been paid by the customer, we pay the commission, and the deferred liability is reduced.

Performance Obligations  
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract or with a customer to transfer a distinct good or service. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied. To determine the proper revenue recognition for contracts, we evaluate whether a contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation or, less commonly, whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as one performance obligation. This evaluation of performance obligations requires significant judgment. The majority of our contracts have a single performance obligation where multiple engineered products and services are combined into a single custom-engineered solution. Our contracts include a standard 
one-year
 assurance warranty. Occasionally, we provide service-type warranties that will extend the warranty period. These extended warranties qualify as a separate performance obligation, and revenue is deferred and recognized over the warranty period. If we determine during the evaluation of the contract that there are multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. 
Remaining unsatisfied performance obligations, which we refer to as backlog, represent the estimated transaction price for goods and services for which we have a material right, but work has not been performed.
 As of September 30, 2024, we had backlog of $
1.3
 billion, of which approximately $
848.5
 million is expected to be recognized as revenue within the next 
twelve months
.

Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results as orders may be cancelled or modified by our customers. Our backlog does not include service and maintenance-type contracts for which we have the right to invoice as services are performed.   
Contract Estimates
Actual revenues and project costs may vary from previous estimates due to changes in a variety of factors. The cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our engineers, project managers and financial professionals. Factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, and the effect of any delays on our project performance. We periodically review our job performance, job conditions, estimated profitability and final contract settlements, including our estimate of total costs and make revisions to costs and income in the period in which the revisions are probable and reasonably estimable. We bear the risk of cost overruns in most of our contracts, which may result in reduced profits. Whenever revisions of estimated contract costs and contract values indicate that the contract costs will exceed estimated revenues, thus creating a loss, a provision for the total estimated loss is recorded in that period.
For the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our operating results were positively impacted by $
16.9
 million and $
13.6
 million, respectively, as a result of net changes in contract estimates related to projects in progress at the beginning of the respective period. These changes in estimates resulted primarily from favorable project execution, reduced cost estimates and negotiations of variable consideration, discussed below, as well as revenue recognized from project cancellations and other changes in facts and circumstances during these periods. Project cancellations increased gross profit by $
2.2
 million and $
4.3
 million, respectively, for the years ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Gross unfavorable changes in contract estimates were immaterial for the years ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.
48
Variable Consideration
It is common for our long-term contracts to contain variable consideration that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. Due to the nature of our contracts, estimating total cost and revenue can be complex and subject to variability due to change orders, back charges, spare parts, early completion bonuses, customer allowances and liquidated damages. We estimate the amount of variable consideration based on the expected value method, which is the sum of the probability-weighted amounts, or the most likely amount method which uses various factors including experience with similar transactions and assessment of our anticipated performance. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if legally enforceable and to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur once the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. 
Contract Modifications
Contracts may be modified for changes in contract specifications and requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes the enforceable rights and obligations under the contract. Most of our contract modifications are for goods and services that are not distinct from the existing performance obligation. Contract modifications result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue based on our measure of progress for the performance obligation.
Contract Balances
The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections affects accounts receivable, contract assets and contract liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Contract assets are recorded when revenues are recognized in excess of amounts billed for fixed-price contracts as determined by the billing milestone schedule. Contract assets are transferred to accounts receivable when billing milestones have been met, or we have an unconditional right to payment. 
Contract liabilities typically represent advance payments from contractual billing milestones and billings in excess of revenue recognized. It is unusual to have advanced milestone payments with a term greater than one year, which could represent a financing component on the contract.
Our contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period and are generally classified as current.

Contract assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 are summarized below (in thousands):

Our net contract billing position remained a net liability at both September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, primarily due to favorable contract billing milestones. We typically allocate a significant percentage of the progress billing to the early stages of the contract. To determine the amount of revenue recognized during the period from contract liabilities, we first allocate revenue to the individual contract liability balance outstanding at the beginning of the period until the revenue exceeds that balance. During the year ended September 30, 2024, we recognized revenue of $
246.2
 million that was related to contract liabilities outstanding at September 30, 2023.
The timing of our invoice process is typically dependent on the completion of certain milestones and contract terms and subject to agreement by our customer. Payment is typically expected within 30 days of invoice. Any uncollected invoiced amounts for our performance obligations recognized over time, including contract retentions, are recorded as accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain contracts allow customers to withhold a small percentage of billings pursuant to retainage provisions, and such amounts are generally due upon completion of the contract and acceptance of the project by the customer. Based on our experience in recent years, the majority of these retainage balances are expected to be collected within approximately twelve months.
 As of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had retention amounts of $
7.1
 million and $
7.4
 million, respectively. Of the retained amount at September 30, 2024, $
6.1
 million is expected to be collected in the next twelve months and is recorded in accounts receivable. The remaining $
1.0
 million is recorded in other assets.

In December 2023, we acquired intellectual property for a total consideration of $
0.5
 million, of which $
250
 thousand was paid in cash at the acquisition date. The intellectual property is not yet subject to amortization. Our intangible assets also include goodwill of $
1.0
 million, which is not being amortized. 
No
 impairment expense has been recorded for the last three fiscal years.

G. 
Long-Term Debt
U.S. Revolver 
On October 4, 2023, we entered into a third amendment (the Third Amendment) to our credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (as amended, the U.S. Revolver). The Third Amendment which added Texas Capital Bank as Syndication Agent and a lender, increased the amount of the revolving line of credit from $
125.0
 million to $
150.0
 million, and extended the expiry date to October 4, 2028. The aggregate commitment of $
150.0
 million consists of $
100.0
 million committed by Bank of America and $
50.0
 million committed by Texas Capital Bank. As amended by the Third Amendment, the lesser of (a) $
60.0
 million, (b) 
60
% of available cash, and (c) the aggregate face amount of the issued but undrawn letters of credit that are not cash-secured shall be deducted from consolidated funded indebtedness, when calculating the consolidated net leverage ratio. We have the option to cash collateralize all or a portion of the letters of credit outstanding, which would favorably impact the consolidated funded indebtedness calculation and the consolidated net leverage ratio. 
On June 26, 2024, in connection with the expected discontinuation of the publication of the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR), we further amended the U.S. Revolver by entering into a Canadian benchmark replacement conforming changes amendment with Bank of America, N.A. that added and amended certain terms related to the replacement of the CDOR as a benchmark rate with the forward-looking term rate based on the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average. On September 24, 2024, in connection with the expected discontinuation of the publication of the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index Rate as administered by the Bloomberg Index Service Limited (BSBY), we further amended the U.S. Revolver by entering into a conforming changes amendment with Bank of America, N.A. that added and amended certain terms related to the replacement of the BSBY as a benchmark rate with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.   
50
As of September 30, 2024, there were 
no
 amounts borrowed under the U.S. Revolver, and letters of credit outstanding were $
63.8
 million. There was $
86.2
 million available for the issuance of letters of credit and borrowings under the U.S. Revolver as of September 30, 2024. 
As of September 30, 2024, we are required to maintain certain financial covenants, the most significant of which are a consolidated net leverage ratio less than 
3.0
 to 1.0 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of greater than 
3.0
 to 1.0. Our most restrictive covenant, the consolidated net leverage ratio, is the ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation (EBITDAS) to funded indebtedness. An increase in indebtedness, which includes letters of credit, or a decrease in EBITDAS could restrict our ability to issue letters of credit or borrow under the U.S. Revolver. Additionally, we must maintain a consolidated cash balance of $
60
 million at all times, which can be deducted from the letters of credit outstanding as noted above. The U.S. Revolver also contains a "material adverse effect" clause which is a material change in our operations, business, properties, liabilities or condition (financial or otherwise) or a material impairment of our ability to perform our obligations under the U.S. Revolver. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of the U.S. Revolver. 
The U.S. Revolver allows the Company to elect that any borrowing under the facility bears an interest rate based on either the base rate or the eurocurrency rate, in each case, plus the applicable rate. The base rate is generally the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 
0.50
%, (b) the Bank of America prime rate or (c) the BSBY rate plus 
1.00
%. The BSBY rate will be replaced by the SOFR rate, effective November 20, 2024. The applicable rate is generally a range from 
0
% to 
2
% depending on the type of loan and the Company's consolidated net leverage ratio. 
The U.S. Revolver is collateralized by a pledge of 
100
% of the voting capital stock of each of our domestic subsidiaries and 
65
% of the voting capital stock of each non-domestic subsidiary. The U.S. Revolver provides for customary events of default and carries cross-default provisions with other existing debt agreements. If an event of default (as defined in the U.S. Revolver) occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the U.S. Revolver, amounts and letters of credit outstanding under the U.S. Revolver may be accelerated and may become immediately due and payable. 
Industrial Development Revenue Bonds
We borrowed $
8.0
 million in October 2001 through a loan agreement funded with proceeds from tax-exempt industrial development revenue bonds (Bonds) for the completion of our Northlake, Illinois facility. The Bonds matured on October 1, 2021, and our final payment of $
0.4
 million was made upon maturity.

H. 
Commitments and Contingencies
Letters of Credit, Bank Guarantees and Bonds
Certain customers require us to post letters of credit, bank guarantees or surety bonds. These security instruments assure that we will perform under the terms of our contract. In the event of default, the counterparty may demand payment from the bank under a letter of credit or bank guarantee, or performance by the surety under a bond. To date, there have been no significant draws or claims related to security instruments for the periods reported. We were contingently liable for letters of credit of $
63.8
 million as of September 30, 2024. We also had outstanding surety bonds totaling $
426.8
 million, with additional bonding capacity of $
773.2
 million available, at September 30, 2024. We have strong surety relationships; however, a change in market conditions or the sureties' assessment of our financial position could cause the sureties to require cash collateralization for undischarged liabilities under the bonds.
We have a $
20.1
 million facility agreement (Facility Agreement) between Powell (UK) Limited and a large international bank that provides Powell (UK) Limited the ability to enter into bank guarantees as well as forward exchange contracts and currency options. At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding guarantees totaling $
7.2
 million, with additional capacity of $
12.9
 million available under this Facility Agreement. The Facility Agreement provides for customary events of default and carries cross-default provisions with the U.S. Revolver. If an event of default (as defined in the Facility Agreement) occurs and is continuing, per the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, obligations outstanding under the Facility Agreement may be accelerated and declared immediately due and payable. Additionally, we are required to maintain cash collateral for guarantees greater than 
two years
. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of the Facility Agreement.
51
Litigation 
We are involved in various legal proceedings, claims and other disputes arising from our commercial operations, projects, employees and other matters which, in general, are subject to uncertainties and in which the outcomes are not predictable. Although we can give no assurances about the resolution of pending claims, litigation or other disputes, and the effect such outcomes may have on us, management believes that any ultimate liability resulting from the outcome of such proceedings, to the extent not otherwise provided or covered by insurance, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.
Liquidated Damages
Certain of our customer contracts have schedule and performance obligation clauses that, if we fail to meet them, could require us to pay liquidated damages. Each individual contract defines the conditions under which the customer may make a claim against us. As of September 30, 2024, certain contracts had a probable exposure to liquidated damage claims of $
4.1
 million, which could possibly increase to $
4.6
 million under certain circumstances. Based on our actual or projected failure to meet these various contractual commitments, $
3.2
 million has been recorded as a reduction to revenue. We will attempt to obtain change orders, contract extensions or accelerate project completion, which may resolve the potential for any unrecorded liquidated damage claims. Should we fail to achieve relief on some or all of these contractual obligations, we could be required to pay additional liquidated damages, which could negatively impact our future operating results.

Effective rate

%
(

%
Our income tax provision reflects an effective tax rate on pre-tax results of 
24
% in Fiscal 2024 compared to 
21
% and negative 
40
% in Fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. The income tax provision for Fiscal 2024 was favorably impacted by the current year estimated Research and Development (R&D) Tax Credit and benefits related to the vesting of restricted stock units. These items were offset by state income tax expense, the tax expense related to certain nondeductible expenses and an income inclusion related to U.S. global intangible income. 
The income tax provision for Fiscal 2023 was favorably impacted by the reversal of a valuation allowance on the United Kingdom (U.K.) deferred tax assets that were previously fully reserved, in addition to the estimated R&D Tax Credit. These items were offset by state tax expense, the tax expense related to certain nondeductible expenses and an income inclusion related to U.S. global intangible income.
The income tax benefit for Fiscal 2022 was largely a result of the reversal of a valuation allowance on the Canadian deferred tax assets that were previously fully reserved, in addition to the estimated R&D Tax Credit. These items were partially offset by the tax expense related to certain nondeductible expenses, the gain on the disposition of a small, non-core division of our Canadian operations and an income inclusion related to U.S. global intangible income.
We record and maintain valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets of various foreign jurisdictions until sufficient evidence is available to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be recognized. As of each reporting date, management considers new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect its view of the future realization of deferred tax assets. During Fiscal 2024, management determined that there was sufficient positive evidence to conclude that certain Canadian tax credits in the amount of $
0.5
 million were realizable. The determination was based on the operating results of the past three years and the anticipated future taxable income from our Canadian operations. The release of the valuation allowance resulted in a $
0.5
 million tax benefit and a corresponding increase in the deferred tax assets.
During the period ended September 30, 2023, management determined that there was sufficient positive evidence to conclude that the U.K. net deferred tax assets of $
1.9
 million were realizable. This determination was based on operating results over the past three years and anticipated future taxable income from our U.K. operations. The valuation allowance was released accordingly, and a $
1.9
 million tax benefit and corresponding increase in the deferred tax assets were recorded. Likewise, during the period ended June 30, 2022, management concluded that Canadian net deferred tax assets of $
5.9
 million were realizable based on current and anticipated market conditions, continued market diversification, operating results over the past three years and anticipated future taxable income from our Canadian operations. The release of the Canadian valuation allowance resulted in a $
5.9
 million tax benefit and a corresponding increase in the deferred tax assets. 
We have not recorded deferred income taxes on $
23.0
 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because of management’s intent to indefinitely reinvest such earnings. Upon distribution of these earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. It is not practical, however, to estimate the amount of taxes that may be payable on the eventual remittance of these earnings.
We are subject to income tax in the U.S., multiple state jurisdictions and certain international jurisdictions, primarily the U.K. and Canada. The significant jurisdictions that remain open to examination are as follows: Canada 2017 – 2023, U.K. 2023 and 
53
U.S. federal and state 2020 – 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any state audits underway that would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation.
We have deferred tax assets related to international net operating loss carryforwards of $
0.5
 million that are not reserved with a valuation allowance available to offset future tax liabilities in the respective jurisdictions. The majority of these net operating loss carryforwards are related to our Canadian operations and expire beginning in 2035. The remaining unreserved net operating loss carryforwards related to other jurisdictions have an indefinite carryforward period. As of September 30, 2024, the majority of our tax credit carryforwards are fully reserved with a valuation allowance.
The net decrease in the total valuation allowance during the year was $
0.4
 million, which was largely a result of the reversal of the Canadian valuation allowance on certain tax credits. In assessing the realizability of net deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets may not be realized. The ultimate realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.

1.5

1.6
 million, and $
1.1
 million, respectively, of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. Our policy is to recognize 
54
interest and penalties related to income tax matters as tax expense. The amount of interest and penalty expense recorded for the year ended September 30, 2024 was not material.
Management believes that, within the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately $
0.3
 million due to the expiration of certain federal statutes of limitations. We are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the timing of future cash outflows, if any, associated with the remaining unrecognized tax benefits for the open periods of fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 – 2024.
Management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs.

J. 
Employee Benefit Plans
Retirement Plans
We have defined employee contribution plans for substantially all of our U.S. employees (401k plan) and our Canadian employees (Registered Retirement Savings Plan). We recognized expenses under these plans primarily related to matching contributions of $
4.4
 million, $
3.4
 million and $
3.0
 million in Fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Deferred Compensation
We offer a non-qualified deferred compensation plan to a select group of highly compensated individuals (as defined). The plan permits the deferral of up to 
50
% of a participant’s base salary and 
100
% of a participant’s annual incentive. The deferrals are held in a separate irrevocable rabbi trust (the Rabbi Trust), which has been established to administer the plan. The Rabbi Trust is intended to be used as a source of funds to match respective funding obligations to participants. The assets of the trust are subject to the claims of our creditors in the event that we become insolvent. Consequently, the Rabbi Trust qualifies as a grantor trust for income tax purposes. We make periodic payments into company-owned life insurance policies held in the Rabbi Trust to fund the expected obligations arising under this plan. Changes in the deferred compensation balance are recorded to compensation expense and reflected within the selling, general and administrative expenses line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The plan is not qualified under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue code. We recorded net compensation expense adjustments of $
0.2
 million related to this plan in Fiscal 2024 and $
0.8
 million in Fiscal 2023. At September 30, 2024, total assets held in the Rabbi Trust were $
12.3
 million and recorded in other assets and the liability was $
12.0
 million and recorded in deferred compensation in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The $
12.3
 million of assets held in the Rabbi Trust is invested in company-owned life insurance policies.
Retiree Medical Plan
We have an unfunded plan that extends health benefits to retirees that are also available to active employees under our existing health plans. The current plan provides coverage for employees with at least 
10
 years of service who are age 
55
 or older but less than 
65
. Effective January 1, 2023, eligibility for postretirement medical benefits changed to age 
60
 with 
10
 years of continuous service. Employees who are under age 
50
 as of January 1, 2023 or who are hired after January 1, 2023 are no longer eligible for postretirement medical benefits. The retiree is required to pay the COBRA rate less a subsidy provided by us based on years of service at the time of retirement. The unfunded liability is recorded in other long-term liabilities and was $
0.3
 million as of September 30, 2024 and $
0.5
 million as of September 30, 2023. Our net periodic postretirement costs were immaterial for all periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Due to the immateriality of the costs and liabilities of this plan, no further disclosure is being presented.

K. 
Stock-Based Compensation
We have the following stock-based compensation plans:
Restricted Stock Units
In February 2014, our stockholders approved and adopted at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2014 Plan), which replaced our 2006 Equity Compensation Plan (2006 Plan). Persons eligible to receive awards under the 2014 Plan include our officers and employees. The 2014 Plan authorizes stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based awards, as well as certain other awards. In February 2023, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2014 Plan that extended the term of the 2014 Plan by 
five years
 and increased the number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the plan by 
600,000
 shares for a total of 
1,350,000
 shares.
In accordance with the 2014 Plan, the Compensation and Human Capital Committee has authorized grants of RSUs to certain officers and key employees of the Company. The fair value of the RSUs is based on the price of our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Market on the grant dates. Typically, these grants vest over a 
three-year
 period from the date of issuance and are a blend of time-based and performance-based shares. 
Fifty
 percent of the grant is time-based and vests over a 
three-year
 period on each anniversary of the grant date, based on continued employment. The remaining 
fifty
 percent of the grant is earned based on the 
three-year
 earnings and safety performance of the Company following the grant date. At September 30, 2024, there were 
192,011
 RSUs outstanding. The RSUs do not have voting rights but do receive dividend equivalents upon vesting, which are accrued quarterly. Additionally, the shares of common stock underlying the RSUs are not considered issued and outstanding until vested and common stock is issued.

Restricted Stock
In February 2022, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2014 Non-Employee Director Equity Incentive Plan (the 2014 Director Plan) that extended the term of the 2014 Director Plan by 
ten years
 and increased the number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2014 Director Plan by 
200,000
 shares for a total of 
350,000
 shares. The plan is administered by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee. Eligibility to participate in the plan is limited to those individuals who are members of the Board of Directors of the Company and who are not employees of the Company or any affiliate of the Company.
Under the terms of the 2014 Director Plan, the maximum number of shares that may be granted during any calendar year to any individual is 
12,000
 shares. The total number of shares that may be issued for awards to any single participant during a calendar year for other stock-based awards (excluding stock options and stock appreciation rights) is 
4,000
 shares. In December 2023, the Company's Compensation and Human Capital Committee revised the non-employee directors' annual restricted stock compensation from a fixed-shares arrangement to a fixed-value arrangement, retrospectively effective on October 1, 2023. Prior to October 1, 2023, each non-employee director received 
2,400
 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock annually. 
Fifty
 percent of the restricted stock granted to each of our non-employee directors was vested immediately, while the remaining 
fifty
 percent vested on the anniversary of the grant date. Compensation expense was recognized immediately for the first 
fifty
 percent of the restricted stock granted, while compensation expense for the remaining 
fifty
 percent was recognized over the remaining vesting period. Subsequent to October 1, 2023, each non-employee director shall receive restricted shares of the Company's common stock valued at $
0.1
 million annually. The number of granted shares is calculated by dividing the $
0.1
 million by the average of high and low prices of our common stock on the grant date. The shares shall vest on the earlier of the grant anniversary date or the date of the next annual meeting of stockholders, whichever occurs first.   
Under this 2014 Director Plan, in February 2024, 
4,620
 shares of restricted stock were issued to our non-employee directors at a price of $
153.81
 per share. In February 2023, we issued 
16,800
 shares of restricted stock to our non-employee directors at a price of $
43.22
 per share. The total number of shares of common stock available for future awards under the 2014 Director plan 
56
was 
185,980
 shares as of September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were 
4,620
 shares and 
8,400
 shares, respectively, of unvested restricted stock outstanding.  
Compensation Expense
Total compensation expense related to restricted stock grants under all plans was $
0.6
 million, $
0.6
 million and $
0.4
 million for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Total compensation expense related to RSUs under all plans was $
4.2
 million, $
4.0
 million and $
3.7
 million

for the years ended September 30, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
We record the amortization of non-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units as an increase to additional paid-in capital. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, amounts of deferred compensation expense not yet recognized related to non-vested stock and RSUs totaled $
2.1
 million and $
1.4
 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the total weighted average remaining contractual life of our non-vested restricted stock and RSUs is approximately 
five months
 and 
1.23
 years, respectively.

L. 
Fair Value Measurements
We measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value. Fair value is defined as an “exit price,” which represents the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in valuing an asset or liability. The accounting guidance requires the use of valuation techniques to measure fair value that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. As a basis for considering such assumptions and inputs, a fair value hierarchy has been established that identifies and prioritizes three levels of inputs to be used in measuring fair value.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
Level 1 — Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 — Inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data and require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
The following table summarizes the fair value of our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 (in thousands):

Fair value guidance requires certain fair value disclosures to be presented in both interim and annual reports. The estimated fair value amounts of financial instruments have been determined using available market information and valuation methodologies described below.
Cash and cash equivalents 
– Cash and cash equivalents, primarily funds held in money market savings instruments, are reported at their current carrying value, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments and are included in cash and cash equivalents in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Short-term investments 
– Short-term investments include time deposits with original maturities of three months or more.
Rabbi trust assets and deferred compensation 
– We hold investments in an irrevocable rabbi trust for our deferred compensation plan. The assets are primarily related to company-owned life insurance policies and are included in other assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Because the mutual funds and company-owned life insurance policies are combined in the plan, they are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy. The deferred compensation liability represents the investment options that the plan participants have designated to serve as the basis for measurement of the notional value of their accounts. Because the deferred compensation liability is intended to offset the plan assets, it is also categorized as Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy.
There were no transfers between levels within the fair value measurement hierarchy during the year ended September 30, 2024.

Leases
Our leases consist primarily of office space and construction equipment. All of our future lease obligations are related to non-cancelable operating leases.

 Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We have established and maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a–15(e) and 15d–15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have each concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a–15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our system of internal control was designed using a top-down risk-based approach to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures.
Management of the Company has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. Management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on management’s evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024, based on criteria in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited and issued their attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, which appears in their report on the financial statements included herein.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
