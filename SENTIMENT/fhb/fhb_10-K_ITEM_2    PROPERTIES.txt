Our corporate headquarters and main branch are located at 999 Bishop Street, Honolulu, Hawaii 96813. Inclusive of our main branch, we operated 48 branch offices located on the islands of Oahu, Maui, Hawaii, Kauai, Guam and Saipan as of December 31, 2024. We lease 29 of our branch offices and own the remainder of our offices, including our corporate headquarters and main branch which is located in the First Hawaiian Center. We believe our current facilities are adequate to meet our needs; however, we have closed and may close branches in certain circumstances.
