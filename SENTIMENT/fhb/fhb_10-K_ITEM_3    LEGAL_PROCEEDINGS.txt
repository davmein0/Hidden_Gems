Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the documents incorporated by reference herein, contains, and from time to time our management may make, forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  These forward-looking statements reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events and our financial performance. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “might,” “should,” “could,” “predict,” “potential,” “believe,” “expect,” “continue,” “will,” “anticipate,” “seek,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “projection,” “would,” “annualized” and “outlook,” or the negative version of those words or other comparable words or phrases of a future or forward-looking nature. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about our industry, management's beliefs and certain assumptions made by management, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. Accordingly, we caution you that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, assumptions, estimates and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable as of the date made, actual results may prove to be materially different from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.

A number of important factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements, including the following: the geographic concentration of our business; current and future market and economic conditions generally or in Hawaii, Guam and Saipan in particular, including inflationary pressures and interest rate environment; our dependence on the real estate markets in which we operate; concentrated exposures to certain asset classes and individual obligors; the effect of changes in interest rates on our business, including our net interest income, net interest margin, the fair value of our investment securities, and our mortgage loan originations, mortgage servicing rights and mortgage loans held for sale; the future value of the investment securities that we own; the possibility of a deterioration in credit quality in our portfolio; the possibility we might underestimate the credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio; our ability to attract and retain customer deposits; our inability to receive dividends from our Bank, pay dividends to our common stockholders and satisfy obligations as they become due; our access to sources of liquidity and capital to address our liquidity needs; our ability to attract and retain skilled employees or changes in our management personnel; our ability to maintain our Bank's reputation; the failure to properly use and protect our customer and employee information and data; the possibility of employee misconduct or mistakes; the actual or perceived soundness of other financial institutions; the effectiveness of our risk management and internal disclosure controls and procedures; our ability to keep pace with technological changes; any failure or interruption of our information and communications systems; our ability to effectively compete with other financial services companies and the effects of competition in the financial services industry on our business; our ability to identify and address cybersecurity risks; the occurrence of fraudulent activity or effect of a material breach of, or disruption to, the security of any of our or our vendors’ systems; our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new or enhanced products and services; changes in the demand for our products and services; risks associated with the sale of loans and with our use of appraisals in valuing and monitoring loans; the possibility that actual results may differ from estimates and forecasts; fluctuations in the fair value of our assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet exposures; the effects of the failure of any component of our business infrastructure provided by a third party; the potential for environmental liability; the risk of being subject to litigation and the outcome thereof; the impact of, and changes in, applicable laws, regulations and accounting standards and policies; possible changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of, and other activities undertaken by, governments, agencies, central banks and similar organizations, including as a result of changes following the recent U.S. election; the effects of severe weather, geopolitical instability, including war, terrorist attacks, pandemics or other severe health emergencies and natural disasters and other external events; the potential impact of climate change; our ability to maintain consistent growth, earnings and profitability; the impact of any pandemic, epidemic or health-related crisis; our likelihood of success in, and the impact of, litigation or regulatory actions; our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common stock; contingent liabilities and unexpected tax liabilities that may be applicable to us as a result of the Reorganization Transactions; and damage to our reputation from any of the factors described above.
