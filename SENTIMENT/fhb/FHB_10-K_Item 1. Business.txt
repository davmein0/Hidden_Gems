Non-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions against us.
​
The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Bank Secrecy Act require financial institutions to design and implement programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with FinCEN. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Federal and state bank regulators also have focused heavily on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations in recent years. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches, significant reputational harm and increased exposure to civil litigation. In recent years, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations, and, in some cases, governmental authorities have required as part of settlements criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms, including admissions of wrongdoing and the impositions of monitors. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, these policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
​
Regulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities.
​
We are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification, and we could be negatively impacted by these laws. For example, our business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share nonpublic personal information about our customers with nonaffiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to customers about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford customers the right to “opt out” of any information sharing by us with nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions) and (iii) requires that we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards appropriate based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of customer information we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal banking regulators and states have also proposed or enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Moreover, legislators and regulators in the United States are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. As new privacy-related laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and any future laws and regulations which will be modeled after those laws, are implemented, the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as our potential liability for non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase. This could result from, among other things, increased privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level, by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as at the state level, such as with regard to mobile applications.
​
Compliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws (including those regarding security breach notification) to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Differences in regulation can affect our ability to compete effectively.
​
The content and application of laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions vary according to the size of the institution, the jurisdictions in which the institution is organized and operates and other factors. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are, and, as a result, may be able to compete more effectively for business. In particular, the activity of private creditors and other financial technology companies (“fintechs”) has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow. Fintechs have and may continue to offer bank or bank-like products. For example, a number of fintechs have applied for, and in some cases received, bank or industrial loan charters. In addition, other fintechs have partnered with existing banks to allow them to offer deposit products to their customers. Regulatory changes may also make it easier for fintechs to partner with banks and offer deposit products. Other regulation has reduced the regulatory burden of large bank holding companies, and raised the asset thresholds at which more onerous requirements apply, which could cause certain large bank holding companies with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets, which were previously subject to more stringent enhanced prudential standards, to become more competitive or to pursue expansion more aggressively. There is also increased competition by out-of-market competitors through online and mobile channels. In addition, the emergence, adoption and evolution of new technologies that do not require intermediation, including distributed ledgers, as well as advances in automation, could significantly affect competition for financial services. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area.
​
Our use of third-party vendors and our other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.
​
We regularly use third-party vendors as part of our business. We also have substantial ongoing business relationships with other third parties. These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by our federal bank regulators, as well as heightened supervisory expectations regarding our due diligence, ongoing monitoring and control over our third-party vendors and other ongoing third-party business relationships. In certain cases, we may be required to renegotiate our agreements with these vendors to meet these enhanced requirements, which could increase our costs. We expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for deficiencies in our oversight and control of our third-party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which we have these relationships. As a result, if our regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our third-party vendors or other ongoing third-party business relationships or that such third parties have not performed appropriately, we could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
​
We are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our bank branches and any real estate collateral we acquire upon foreclosure.
​
During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans that we have originated or acquired. We also have an extensive branch network, owning separate branch locations throughout the areas we serve. For any real property that we may possess, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage and costs of complying with applicable environmental regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with such requirements can result in penalties. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property’s value or limit our ability to use, sell or lease the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

We may be subject to litigation risk pertaining to our fiduciary responsibilities.
​
Some of the services we provide, such as trust and investment services, require us to act as fiduciaries for our customers and others. From time to time, third parties make claims and take legal action against us pertaining to the performance of our fiduciary responsibilities. If these claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, we may be exposed to significant financial liability or our reputation could be damaged. Either of these results may adversely impact demand for our products and services or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
​
Other Risks Affecting Our Business
.   
​
Severe weather, hurricanes, tsunamis, natural disasters, pandemics, acts of war or terrorism or other external events could significantly impact our business.
​
Severe weather, hurricanes, tsunamis, natural disasters, widespread disease or pandemics or other severe health emergencies, or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency, acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our business. Additionally, financial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of global wars or military conflicts, terrorism or other geopolitical events. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Furthermore, the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, extreme weather and natural disasters may lead to population dislocations, adversely affect the livelihood of our customers and/or borrowers or otherwise cause significant economic dislocation in the affected areas. Because Hawaii’s economy is heavily dependent on the tourism industry, which is in turn heavily influenced by the affordability and desirability of air travel, any related safety concerns or limitations  and the prevailing weather patterns in the region, we could be disproportionately affected relative to others in the case of external events such as acts of war or terrorism, severe weather, natural disasters or pandemics or other actual or perceived severe health emergencies, including travel restrictions as a result of actual or perceived health emergencies that impact markets on which we depend. The occurrence of any of these events in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
​
We own the building in Honolulu in which our principal office and headquarters are located. Given that we derive a portion of our income from leasing space in our principal office building and that a large concentration of our employees is located in our principal office building, depending on the intensity and longevity of the event, a catastrophic event impacting our Honolulu office building, including a terrorist attack, extreme weather event or other hostile or catastrophic event, could negatively affect our business and reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
​
Climate change could have a material negative impact on us and our customers.
​
Our business, as well as the operations and activities of our customers, could be negatively impacted by climate change. Climate change presents both immediate and long-term risks to us and our customers and these risks are expected to increase over time. Climate change presents multi-faceted risks, including (i) operational risk from the physical effects of climate events on our facilities and other assets as well as those of our customers; (ii) credit risk from borrowers with significant exposure to climate risk; (iii) legal, regulatory and compliance risks arising from the policy, legal and regulatory changes associated with the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy; and (iv) reputational risk from stakeholder concerns about our practices related to climate change, our carbon footprint and our decision to change or continue to maintain our business relationships with customers who operate in carbon-intensive industries, and from negative public opinion related to any of our actions or inaction in response to climate change and our climate change strategy.
​

For instance, climate change exposes us and our customers to physical risk as its effects may lead to more frequent and more extreme weather events, such as prolonged droughts or flooding, tornados, hurricanes, wildfires and extreme seasonal weather; and longer-term shifts, such as increasing average temperatures, ozone depletion and rising sea levels. As our primary markets are located on islands in the Pacific Ocean, they may be particularly susceptible to certain of these risks or other risks resulting from climate change, including those relating to rising sea levels. Such events and long-term shifts may result in destruction or impairment of properties, disruptions to business operations, or reduced availability or increased price of insurance and may have a significant impact on our customers, which could amplify credit risk by diminishing borrowers’ repayment capacity or collateral values, and other businesses and counterparties with whom we transact, which could have a broader impact on the economy, supply chains and distribution networks. Furthermore, we would be exposed to a great deal of uncertainty when recovering from such events, including the time it will take to rebuild physically and economically and the amounts of insurance coverage or government assistance available to our affected customers.
​
Climate change may also result in new and/or more stringent regulatory requirements for the Company, which could materially affect the Company’s results of operations by requiring the Company to take costly measures to comply with any new laws or regulations related to climate change that may be forthcoming. Ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding, climate risk management and practices may also subject us to different and potentially conflicting requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. New regulations or guidance, or the attitudes of regulators, shareholders and employees regarding climate change, may affect the activities in which the Company engages and the products that the Company offers. In addition, an increasing perspective that financial institutions, including the Company, play an important role in managing risks related to climate change, including indirectly with respect to their customers, may result in increased pressure on the Company to take additional steps to disclose and manage its climate risks and related lending and other activities. Risks associated with climate change are continuing to evolve rapidly, making it difficult to assess the effects of climate change on the Company, and the Company expects that climate change-related risks will continue to evolve and increase over time. If our actual or perceived action or inaction in response to these climate change-related risks are, or are perceived to be, ineffective or insufficient, or if we participate in, or decide not to participate in, certain industries or activities perceived to be associated with causing or exacerbating climate change, we could be subject to enforcement and other supervisory or government actions, reputational damage, a loss of customer or investor confidence, difficulty retaining or attracting talented employees, or other harm.  
​
We may be subject to unexpected income tax liabilities in connection with the Reorganization Transactions. BWHI is required to pay us for any unexpected income tax liabilities that arise in connection with the Reorganization Transactions. However, in the event that BWHI does not satisfy its payment obligations, we could be subject to significantly higher federal and/or state and local income tax liabilities than currently anticipated.
​
BNPP, BWHI and we expect that no U.S. federal income taxes will be imposed on us in connection with the Reorganization Transactions. However, we paid state and local income taxes of approximately $95.4 million in June 2016 (which was partially offset by a federal tax reduction of approximately $33.4 million received through the intercompany settlement of estimated taxes in April 2017) in connection with the Reorganization Transactions (the “Expected Taxes”). BNPP, BWHI and we reported a total tax liability in connection with the Reorganization Transactions of $92.1 million (the “Return Taxes”) in the tax returns of various state and local jurisdictions. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we reimbursed BWHI approximately $2.1 million due to the Return Taxes being lower than the Expected Taxes. Such amount was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. We could be subject to higher income tax liabilities in the event that the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) or state and local tax authorities successfully assert that our income tax liabilities in respect of the Reorganization Transactions are higher than the Return Taxes. Under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, BWHI is required to pay us for any such additional taxes on an “after-tax basis” (which means an amount determined by reducing the payment amount by any tax benefits derived by the Company and increasing the payment amount by any tax costs, including additional taxes, incurred by the Company as a result of such additional taxes and/or payments). See “Certain Related Party Transactions” in the Company’s Proxy Statement, which is incorporated herein by reference. If, however, our income tax liabilities with respect to the Reorganization Transactions are higher than the Return Taxes and BWHI fails to satisfy its payment obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we could be liable for significantly higher federal and/or state income tax liabilities. We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS or state and local tax authorities regarding our expected tax treatment of the Reorganization Transactions.

In addition, under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and related rules and regulations, each entity that was a member of the BancWest combined tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the Reorganization Transactions is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire combined tax reporting group for such taxable period. Although the Tax Sharing Agreement allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the combined tax reporting group in accordance with the existing tax allocation agreements, if BWHI were unable to pay any such prior period taxes for which it is responsible, we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes, and such amounts could be significant. Other provisions of federal, state or local tax law may establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities.
​
Risks Related to Our Common Stock
​
Our stock price may be volatile, and you could lose part or all of your investment as a result.
​
Stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. Our stock price may fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:
​
●
Actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations;
​
●
Recommendations or research reports about us or the financial services industry in general published by securities analysts;
​
●
The failure of securities analysts to cover, or continue to cover, us;
​
●
Operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;
​
●
News reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry;
​
●
Future sales of our common stock;
​
●
Departure of our management team or other key personnel;
​
●
New technology used, or services offered, by competitors;
​
●
Significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;
​
●
Changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations, or differing interpretations thereof affecting our business, or enforcement of these laws and regulations;
​
●
Litigation and governmental investigations; and
​
●
Geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts and government shutdowns.
​
If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to litigation that, even if our defense is successful, could distract our management and be costly to defend. General market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events — such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends — could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.

Future sales and issuances of our common stock, including sales as part of our equity-based compensation plans, could result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could lower our stock price.
​
The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock or from the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling equity securities in the future, at a time and price that we deem appropriate. As of February 14, 2025 we had a total of 126,422,898 shares of common stock outstanding.
​
We have filed a registration statement to register 6,253,385 shares of our common stock for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans. In April 2021, our stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of the First Hawaiian, Inc. 2016 Non-Employee Director Plan principally to increase the total number of shares of common stock that may be awarded under that plan by 193,941 shares. We have granted awards covering 4,063,680 shares of our common stock under these plans as of December 31, 2024. We may increase the number of shares registered for this purpose from time to time, subject to stockholder approval. Once we register and issue these shares, their holders will be able to sell them in the public market, subject to applicable transfer restrictions.
​
We cannot predict the size of future issuances or sales of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances or sales of shares of our common stock may have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.
​
Certain banking laws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have an anti-takeover effect.
​
Provisions of federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our stockholders. Acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company or depository institution, including shares of our common stock, generally creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer “controls” the bank holding company or depository institution. Also, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before, among other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank, including our bank.
​
There also are provisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which we refer to as our certificate of incorporation, and fourth amended and restated bylaws, which we refer to as our bylaws, such as limitations on the ability to call a special meeting of our stockholders and restrictions on stockholders’ ability to act by written consent, that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. In addition, our board of directors is authorized under our certificate of incorporation to issue shares of our preferred stock, and determine the rights, terms conditions and privileges of such preferred stock, without stockholder approval. These provisions may effectively inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.

Managing Material Risks and 
Integrated
 Overall Risk Management 
​
The Company has implemented a risk-based approach to identify and assess the cybersecurity threats that could affect our business and information systems. Our cybersecurity program is designed to align with industry standards and best practices, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework. We use various tools and methodologies to manage cybersecurity risk that are tested on a regular cadence. We also monitor and evaluate our cybersecurity posture and performance on an ongoing basis through regular vulnerability scans, third-party conducted penetration tests and network monitoring. We also provide security awareness training for employees and contractors, maintain a cybersecurity insurance policy and invest in new security capabilities designed to address emerging threats.  
​
In addition, the Company has a set of enterprise-wide policies, standards, and procedures concerning cybersecurity matters, which include an information security policy and program reviewed and approved by senior management and the Board of Directors. Additionally, technical standards and procedures related to incident response and use of Bank systems and devices are in place, as well as standards for critical security operational functions related to encryption, endpoint protection, vulnerability management, remote access, multifactor authentication, handling confidential information, use of internet, social media, email, and wireless devices. Policies and standards are subject to an internal review process and are approved by senior management.
​
The Company has strategically integrated cybersecurity risk management into our enterprise-wide risk management framework in alignment with the three lines of defense model to promote an enterprise-wide culture of cybersecurity risk management. This integration aims to provide that cybersecurity considerations are an integral part of our decision-making processes at every level. Our risk management team works closely with our enterprise technology and cybersecurity management teams to evaluate and address cybersecurity risks in alignment with our business objectives, regulatory requirements and operational needs. 
​
Engaging Third Parties on Risk Management 
​
Recognizing the complexity and evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, 
the Company engages with a range of external experts, including cybersecurity service providers, assessors, advisors and consultants, in evaluating and testing our cybersecurity program
. These partnerships enable us to leverage specialized knowledge and insights to ensure our cybersecurity strategies and processes are aligned to industry best practices. Our collaboration with these third parties includes threat assessments and consultation on security improvements, program maturity and regulatory compliance.  Additionally, we conduct multiple penetration tests annually and retain an external consultant to periodically evaluate the overall state of our program.
​
Overseeing Third-Party Risk 
​
The 
Company has processes in place to oversee and manage risks associated with third-party service providers
, including risks related to data breaches or other security incidents. This includes conducting security due diligence reviews of critical third-party providers, subjecting third parties to periodic risk assessments and requiring third parties to sign standard contractual provisions before receiving sensitive information from the Company. 
​
Risks from Cybersecurity Threats 
​
Like all financial institutions, we, as well as our third-party service providers, are the target of various evolving and adaptive security threats, including malware, ransomware, phishing, credential validation and distributed denial-of-service attacks. Cyber-attacks have also focused on targeting online applications and services, such as online banking, as well as cloud-based and other products and services provided by third parties. Operational failures and breaches of security from such attempts could lead to the loss or disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to the Company or our employees and customers. These failures and breaches could result in business interruption or malfunction and lead to legal or regulatory actions that could result in a 
material adverse
 impact on the Company’s operations, reputation and financial results.
