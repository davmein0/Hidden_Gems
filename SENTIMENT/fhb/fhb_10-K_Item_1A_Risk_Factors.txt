Return on average tangible assets, return on average tangible stockholders’ equity, tangible book value per share and tangible stockholders’ equity to tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures. We compute our return on average tangible assets as the ratio of net income to average tangible assets. We compute our return on average tangible stockholders’ equity as the ratio of net income to average tangible stockholders’ equity. We compute our tangible book value per share as the ratio of tangible stockholders’ equity to outstanding shares. We compute our tangible stockholders’ equity to tangible assets as the ratio of tangible stockholders’ equity to tangible assets. We believe that these financial measures are useful for investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate financial performance and capital adequacy relative to other financial institutions. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by shareholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.

Financial Highlights
​
Net income was $230.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $4.9 million or 2% as compared to 2023. Basic earnings per share was $1.80 for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $0.04 or 2% as compared to 2023. Diluted earnings per share was $1.79 for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $0.05 or 3% as compared to 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a $15.0 million decrease in noninterest income and a $13.4 million decrease in net interest income. This was partially offset by an $11.9 million decrease in the provision for credit losses (the “Provision”) and an $11.7 million decrease in the provision for income taxes.
​

Table of Contents
Net income was $235.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $30.7 million or 12% as compared to 2022. Basic and diluted earnings per share were both $1.84 for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $0.24 or 12% as compared to 2022. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a $60.7 million increase in noninterest expense and a $25.2 million increase in the Provision. This was partially offset by a $22.6 million increase in net interest income, a $21.3 million increase in noninterest income and an $11.3 million decrease in the provision for income taxes.
​
Our return on average total assets was 0.96% for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of one basis point as compared to 2023, and our return on average total stockholders’ equity was 9.00% for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of 101 basis points as compared to 2023. Our return on average tangible assets was 1.00% for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of one basis point as compared to 2023, and our return on average tangible stockholders’ equity was 14.74% for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of 265 basis points as compared to 2023, due to an increase in average stockholders’ equity, which resulted in part from a decrease in net unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio, and lower net income. Our efficiency ratio was 61.57% for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to 59.48% in 2023. Return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible stockholders’ equity are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible stockholders’ equity, see Table 2, GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation.
​
Our return on average total assets was 0.95% for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 11 basis points as compared to 2022, and our return on average total stockholders’ equity was 10.01% for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 143 basis points as compared to 2022. Our return on average tangible assets was 0.99% for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 12 basis points as compared to 2022, and our return on average tangible stockholders’ equity was 17.39% for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 264 basis points as compared to 2022. Our efficiency ratio was 59.48% for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 55.20% in 2022. Return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible stockholders’ equity are non-GAAP financial measures. For a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for return on average tangible assets and return on average tangible stockholders’ equity, see Table 2, GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation.
​
Our results for the December 31, 2024 were highlighted by the following:
​
●
Net interest income was $622.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $13.4 million or 2% as compared to 2023. Our net interest margin was 2.95% for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of three basis points as compared to 2023. The decrease in net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis was primarily due to higher deposit funding costs and lower average balances in our investment securities portfolio, partially offset by higher rates on our earning assets driven by higher yields in our loan and lease portfolio, higher average balances on our interest-bearing deposits in other banks and lower borrowing costs.
​
●
The Provision was $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $11.9 million as compared to 2023. The decrease in the Provision was primarily due to decreases in the provision for construction loans, commercial real estate loans and home equity lines and the provision for unfunded commercial and industrial, construction, home equity line and commercial real estate commitments. This was partially offset by increases in the provision for consumer loans, commercial and industrial loans and residential mortgage loans. The Provision is recorded to maintain the ACL and the reserve for unfunded commitments at levels deemed adequate to absorb lifetime expected credit losses in our loan and lease portfolio and unfunded loan and lease commitments as of the balance sheet date.
​
●
Noninterest income was $185.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $15.0 million or 7% as compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a $26.2 million net loss on the sale of investment securities and a $1.0 million decrease in other noninterest income, partially offset by a $8.6 million increase in other services charges and fees, a $2.5 million increase in bank-owned life insurance (“BOLI”) income and a $1.4 million increase in service charges on deposits accounts.
​
54

Table of Contents
●
Noninterest expense was $501.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $0.1 million as compared to 2023. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to a $9.8 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $8.8 million increase in equipment expense and a $2.2 million increase in card rewards program expense. This was partially offset by a $13.0 million decrease in regulatory assessment and fees, a $5.5 million decrease in contracted services and professional fees, a $1.7 million decrease in other noninterest expense and a $0.6 million decrease in occupancy expense.
​
Our results for the December 31, 2023 were highlighted by the following:
​
●
Net interest income was $636.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $22.6 million or 4% as compared to 2022. Our net interest margin was 2.92% for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 14 basis points as compared to 2022. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher yields and average balances in our loan and lease portfolio and higher yields on interest-bearing deposits in other banks, primarily attributable to the rising interest rate environment in the period. This was partially offset by higher deposit funding costs and higher borrowing costs.
​
●
The Provision was $26.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $25.2 million as compared to 2022. The Provision of $26.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, was primarily due to increases in the provision for consumer loans, construction loans, commercial and industrial loans, residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate loans and the provision for unfunded commercial and industrial and construction commitments. This was partially offset by a decrease in the provision for unfunded home equity line commitments. The Provision is recorded to maintain the ACL and the reserve for unfunded commitments at levels deemed adequate to absorb lifetime expected credit losses in our loan and lease portfolio and unfunded loan and lease commitments as of the balance sheet date.
​
●
Noninterest income was $200.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $21.3 million or 12% as compared to 2022. The increase was primarily due to a $14.1 million increase in  BOLI income, a $5.5 million increase in other noninterest income, a $2.0 million increase in trust and investment services income, a $0.8 million increase in service charges on deposits accounts and a $0.8 million increase in net gains on the sale of investment securities, partially offset by a $2.1 million decrease in credit and debit card fees.
​
●
Noninterest expense was $501.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $60.7 million or 14% as compared to 2022. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to a $26.6 million increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $22.5 million increase in regulatory assessment and fees, a $10.6 million increase in equipment expense and a $5.7 million increase in other noninterest expense. This was partially offset by a $3.6 million decrease in contracted services and professional fees and a $1.4 million decrease in occupancy expense.
​
Balance sheet highlights consisted of the following:
​
●
Total loans and leases were $14.4 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $54.8 million as compared to December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to increases in commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, lease financing, and construction loans, partially offset by decreases in residential real estate loans and consumer loans.
​
●
The ACL was $160.4 million as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $3.9 million or 2% from December 31, 2023. The ratio of our ACL to total loans and leases outstanding was 1.11% as of December 31, 2024, an increase of two basis points compared to December 31, 2023. The overall level of the ACL was commensurate with our stable credit risk profile, loan portfolio growth and composition and a stable Hawaii economy.

●
Our investment portfolio is comprised of high-grade investment securities, primarily collateralized mortgage obligations issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”), the Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) and mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Municipal Housing Authorities and non-agency entities. The total carrying value of our investment securities portfolio was $5.7 billion as of December 31, 2024, a decrease of $579.6 million or 9% from December 31, 2023. The lower balances in investment securities were driven by payments and maturities during the year ended December 31, 2024, which were used to fund loan growth and offset a decline in deposits and borrowings. Additionally, a restructuring of the available-for-sale investment portfolio was conducted in the fourth quarter of 2024, whereby sales and purchases were conducted to improve the return of the investment portfolio.
​
●
Total deposits were $20.3 billion as of December 31, 2024, a decrease of $1.0 billion or 5% from December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a $608.4 million decrease in demand deposit balances, a $423.7 million decrease in savings deposit balances and a $157.8 million decrease in time deposit balances, partially offset by a $179.5 million increase in money market deposit balances.
​
●
Total borrowings consisted of $250.0 million of short-term borrowings as of December 31, 2024, a decrease of $250.0 million or 50% from December 31, 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, $500.0 million of Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances matured and a new $250.0 million short-term FHLB advance was taken. For information with respect to the financial terms of such advances, see “ – Analysis of Financial Condition – Short-term Borrowings.”
​
●
Total stockholders’ equity was $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $131.4 million or 5% from December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily due to earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024 of $230.1 million and other comprehensive income, net of tax, of $66.2 million, primarily due to changes in our investment securities portfolio, partially offset by dividends declared and paid to the Company’s stockholders of $132.8 million and common stock repurchased of $40.0 million.

The change in interest income and expense not solely due to changes in volume or rate has been allocated on a pro-rata basis to the volume and rate columns.
​
Net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was $628.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $13.5 million or 2% as compared to 2023. Our net interest margin was 2.95% for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of three basis points as compared to 2023. The decrease in net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was primarily due to higher deposit funding costs and lower average balances in our investment securities portfolio. This was partially offset by higher rates on our earning assets driven by higher yields in our loan and lease portfolio, higher average balances on our interest-bearing deposits in other banks and lower borrowing costs. Deposit funding costs were $335.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $77.5 million or 30% compared to 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest rates. Rates paid on our interest-bearing deposits were 251 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of 53 basis points compared to 2023, primarily due to rate increases. For the year ended December 31, 2024, average balances on our investment securities portfolio was $6.0 billion, a decrease of $1.1 billion or 15% compared to 2023, primarily due to payments, maturities and restructuring of securities during the period. Yields on our loans and leases were 5.65% for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of 39 basis points as compared to 2023, driven by higher average yields on our adjustable-rate loans, runoff of lower fixed-rate loans and higher rates on new loan originations during the period. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the average balance of our interest-bearing deposits in other banks was $900.8 million, an increase of $388.5 million or 76% compared to the same period in 2023. Total borrowing costs were $20.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $6.3 million or 24% compared to 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, $500.0 million of FHLB advances matured and a new $250.0 million short-term FHLB advance was taken.

Net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was $641.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $23.3 million or 4% as compared to 2022. Our net interest margin was 2.92% for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 14 basis points as compared to 2022. The increase in net interest income, on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, was driven by the rising interest rate environment and was primarily due to higher yields and average balances in our loan and lease portfolio and higher yields on our interest-bearing deposits in other banks. This was partially offset by higher deposit funding cost and higher borrowing costs. Yields on our loans and leases were 5.26% for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 142 basis points as compared to 2022. We experienced an increase in our yields from total loans and leases primarily due to increases in yields from our adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans and construction loans, which are largely based on the SOFR. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the average balance of our loan and lease portfolio was $14.3 billion, an increase of $951.5 million or 7% compared to the same period in 2022. The increase in the average balance of our loans and leases reflected increases in most loan categories. Yields on our interest-bearing deposits in other banks were 5.18% for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 399 basis points compared to 2022. Deposit funding costs were $258.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $209.0 million compared to 2022. Rates paid on our interest-bearing deposits were 198 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 159 basis points compared to 2022. Total borrowing costs were $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $25.8 million compared to 2022, primarily due to the FHLB repo advances and FHLB fixed-rate advances that originated during 2023.  
​
The Federal Reserve influences the general market rates of interest, including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions. Our loan portfolio is affected by changes in the prime interest rate. The prime rate began in 2022 at 3.25% and increased a total of 425 basis points (25 basis points in March, 50 basis points in May, 75 basis points in each month of June, July, September and November, and 50 basis points in December) to end the year at 7.50%. During 2023, the prime rate increased 100 basis points (25 basis points each in February, March, May and July) to end the year at 8.50%. In 2024, the prime rate decreased 100 basis points (50 basis points in September, and 25 basis points in both November and December) to end the year at 7.50%. Our loan portfolio is also impacted by changes in the SOFR. At December 31, 2024, the one-month and three-month CME Term SOFR interest rates were 4.33% and 4.31%, respectively. At December 31, 2023, the one-month and three-month CME Term SOFR interest rates were 5.35% and 5.33%, respectively. At December 31, 2022, the one-month and three-month CME Term SOFR interest rates were 4.36% and 4.59%, respectively. The target range for the federal funds rate, which is the cost of immediately available overnight funds, began in 2022 at 0.00% to 0.25%, and increased a total of 425 basis points to end the year at 4.25% to 4.50%. During 2023, the federal funds rate increased 100 basis points to end the year at 5.25% to 5.50%. In 2024, the federal funds rate decreased 100 basis points to end the year at 4.25% to 4.50%. There continues to be uncertainty in the changing market and economic conditions, including the possibility of additional measures that could be taken by the Federal Reserve and other government agencies related to the overall macroeconomic environment.
​
Provision for Credit Losses
​
The Provision was $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to a Provision of $26.6 million in 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Provision included $17.5 million in provision for credit losses for loans and leases, compared to $24.9 million in provision for credit losses for loans and leases in 2023, and a negative $2.8 million in provision for credit losses for the reserve for unfunded commitments, compared to $1.8 million in provision for credit losses for the reserve for unfunded commitments in 2023. The Provision of $14.8 million was primarily due to decreases in the provision for construction loans, commercial real estate loans and home equity lines and the provision for unfunded commercial and industrial, construction, home equity line and commercial real estate commitments. This was partially offset by increases in the provision for consumer loans, commercial and industrial loans and residential mortgage loans. We recorded net charge-offs of $13.6 million and $12.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This represented net charge-offs of 0.10% and 0.09% of total average loans and leases for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The ACL was $160.4 million and $156.5 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and represented 1.11% of total outstanding loans and leases as of December 31, 2024, compared to 1.09% of total outstanding loans and leases as of December 31, 2023. The reserve for unfunded commitments was $32.8 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to $35.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The Provision is recorded to maintain the ACL and the reserve for unfunded commitments at levels deemed adequate by management based on the factors noted in the “Risk Governance and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Credit Risk” section of this MD&A.

This was partially offset by 
a $1.1 million decrease in other compensation, primarily related to a decrease in nonrecurring separation agreements and severance costs, partially offset by adjustments made to the deferred compensation plan as a result of market conditions,
 a $0.9 million decrease in employee overtime pay expense, a $0.9 million decrease in state unemployment tax expense and a $0.6 million decrease in temporary help expenses.

​
Contracted services and professional fees were $60.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $5.5 million or 8% as compared to 2023.

​
Occupancy expense was $29.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $0.6 million or 2% as compared to 2023. This decrease was due to a $0.5 million increase in net sublease rental income and a $0.3 million decrease in building depreciation, partially offset by a $0.4 million increase in lease-related insurance expense. Occupancy expense was $29.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $1.4 million or 5% as compared to 2022. This decrease was due to a $0.9 million decrease in building depreciation, a $0.7 million decrease in building maintenance expense and a $0.5 million decrease in utilities expense, partially offset by a $0.8 million decrease in net sublease rental income.
​
Equipment expense was $53.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $8.8 million or 19% as compared to 2023. This increase was primarily due to an $8.0 million increase in technology-related amortization and licensing and maintenance fees, a $0.5 million increase in furniture and equipment depreciation and a $0.3 million increase in other furniture and equipment expense. Equipment expense was $45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $10.6 million or 31% as compared to 2022. This increase was primarily due to an $11.8 million increase in technology-related amortization and licensing and maintenance fees, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in furniture and equipment depreciation.
​
Regulatory assessment and fees were $19.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $13.0 million or 40% as compared to 2023. Regulatory assessment and fees were $32.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $22.5 million as compared to 2022. In October 2022, the FDIC adopted a final rule to increase the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules by 2 basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. In May 2023, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for a special assessment to replenish the deposit insurance fund following the 2023 bank failures. In November 2023, the FDIC approved a final rule to implement the special assessment and we recorded a $16.3 million expense in December 2023. 
During the first quarter of 2024, the FDIC issued a notice that the original loss estimate related to the 2023 bank failures was subsequently increased and that this increase would result in an additional assessment expense to affected institutions. As a result, we recorded a net expense related to the special assessment of $3.5 million for year ended December 31, 2024.
​
Advertising and marketing expense was $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $0.1 million or 1% as compared to 2023. Advertising and marketing expense was $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $0.4 million or 5% as compared to 2022.

Card rewards program expense was $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $2.2 million or 7% as compared to 2023. This increase was primarily due to a $1.6 million increase in credit card cash reward redemptions and a $1.6 million increase in interchange fees paid to our credit card partners, partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in priority rewards card redemptions and a $0.3 million decrease in international transaction fees. Card rewards program expense was $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $0.6 million or 2% as compared to 2022. This increase was primarily due to a $2.1 million increase in credit card cash reward redemptions and a $1.2 million increase in interchange fees paid to our credit card partners, partially offset by a $2.5 million decrease in priority rewards card redemptions.
​
Other noninterest expense was $61.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of $1.7 million or 3% as compared to 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a $3.3 million decrease in operational losses and other charge-offs, a $2.1 million decrease in charitable contributions, a $1.0 million decrease in pension-related expenses, a $0.8 million decrease in losses incurred due to natural disasters and a $0.6 million decrease in business privilege tax expense. This was partially offset by a $3.8 million increase in expense due to adjustments to certain liabilities assumed as a result of the Reorganization Transactions, a $1.0 million increase in brokers fees, a $0.6 million increase in costs associated with a fund acquired by the Company and a $0.6 million increase in other tax expense. Other noninterest expense was $62.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $5.7 million or 10% as compared to 2022. This increase was primarily due to a one-time settlement expense in connection to a lawsuit against the Company, a $2.7 million increase in charitable contributions and increases in postage expenses, signature-based card fraud expenses and travel expenses. This was partially offset by a $1.4 million decrease in pension-related expenses, and decreases in activity charges assessed on the Company’s bank accounts, general and administrative expenses primarily around supplies, insurance, meals and entertainment and shipping and delivery, software amortization expense, mortgage loan charges and other tax expense.

Net income for the Retail Banking segment was $238.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $55.4 million or 30% as compared to 2023. The increase in net income for the Retail Banking segment was primarily due to a $48.7 million increase in net interest income, a $9.2 million decrease in noninterest expense, a $8.4 million increase in noninterest income and a $1.6 million decrease in the Provision, partially offset by a $12.4 million increase in the provision for income taxes. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher deposit and loan spreads.  The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to lower overall expenses that were allocated to the Retail Banking segment and a decrease in regulatory assessments and fees, partially offset by increases in salaries and employee benefits expense and brokers fees. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to increases in other services charges and fees and service charges on deposit accounts. The decrease in the Provision was primarily due to a decrease in our provision for credit losses for loans and leases allocated to the Retail Banking segment. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the increase in pretax income. The decrease in total earning assets for the Retail Banking segment was primarily due to a decrease in our residential real estate loan portfolio.
​
Net income for the Retail Banking segment was $183.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $3.4 million or 2% as compared to 2022. The increase in net income for the Retail Banking segment was primarily due to a $21.9 million increase in net interest income and a $3.6 million increase in noninterest income.

The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher deposit spreads, partially offset by lower loan spreads. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to increases in trust and investment services income, net mortgage servicing rights income and service charges on deposit accounts. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits expense, regulatory assessments and fees, occupancy expense and costs related to natural disaster events, partially offset by lower overall expenses that were allocated to the Retail Banking segment.

​
Commercial Banking
.  Our Commercial Banking segment includes our corporate banking related products, commercial real estate loans, commercial lease financing, secured and unsecured lines of credit, automobile loans and auto dealer financing, business deposit products and credit cards. Commercial lending and deposit products are offered primarily to middle-market and large companies locally, nationally and internationally.
​
Net income for the Commercial Banking segment was $132.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, an increase of $37.3 million or 39% as compared to 2023. The increase in net income for the Commercial Banking segment was primarily due to a $22.3 million decrease in noninterest expense, a $10.1 million increase in net interest income, a $5.8 million decrease in the Provision and a $4.1 million increase in noninterest income, partially offset by a $5.0 million increase in the provision for income taxes. The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to lower overall expenses that were allocated to the Commercial Banking segment, a one-time settlement expense in connection to a lawsuit against the Company incurred in 2023 and a decrease in regulatory assessment and fees, partially offset by an increase in card reward expenses. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher deposit spreads and average balances, partially offset by lower loan and lease spreads. The decrease in the Provision was primarily due to a decrease in our provision for credit losses for loans and leases allocated to the Commercial Banking segment. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to an excise tax refund received in 2024, in addition to increases in credit and debit card fees, other service charges and fees and service charges on deposit accounts, partially offset by a decrease in volume-based incentives. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the increase in pretax income. The increase in total earning assets for the Commercial Banking segment was primarily due to increases in our commercial real estate loan and lease financing portfolios, partially offset by a decrease in our consumer loan portfolio.

Table of Contents
Net income for the Commercial Banking segment was $95.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $0.6 million or 1% as compared to 2022. The decrease in net income for the Commercial Banking segment was primarily due to a Provision of $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a negative Provision of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, in addition to a $2.9 million increase in noninterest expense and a $2.2 million decrease in noninterest income. This was partially offset by an $18.4 million increase in net interest income and a $2.2 million decrease in the provision for income taxes. The increase in the Provision was primarily due to an increase in our provision for credit losses for loans and leases allocated to the Commercial Banking segment. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to an increase in regulatory assessment and fees, a one-time settlement expense in connection to a lawsuit against the Company mentioned previously, and increases in salaries and benefits expense and card rewards program expense, partially offset by lower overall expenses that were allocated to the Commercial Banking segment. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to a decrease in credit and debit card fees. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher loan average balances and spreads, partially offset by a decrease in loan fees. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the decrease in pretax income. The increase in total earning assets for the Commercial Banking segment was primarily due to increases in our commercial loan and lease financing portfolios, partially offset by a decrease in our consumer loan portfolio.
​
Treasury and Other.
  Our Treasury and Other segment includes our treasury business, which consists of corporate asset and liability management activities, including interest rate risk management. The assets and liabilities (and related interest income and expense) of our treasury business consist of interest-bearing deposits, investment securities, federal funds sold and purchased, government deposits, short and long-term borrowings and bank-owned properties. Our primary sources of noninterest income are from BOLI, net gains from the sale of investment securities, foreign exchange income related to customer driven cross-border wires for business and personal reasons and management of bank-owned properties in Hawaii and Guam. The net residual effect of the transfer pricing of assets and liabilities is included in Treasury and Other, along with the elimination of intercompany transactions.
​
Other organizational units (Technology, Operations, Credit and Risk Management, Human Resources, Finance, Administration, Marketing, and Corporate and Regulatory Administration) provide a wide range of support to our other income earning segments. Expenses incurred by these support units are charged to the applicable business segments through an internal cost allocation process.
​
Net loss for the Treasury and Other segment was $140.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to net loss of $43.3 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily due to a $72.2 million increase in net interest expense, a $31.5 million increase in noninterest expense and a $27.5 million decrease in noninterest income. This was partially offset by a $29.2 million increase in the benefit for income taxes and a negative Provision of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to a Provision of $1.8 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net interest expense was primarily due to an increase in net transfer pricing charges that reside in the Treasury and Other segment and a decrease in interest income from investment securities, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense from public deposits, higher interest income on our interest-bearing deposits in other banks and lower borrowing costs. The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to lower overall credits that were allocated to the Treasury and Other segment and increases in equipment expense, salaries and employee benefits expense, expense due to adjustments to certain liabilities assumed as a result of the Reorganization Transactions and operational losses and other charge-offs. This was partially offset by decreases in contracted services and professional fees and regulatory assessment and fees and charitable contributions. The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to net losses on the sale of investment securities in 2024, gain on the sale of a bank property in 2023 and a decrease in credit and debit card fees. This was partially offset by insurance proceeds received in 2024, an increase in BOLI income and a decrease in net losses recognized in income related to derivative contracts. The increase in the benefit for income taxes was primarily due to the increase in pretax loss in addition to adjustments to certain liabilities assumed as a result of the Reorganization Transactions. The decrease in the Provision was primarily due to the decrease in our provision for unfunded commitments. The decrease in total earning assets for the Treasury and Other segment was primarily due to decreases in our interest-bearing deposits in other banks and our investment securities portfolio.

The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to lower overall credits that were allocated to the Treasury and Other segment and increases in equipment expense, salaries and employee benefits expense and regulatory assessment and fees. This was partially offset by decreases in contracted services and professional fees and occupancy expense. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in interest expense from public deposits and higher borrowing costs, partially offset by an increase in net transfer pricing credits that reside in the Treasury and Other segment and higher yields on our interest-bearing deposits in other banks. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to increases in BOLI income, a gain on the sale of a bank property in 2023 mentioned previously, market adjustments on mutual funds purchased, income due to adjustments to certain liabilities assumed as a result of the Reorganization Transactions and net gains on the sale of investment securities, partially offset by an increase in net losses recognized in income related to derivative contracts. The increase in the benefit for income taxes was primarily due to the increase in pretax loss.

The increase in total earning assets for the Treasury and Other segment was primarily due to an increase in our interest-bearing deposits in other banks, partially offset by a decrease in our investment securities portfolio.

Analysis of Financial Condition
​
Liquidity and Capital Resources 
​
Liquidity refers to our ability to maintain cash flow that is adequate to fund operations and meet present and future financial obligations through either the sale or maturity of existing assets or by obtaining additional funding through liability management. We consider the effective and prudent management of liquidity to be fundamental to our health and strength. Our objective is to manage our cash flow and liquidity reserves so that they are adequate to fund our obligations and other commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost.
​
Liquidity is managed to ensure stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of funds to satisfy demand for credit, deposit withdrawals and investment opportunities. Funding requirements are impacted by loan originations and refinancings, deposit balance changes, liability issuances and settlements and off-balance sheet funding commitments. We consider and comply with various regulatory and internal guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitor our liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity. Based on periodic liquidity assessments, we may alter our asset, liability and off-balance sheet positions. The Company’s Asset Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”) monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change. This process, combined with our ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements, provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk.
​
Immediate liquid resources are available in cash which is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (the “FRB”). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, cash and cash equivalents were $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. Potential sources of liquidity also include investment securities in our available-for-sale portfolio and held-to-maturity portfolio. The carrying values of our available-for-sale investment securities and held-to-maturity investment securities were $1.9 billion and $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2024, respectively. The carrying values of our available-for-sale investment securities and held-to-maturity investment securities were $2.3 billion and $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we maintained our excess liquidity primarily in collateralized mortgage obligations issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, Municipal Housing Authorities and non-agency entities. As of December 31, 2024, our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with a weighted average life of approximately 5.4 years and our held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with a weighted average life of approximately 7.6 years. These funds offer substantial resources to meet either new loan demand or to help offset reductions in our deposit funding base as they provide quick sources of liquidity by pledging to obtain secured borrowings and repurchase agreements or sales of our available-for-sale securities portfolio. Liquidity is further enhanced by our ability to pledge loans to access secured borrowings from the FHLB and the FRB. As of December 31, 2024, we have borrowing capacity of $2.8 billion from the FHLB and $3.0 billion from the FRB based on the amount of collateral pledged.

Table of Contents
Our core deposits have historically provided us with a long-term source of stable and relatively lower cost of funding. Our core deposits, defined as all deposits exclusive of time deposits exceeding $250,000, totaled $19.0 billion and $19.5 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, which represented 93% and 91%, respectively, of our total deposits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These core deposits are normally less volatile, often with customer relationships tied to other products offered by the Company; however, deposit levels could decrease if interest rates increase significantly or if corporate customers increase investing activities, including alternative investment options, that reduce deposit balances.
​
Our material cash requirements from our current and long-term contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024 are summarized in the following table:

Commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon; therefore, these items, which totaled $6.0 billion and $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are not included in the table above. See the discussion of these credit and contractual commitments in “Note 17. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
​
Other postretirement benefit contributions in the table above represent the minimum expected contribution to the postretirement benefit plan. Actual contributions may differ from these estimates. Excluded from the table above is our pension benefit obligations. We comply with the minimum funding requirements, and we anticipate making future benefit contributions of $0.2 million related to the pension benefit plans during the year ending December 31, 2025. Additional information on these benefit plans can be found in “Note 14. Benefit Plans” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
​
Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits (“UTBs”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $206.4 million and $212.0 million, respectively. The decrease in UTBs was primarily due to reductions related to previously identified tax positions as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations and resolutions with tax authorities. We are unable to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority. As a result, our liability for UTBs is not disclosed in the table above.
​
In addition to the commitments specifically noted in the table above, we enter into a number of purchase obligations that arise from agreements to purchase goods or services in the ordinary course of business. These primarily consist of service agreements for various systems and applications supporting bank operations, including the systems and applications in the Bank’s core system. Some of these contracts are renewable or cancellable annually or in shorter time intervals. To secure favorable pricing concessions, we may also commit to contracts that may extend several years.
​
Other material cash requirements may also include general corporate operating activities, stock repurchases, and capital to be returned to our shareholders.  
​
We expect to meet these obligations from dividends paid by the Bank to the Parent. Additional sources of liquidity available to us include selling residential real estate loans in the secondary market, taking out short- and long-term borrowings and issuing long-term debt and equity securities. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, investments, and cash expected to be generated from operations, are still sufficient to meet our cash requirements within the next 12 months and beyond.

Table of Contents
Potential Demands on Liquidity from Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
​
We have off-balance sheet arrangements, such as variable interest entities, guarantees, and certain financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, that may affect the Company’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
​
Variable Interest Entities
​
We hold interests in several unconsolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”). These unconsolidated VIEs are primarily low-income housing tax credit investments in partnerships and limited liability companies. Variable interests are defined as contractual ownership or other interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in an entity’s net asset value. The primary beneficiary consolidates the VIE. Based on our analysis, we have determined that the Company is not the primary beneficiary of these entities. As a result, we do not consolidate these VIEs. Unfunded commitments to fund these low-income housing tax credit investments were $98.7 million and $80.7 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
​
Guarantees
​
We sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market primarily to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The agreements under which we sell residential mortgage loans to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac contain provisions that include various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the residential mortgage loans. Although the specific representations and warranties vary among investors, insurance or guarantee agreements, they typically cover: ownership of the loan; validity of the lien securing the loan; the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan; compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement; compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws; and other matters. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the unpaid principal balance of our portfolio of residential mortgage loans sold was $1.3 billion. The agreements under which we sell residential mortgage loans require delivery of various documents to the investor or its document custodian. Although these loans are primarily sold on a non-recourse basis, we may be obligated to repurchase residential mortgage loans or reimburse investors for losses incurred if a loan review reveals that underwriting and documentation standards were potentially not met in the origination of those loans. Upon receipt of a repurchase request, we work with investors to arrive at a mutually agreeable resolution. Repurchase demands are typically reviewed on an individual loan by loan basis to validate the claims made by the investor to determine if a contractually required repurchase event has occurred. We manage the risk associated with potential repurchases or other forms of settlement through our underwriting and quality assurance practices and by servicing mortgage loans to meet investor and secondary market standards. For the year ended December 31, 2024, there was one residential mortgage loan repurchase totaling $0.6 million and there were no pending repurchase requests.
​
In addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, substantially all of the loans we sell to investors are sold with servicing rights retained. We also service loans originated by other mortgage loan originators. As servicer, our primary duties are to: (1) collect payments due from borrowers; (2) advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest; (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title, or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage loans; (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments; and (5) foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans, or loan modifications or short sales. Each agreement under which we act as servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for actions taken by the Company in such capacity and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred by the Company when acting in compliance with the respective servicing agreements. However, if we commit a material breach of obligations as servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period following notice. The standards governing servicing and the possible remedies for violations of such standards vary by investor. These standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides issued by the investors as well as the contract provisions established between the investors and the Company. Remedies could include repurchase of an affected loan. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we had no repurchase requests related to loan servicing activities, nor were there any pending repurchase requests as of December 31, 2024.
​
68

Table of Contents
Although to date repurchase requests related to representation and warranty provisions and servicing activities have been limited, it is possible that requests to repurchase mortgage loans may increase in frequency as investors more aggressively pursue all means of recovering losses on their purchased loans. However, as of December 31, 2024, management believes that this exposure is not material due to the historical level of repurchase requests and loss trends and thus has not established a liability for losses related to mortgage loan repurchases. As of December 31, 2024, 99% of our residential mortgage loans serviced for investors were current. We maintain ongoing communications with investors and continue to evaluate this exposure by monitoring the level and number of repurchase requests as well as the delinquency rates in loans sold to investors.
​
Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
​
The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit which are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
​
See “Note 17. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on our financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk.

Maturities for mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations anticipate future prepayments.
​
The carrying value of our investment securities portfolio was $5.7 billion as of December 31, 2024, a decrease of $579.6 million or 9% compared to December 31, 2023. The lower balances in investment securities were driven by payments and maturities during the year ended December 31, 2024, which were used to fund loan growth and offset a decline in deposits and borrowings. Additionally, a restructuring of the available-for-sale investment portfolio was conducted in the fourth quarter of 2024, whereby sales and purchases were conducted to improve the return of the investment portfolio. Our available-for-sale investment securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other comprehensive income (loss) or through the Provision. Our held-to-maturity investment securities are carried at amortized cost.
​
As of December 31, 2024, we maintained all of our investment securities in either the available-for-sale category (recorded at fair value) or the held-to-maturity category (recorded at amortized cost) in the consolidated balance sheets, with $3.1 billion invested in collateralized mortgage obligations issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Our investment securities portfolio also included $2.3 billion in mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Municipal Housing Authorities and non-agency entities, $173.5 million in collateralized loan obligations, $57.4 million in debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, government agencies (U.S. International Development Finance Corporation bonds) and government-sponsored enterprises and $54.6 million in debt securities issued by states and political subdivisions.
​
We continually evaluate our investment securities portfolio in response to established asset/liability management objectives, changing market conditions that could affect profitability and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to change the level of funds we deploy into investment securities and change the composition of our investment securities portfolio.

Gross unrealized gains in our investment securities portfolio were $0.6 million and $0.2 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gross unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio were $792.7 million and $770.2 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The higher overall gross unrealized loss position was primarily due to an increase in gross unrealized losses on our held-to-maturity securities due to changes in the market value of the securities, partially offset by a decrease in gross unrealized losses on our available-for-sale securities due to paydowns in our investment securities portfolio, changes in market value of the securities and the 2024 portfolio restructuring.
​
For our available-for-sale investment securities, we conduct a regular assessment of our investment securities portfolio to determine whether any securities are impaired. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through the allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not record any credit losses related to our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio.
​
For our held-to-maturity investment securities, we utilize the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) approach to estimate lifetime expected credit losses. Substantially all of our held-to-maturity securities are issued by the U.S. Government, its agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. These securities have a long history of no credit losses and carry the explicit or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government. Therefore, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not record an allowance for credit losses related to our held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio.
​
We are required to hold non-marketable equity securities, comprised of FHLB stock, as a condition of our membership in the FHLB system. Our FHLB stock is accounted for at cost, which equals par or redemption value. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we held $21.4 million and $32.6 million in FHLB stock, respectively, which is recorded as a component of other assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 
​
See “Note 3. Investment Securities” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on our investment securities portfolio.

Table of Contents
Commercial and industrial loans are made primarily to corporations, middle market and small businesses for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition, expansion, working capital and other general business purposes. We also offer a variety of automobile dealer flooring lines to our customers in Hawaii and California to assist with the financing of their inventory. Commercial and industrial loans were $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $82.1 million or 4% from December 31, 2023. 
​
Commercial real estate loans are secured by first mortgages on commercial real estate at loan to value (“LTV”) ratios generally not exceeding 75% and a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.20 to 1. The commercial properties are predominantly apartments, neighborhood and grocery anchored retail, industrial, office, and to a lesser extent, specialized properties such as hotels. The primary source of repayment for investor property and owner occupied property is cash flow from the property and the operating cash flow from the business, respectively. Commercial real estate loans were $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $123.7 million or 3% from December 31, 2023. 
​
Construction loans are for the purchase or construction of a property for which repayment will be generated by the property. Loans in this portfolio are primarily for the purchase of land, as well as for the development of commercial properties, single family homes and condominiums. We classify loans as construction until the completion of the construction phase. Following construction, if a loan is retained by the Bank, the loan is reclassified to the commercial real estate or residential real estate classes of loans. Construction loans were $918.3 million as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $18.0 million or 2% from December 31, 2023. 
​

Residential real estate loans are generally secured by 1-4 unit residential properties and are underwritten using traditional underwriting systems to assess the credit risks and financial capacity and repayment ability of the consumer. Decisions are primarily based on LTV ratios, debt-to-income (“DTI”) ratios, liquidity and credit scores. LTV ratios generally do not exceed 80%, although higher levels are permitted with mortgage insurance. We offer fixed rate mortgage products and variable rate mortgage products including HELOC. Since our transition from LIBOR in late 2021, we now offer variable rate mortgage products based on SOFR with interest rates that are subject to change every six months after the third, fifth, seventh or tenth year, depending on the product. Prior to this, we offered variable rate mortgage products based on LIBOR with interest rates that were subject to change every year after the first, third, fifth or tenth year, depending on the product. Variable rate residential mortgage loans are underwritten at fully-indexed interest rates. We generally do not offer interest-only, payment-option facilities, or any product with negative amortization. Residential real estate loans were $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2024, a decrease of $138.0 million or 3% from December 31, 2023.

​
Consumer loans consist primarily of open- and closed-end direct and indirect credit facilities for personal, automobile and household purchases as well as credit card loans. We seek to maintain reasonable levels of risk in consumer lending by following prudent underwriting guidelines, which include an evaluation of personal credit history, cash flow and collateral values based on existing market conditions. Consumer loans were $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2024, a decrease of $85.9 million or 8% from December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily due to runoffs in the indirect automobile loan portfolio during the year. 
​
Lease financing consists of commercial single investor leases and leveraged leases. Underwriting of new lease transactions is based on our lending policy, including but not limited to an analysis of customer cash flows and secondary sources of repayment, including the value of leased equipment, the guarantors’ cash flows and/or other credit enhancements. No new leveraged leases are being added to the portfolio and all remaining leveraged leases are running off. Lease financing was $434.7 million as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $54.8 million or 14% from December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the closing of several large lease transactions during the year.
​
See “Note 4. Loans and Leases” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and the discussion in “Analysis of Financial Condition — Allowance for Credit Losses” of this MD&A for more information on our loan and lease portfolio.

For secured loans and leases, classification as U.S. Mainland is made based on where the collateral is located.  For unsecured loans and leases, classification as U.S. Mainland is made based on the location where the majority of the borrower's business operations are conducted.
​
Our lending activities are concentrated primarily in Hawaii. However, we also have lending activities on the U.S. mainland, Guam and Saipan. Our commercial lending activities on the U.S. mainland include automobile dealer flooring activities in California, participation in the Shared National Credits Program and selective commercial real estate projects based on existing customer relationships. Our lease financing portfolio includes commercial leveraged and single investor lease financing activities both in Hawaii and on the U.S. mainland.  However, no new leveraged leases are being added to the portfolio and all remaining leveraged leases are running off. Our consumer lending activities are concentrated primarily in Hawaii and to a smaller extent, Guam and Saipan.

Credit Quality
​
We evaluate certain loans and leases, including commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans and construction loans, individually for impairment and non-accrual status. A loan is considered to be impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. We generally place a loan on non-accrual status when management believes that collection of principal or interest has become doubtful or when a loan or lease becomes 90 days past due as to principal or interest, unless it is well secured and in the process of collection. Loans on non-accrual status are generally classified as impaired, but not all impaired loans are necessarily placed on non-accrual status. See “Note 5. Allowance for Credit Losses” in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information about our credit quality indicators.
​
For purposes of managing credit risk and estimating the ACL, management has identified three portfolio segments (commercial, residential and consumer) that we use to develop our systematic methodology to determine the ACL. The categorization of loans for the evaluation of credit risk is specific to our credit risk evaluation process and these loan categories are not necessarily the same as the loan categories used for other evaluations of our loan portfolio. See “Note 5. Allowance for Credit Losses” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information about our approach to estimating the ACL.
​
The following tables and discussion address non-performing assets and loans and leases that are 90 days past due but are still accruing interest.

The level of NPAs represents an indicator of the potential for future credit losses. NPAs consist of non-accrual loans and leases and OREO. Changes in the level of non-accrual loans and leases typically represent increases for loans and leases that reach a specified past due status, offset by reductions for loans and leases that are charged-off, paid down, sold, transferred to held for sale classification, transferred to OREO or are no longer classified as non-accrual because they have returned to accrual status as a result of continued performance and an improvement in the borrower’s financial condition and loan repayment capabilities. 
​
Total NPAs were $20.7 million as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $2.1 million or 11% from December 31, 2023. The ratio of our NPAs to total loans and leases and OREO was 0.14% as of December 31, 2024, an increase of one basis point from December 31, 2023. The increase in total NPAs was primarily due to a $5.1 million increase in residential mortgage loans, partially offset by decreases in commercial real estate loans of $2.5 million and commercial and industrial loans of $0.6 million.
​
The largest component of our NPAs continues to be residential mortgage loans. The level of these NPAs remains elevated due to a lengthy judicial foreclosure process in Hawaii. As of December 31, 2024, residential mortgage non-accrual loans were $12.8 million, an increase of $5.1 million or 68% from December 31, 2023. This increase was due to additions in residential mortgage loans of $8.0 million, partially offset by $2.2 million in payments, $0.6 million in returns to accrual status and a $0.1 million transfer to OREO. As of December 31, 2024, our residential mortgage non-accrual loans were comprised of 49 loans with a weighted average current loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio of 44%.
​
Home equity line non-accrual loans were $7.2 million as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $0.1 million or 2% from December 31, 2023. This increase was due to additions in home equity lines of $5.5 million, partially offset by payments of $3.1 million and returns to accrual status of $2.3 million. 
​
OREO represents property acquired as a result of borrower defaults on loans. OREO is recorded at fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure. On an ongoing basis, properties are appraised as required by market conditions and applicable regulations. There was no OREO held as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
​
Loans and Leases Past Due 90 Days or More and Still Accruing Interest.
 Loans and leases in this category are 90 days or more past due, as to principal or interest, and are still accruing interest because they are well secured and in the process of collection. 
​
Loans and leases past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest were $6.0 million as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $2.5 million or 72% as compared to December 31, 2023. This increase was due to increases in residential mortgage loans of $1.3 million, commercial and industrial loans of $0.9 million and construction loans of $0.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in commercial real estate loans of $0.3 million that were past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest as of December 31, 2024.

As of December 31, 2024, the ACL was $160.4 million or 1.11% of total loans and leases outstanding, compared with an ACL of $156.5 million or 1.09% of total loans and leases outstanding as of December 31, 2023. The level of the Allowance was commensurate with our stable credit risk profile, loan portfolio growth and composition and a stable Hawaii economy.
​
Net charge-offs of loans and leases were $13.6 million or 0.10% of total average loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $12.2 million or 0.09% for 2023. Net charge-offs in our commercial lending portfolio were $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to net charge-offs of $2.6 million for 2023. Net recoveries in our residential lending portfolio were $0.4 million for both the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Net charge-offs in our consumer lending portfolio were $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to net charge-offs of $10.0 million for 2023. Net charge-offs in our consumer portfolio segment include those related to credit card, automobile loans, installment loans and small business lines of credit and reflect the inherent risk associated with these loans. 
​
Although we determine the amount of each component of the ACL separately, the ACL as a whole was considered appropriate by management as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2024, the ACL was considered adequate based on our ongoing analysis of estimated expected credit losses, credit risk profiles, current economic outlook, coverage ratios and other relevant factors. The ACL anticipates cyclical losses consistent with a recession and includes a qualitative overlay for macroeconomic uncertainties. We will continue to monitor factors that drive expected credit losses including the uncertainty of the economy, inflation and geopolitical instability.
​
See “Note 5. Allowance for Credit Losses” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on the ACL.

Goodwill
​
Goodwill was $995.5 million as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. Our goodwill originated from the acquisition of the Company by BNPP in December of 2001. Goodwill generated in that acquisition was recorded on the balance sheet of the Bank as a result of push down accounting treatment, and remains on our consolidated balance sheets. 
​
The Company’s policy is to assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or between annual assessments if a triggering event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The Company performed its annual assessment of the criteria included in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350, 
Intangibles – Goodwill and Other
, and based on such assessment, the Company concluded that there was no impairment in our goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2024. Future events, including volatility in domestic and global markets, geopolitical concerns, inflation concerns, global supply chain issues, and other factors affecting the economy, that could cause a significant decline in our expected future cash flows or a significant adverse change in our business or the business climate may necessitate taking charges in future reporting periods related to the impairment of our goodwill.
​
Other Assets
​
Other assets were $832.0 million as of December 31, 2024, a decrease of $13.7 million or 2% from December 31, 2023. This decrease was due to a $34.5 million decrease in interest-earning advances, an $11.6 million decrease in variable interest securities and a $10.4 million decrease in current tax receivables and deferred tax assets, partially offset by a $28.6 million increase in affordable housing and other tax credit investment partnership interests and a $9.8 million increase in prepaid expenses.
​
Deposits
​
Deposits are the primary funding source for the Bank and are acquired from a broad base of local markets, including both individual and corporate customers. We obtain funds from depositors by offering a range of deposit types, including demand, savings, money market and time.

Total deposits were $20.3 billion as of December 31, 2024, a decrease of $1.0 billion or 5% from December 31, 2023. The decrease in deposit balances stemmed primarily from a $747.6 million decrease in public time deposit balances, a $619.0 million decrease in non-public demand deposit balances and a $270.9 million decrease in public savings deposit balances. These decreases were partially offset by a $589.8 million increase in non-public time deposit balances.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the amount of deposits that exceeded FDIC insurance limits were estimated to be $9.9 billion, or 49% of total deposits, and $10.8 billion, or 51% of total deposits, respectively. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $0.8 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, of public deposits, all of which were fully collateralized with investment securities. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the amount of deposits excluding public deposits that exceeded FDIC insurance limits were estimated to be $9.2 billion, or 45% of total deposits, and $9.1 billion, or 42% of total deposits, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, deposits accounts above $250,000 were estimated to be $11.6 billion and $12.6 billion, respectively.

Short-term Borrowings
​
As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s short-term borrowings consisted of $250.0 million in short-term FHLB fixed-rate advances with a weighted average interest rate of 4.16% maturing in September 2025. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s short-term borrowings consisted of $500.0 million in short-term FHLB fixed-rate advances with a weighted average interest rate of 4.71% that matured in September 2024.
​
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had a remaining line of credit of $2.8 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, available from the FHLB. The FHLB borrowing capacity was secured by commercial real estate and residential real estate loan collateral as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
​
Pension and Postretirement Plan Obligations
​
We have a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, an unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan for certain key executives (“SERP”), a directors’ retirement plan, a non-qualified pension plan for eligible directors and a postretirement benefit plan providing life insurance and healthcare benefits that we offer to our directors and employees, as applicable. The qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, the SERP and the directors’ retirement plan are all frozen plans to new participants. In March 2019, the Company’s board of directors approved an amendment to the SERP to freeze the SERP, which became effective on July 1, 2019. As a result of the amendment, since the effective date, there have not been any, and there will be no, new accruals of benefits, including service accruals. Existing benefits under the SERP, as of the effective date of the amendment described above, will otherwise continue in accordance with the terms of the SERP. To calculate annual pension costs, we use the following key variables: (1) size of the employee population, length of service and estimated compensation increases; (2) actuarial assumptions and estimates; (3) expected long-term rate of return on plan assets; and (4) discount rate.
​
Pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations, net of pension plan assets, were $86.0 million as of December 31, 2024, a decrease of $6.7 million or 7% from December 31, 2023. The balance as of December 31, 2024 included retirement benefits payable of $97.1 million for the Company’s underfunded plans, partially offset by pension plan assets for overfunded plans, recorded as a component of other assets on the consolidated balance sheets, of $11.1 million.
​
See “Note 14. Benefit Plans” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on our pension and postretirement benefit plans.

Capital
​
The Company and the Bank are subject to the Capital Rules, which implemented the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s December 2010 final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards, known as Basel III, and various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Capital Rules require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital than previously required, with a greater emphasis on common equity. The Capital Rules, among other things, (i) impose a capital measure called CET1, (ii) specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and ‘‘Additional Tier 1 capital’’ instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations. 
​
The Capital Rules also require a 2.5% capital conservation buffer designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The capital conservation buffer is composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk weighted asset ratios, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) 7% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) 8.5% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and (iii) 10.5% total capital to risk-weighted assets.
​
As of December 31, 2024, our capital levels remained characterized as “well capitalized” under the Capital Rules. The Company’s regulatory capital ratios, calculated in accordance with the Capital Rules, are presented in Table 24 below. See “Note 12. Regulatory Capital Requirements” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information. There have been no conditions or events since December 31, 2024 that management believes have changed either the Company’s or the Bank’s capital classifications.

Total stockholders’ equity was $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of $131.4 million or 5% from December 31, 2023. The increase in stockholders’ equity was primarily due to earnings for the year ended December 31, 2024 of $230.1 million and other comprehensive income, net of tax, of $66.2 million, primarily due to changes in our investment securities portfolio. This was partially offset by dividends declared and paid to the Company’s stockholders of $132.8 million and common stock repurchased for approximately $40.0 million.
​
In January 2024, the Company announced a stock repurchase program for up to $40.0 million of its outstanding common stock during 2024. Under this plan, the Company repurchased 1,473,576 shares at a total cost of approximately $40.0 million during 2024. In January 2025, the Company announced a stock repurchase program for up to $100.0 million of its outstanding common stock during 2025. The timing and exact amount of stock repurchases, if any, will be subject to management’s discretion and various factors, including the Company’s capital position and financial performance, as well as market conditions. The stock repurchase program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason.

In January 2025, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per share on our outstanding shares. The dividend is to be paid on February 28, 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 14, 2025. 
​
Critical Accounting Policies
​
Our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate. The most significant accounting policies we follow are presented in “Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Application of these principles requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. These factors include among other things, whether the policy requires management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. The accounting policies which we believe to be most critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements are those that are related to the determination of the ACL, fair value estimates, pension and postretirement benefit obligations and income taxes.
​
Allowance for Credit Losses
​
Management’s evaluation of the adequacy of the ACL is often the most critical of accounting estimates for a financial institution. Our determination of the amount of the ACL is a critical accounting estimate as it requires significant reliance on the accuracy of credit risk ratings on individual borrowers, the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, significant reliance on estimated loss rates on portfolios and consideration of our evaluation of macro-economic factors and trends. While our methodology involves estimating an ACL for each of our commercial, residential real estate and consumer portfolio segments, the entire ACL is available to absorb credit losses in the total loan and lease portfolio.
​
The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans and leases to present the net amount expected to be collected from loans and leases. Loans and leases are charged-off against the ACL when management believes the loan or lease balance is deemed uncollectible. Recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off. Changes in the ACL and, therefore, in the related Provision, can materially affect net income. In applying the judgment and review required to determine the ACL, management considers changes in economic conditions, customer behavior, and collateral value, among other factors. Economic factors or business decisions may affect the composition and mix of the loan and lease portfolio, causing management to increase or decrease the ACL.
​
The following are some of the significant judgments and inherent limitations which affect the estimate of the ACL:
​
●
The Accuracy of Internal Credit Risk Ratings, Monitoring of Loans Past Due and Delinquency Trends.
 The ACL related to our commercial portfolio segment is generally most sensitive to the accuracy of internal credit risk ratings assigned to each borrower. Commercial loan risk ratings are evaluated based on each situation by experienced senior credit officers and are subject to periodic review by an internal team of credit specialists. 
●
Data.
 We have applied considerable judgments about the sufficiency and applicability of our internal data to provide an accurate view of historical loss information. For each of our portfolio segments we have examined between 8 and 12 years of historical data. For many of our residential real estate and consumer loan classes, we have assumed that the historical loss period observed is sufficient to capture a full credit loss cycle and that the credit loss exposures observed over this historical loss period are representative of those for which we will be making estimates of future expected credit losses under CECL. In making this assumption, we have relied on the fact that the historical loss period for the vast majority of our different loan portfolio segments incorporated the most recent observed recessionary period as well as the subsequent period of sustained recovery and growth.

●
Reasonable and Supportable Forecast Period.
 For contractual periods which extend beyond the one-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, management elected an immediate reversion to the mean approach. Management will continue to assess whether a one-year reasonable and supportable forecast period is appropriate. Changes to the economic environment and uncertainty with regards to the timing and extent of an economic recovery may result in management decreasing or increasing the current reasonable and supportable forecast period.
●
Economic Adjustments over the Reasonable and Supportable Forecast Period. 
The Company uses a multi-variable regression model to estimate the impact of Management’s economic outlook over the reasonable and supportable forecast period. The model uses economic forecasts as the input and outputs modifiers that adjust the long-run default/loss rates. The Company’s economic forecast framework allows management to use judgment in selecting the economic model input and output.
●
Qualitative Adjustments. 
For risks not captured in the long-run default/loss rates or in the economic forecast model, the Company applies segment or account level dollar adjustments. These adjustments are estimated based on the best information available as of the reporting date and may include, as appropriate, overlays to account for macroeconomic uncertainties, adjustments for model limitations, regulatory determinants, overlays for natural disasters, and other events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Maui wildfires.
●
Identification and Measurement of Individually Assessed Loans, including Loans Modified with a Borrower Experiencing Financial Difficulty.
 Our experienced senior credit officers may consider a loan impaired based on their evaluation of current information and events, including loans modified with a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. The measurement of impairment is typically based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows or fair value of collateral less estimated selling costs. The development of these expectations requires significant management judgment and estimation.
The ACL for loans and leases was $160.4 million as of December 31, 2024, which represented an increase of $3.9 million, compared to the ACL for loans and leases of $156.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The overall level of the ACL was commensurate with our stable credit risk profile, loan portfolio growth and composition and a stable Hawaii economy. The reserve for unfunded commitments was $32.8 million as of December 31, 2024, which represented a decrease of $2.8 million, compared to the reserve for unfunded commitments of $35.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The ACL for loans and leases and the reserve for unfunded commitments was considered adequate based on our ongoing analysis of estimated expected credit losses, credit risk profiles, current economic outlook, coverage ratios and other relevant factors. The ACL anticipates cyclical losses consistent with a recession and includes a qualitative overlay for macroeconomic uncertainties. We will continue to monitor factors that drive expected credit losses including the uncertainty of the economy, inflation and geopolitical instability. 
​
To illustrate the sensitivity of the Company’s ACL model to credit quality, we downgraded the internal credit risk ratings on commercial loans by one grade and reduced FICO scores on retail loans by ten points. Downgrading 1% of our commercial portfolio would increase the ACL at December 31, 2024 by approximately $1.3 million, and reducing FICO scores on the entire retail portfolio would increase the ACL at December 31, 2024 by approximately $3.7 million. These sensitivity analyses are hypothetical and have been provided only to indicate the potential impact that changes in internal credit risk ratings and FICO scores may have on the ACL estimate, with all other inputs remaining constant.

Fair Value Measurements
​
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market inputs. For financial instruments that are traded actively and have quoted market prices or observable market inputs, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. However, when quoted market prices or observable market inputs are not fully available, significant management judgment may be necessary to estimate fair value. In developing our fair value measurements, we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
​
The fair value hierarchy defines Level 1 valuations as those based on quoted prices, unadjusted, for identical instruments traded in active markets. Level 2 valuations are those based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Level 3 valuations are based on model-based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market, or significant management judgment or estimation, some of which may be internally developed.
​
Financial assets that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include available for sale investment securities, and derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $1.9 billion or 8% and $2.3 billion or 9%, respectively, of our total assets consisted of financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and most of these financial assets consisted of available for sale investment securities measured using information from a third-party pricing service. These investments in debt securities and mortgage backed securities were classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Financial liabilities that were recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were comprised of derivative financial instruments. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $8.4 million or less than 1% and $4.6 million or less than 1%, respectively, of our total liabilities, consisted of financial liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $6.1 million and $2.3 million, respectively, was classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, $2.3 million was classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the liability which was classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy was related to the sale of our Visa Class B restricted shares in 2016. We recorded a derivative liability which requires payment to the buyer of the Visa Class B restricted shares in the event Visa further reduces the conversion rate to its publicly traded Visa Class A shares. 
​
Our third-party pricing service makes no representations or warranties that the pricing data provided to us is complete or free from errors, omissions or defects. As a result, we have processes in place to monitor and periodically review the information provided to us by our third-party pricing service:
​
(1)
Our third-party pricing service provides us with documentation by asset class of inputs and methodologies used to value securities. We review this documentation to evaluate the inputs and valuation methodologies used to place securities into the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy. This documentation is periodically updated by our third-party pricing service. Accordingly, transfers of securities within the fair value hierarchy are made if deemed necessary. 
​
(2)
On a monthly basis, management reviews the pricing information received from our third-party pricing service. This review process includes a comparison to non-binding third-party broker quotes, as well as a review of market related conditions impacting the information provided by our third-party pricing service. We also identify investment securities which may have traded in illiquid or inactive markets by identifying instances of a significant decrease in the volume or frequency of trades relative to historic levels, as well as instances of a significant widening of the bid ask spread in the brokered markets. 
​
(3)
Our third-party pricing service has also established processes for us to submit inquiries regarding quoted prices. Periodically, we will challenge the quoted prices provided by our third-party pricing service. Our third-party pricing service will review the inputs to the evaluation in light of the new market data presented by us. Our third-party pricing service may then affirm the original quoted price or may update the evaluation on a going forward basis.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on our use of fair value estimates.
​
Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations
​
We use the following key variables to calculate annual pension costs: (1) size of the employee population, length of service and estimated compensation increases; (2) actuarial assumptions and estimates; (3) expected long-term rate of return on plan assets; and (4) discount rate. Pension cost is directly affected by the number of employees eligible for pension benefits and their estimated compensation increases. To calculate estimated compensation increases, management reviews our salary increases each year and compares this data with industry information. For all pension and postretirement plan calculations, we use a measurement date of December 31.
​
The expected long-term rate of return was based on a calculated rate of return from average rates of return on various asset classes over a 20-year historical time horizon. Using long-term historical data allows the Company to capture multiple economic environments, which management believes is relevant when using historical returns. Net actuarial gains or losses that exceed a 5% corridor of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year are amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost on a straight-line basis over five years.
​
In estimating the projected benefit obligation, an independent actuary bases assumptions on factors such as mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate, disability rate and other assumptions related to the population of individuals in the pension plan. If significant actuarial gains or losses occur, the actuary reviews the demographic and economic assumptions with management, at which time the Company considers revising these assumptions based on actual results.
​
Our determination of the pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations and net periodic benefit cost is a critical accounting estimate as it requires the use of estimates and judgment related to the amount and timing of expected future cash outflows for benefit payments and cash inflows for maturities and return on plan assets. Changes in estimates and assumptions related to mortality rates and future health care costs could also have a material impact to our financial condition or results of operations. The discount rate assumption is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost. The discount rate assumption used to value the present value of future benefit obligations as of each year end is the rate used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the following year.
​
The projected benefit obligation for pension benefits was $142.2 million as of December 31, 2024, which represented a decrease of $11.4 million, compared to the projected benefit obligation for pension benefits of $153.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other benefits was $16.8 million as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.
​
To illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, if the discount rate assumption decreased by 100 basis points, the projected benefit obligation for pension benefits and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other benefits at December 31, 2024 would increase by approximately $10.3 million and $1.3 million, respectively. 
​
See “Note 14. Benefit Plans” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations.
​
Income Taxes
​
In estimating income taxes payable or receivable, we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of each tax position. Accordingly, previously estimated liabilities are regularly reevaluated and adjusted through the provision for income taxes. Changes in the estimate of income taxes payable or receivable occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax law, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, the expiration of statutes of limitations and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative merits and risks of each tax position. These changes, when they occur, may affect the provision for income taxes as well as current and deferred income taxes, and may be significant to our consolidated statements of income and balance sheets.

Management's determination of the realization of net deferred tax assets is based upon management's judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income, as well as the implementation of various tax planning strategies to maximize realization of the deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
​
We are also required to record a liability for UTBs for the entire amount of a tax benefit taken in a prior or future income tax return when we determine that a tax position has a less than 50% likelihood of being accepted by the taxing authority. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our liabilities for UTBs were $206.4 million and $212.0 million, respectively. See “Note 15. Income Taxes” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information on income taxes.

Risk Governance and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
​
Managing risk is an essential part of successfully operating our business. Management believes that the most prominent risk exposures for the Company are credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk management, capital management and operational risk. See “Analysis of Financial Condition — Liquidity” and “—Capital” sections of this MD&A for further discussions of liquidity risk management and capital management, respectively.
​
Credit Risk
​
Credit risk is the risk that borrowers or counterparties will be unable or unwilling to repay their obligations in accordance with the underlying contractual terms. We manage and control credit risk in the loan and lease portfolio by adhering to well-defined underwriting criteria and account administration standards established by management. Written credit policies document underwriting standards, approval levels, exposure limits and other limits or standards deemed necessary and prudent. Portfolio diversification at the obligor, industry, product, and/or geographic location levels is actively managed to mitigate concentration risk. In addition, credit risk management includes an independent credit review process that assesses compliance with commercial, real estate and consumer credit policies, risk ratings and other critical credit information. In addition to implementing risk management practices that are based upon established and sound lending practices, we adhere to sound credit principles. We understand and evaluate our customers’ borrowing needs and capacity to repay, in conjunction with their character and history.
​
Management has identified three categories of loans that we use to develop our systematic methodology to determine the ACL: commercial, residential and consumer.
​
86

Table of Contents
Commercial lending is further categorized into four distinct classes based on characteristics relating to the borrower, transaction and collateral. These classes are: commercial and industrial, commercial real estate, construction and lease financing. Commercial and industrial loans are primarily for the purpose of financing equipment acquisition, expansion, working capital and other general business purposes by medium to larger Hawaii based corporations, as well as U.S. mainland and international companies. Commercial and industrial loans are typically secured by non-real estate assets whereby the collateral is trading assets, enterprise value or inventory. As with many of our customers, our commercial and industrial loan customers are heavily dependent on tourism, government expenditures and real estate values. Commercial real estate loans are secured by real estate, including but not limited to structures and facilities to support activities designated as retail, health care, general office space, warehouse and industrial space. Our Bank’s underwriting policy generally requires that net cash flows from the property be sufficient to service the debt while still maintaining an appropriate amount of reserves. Commercial real estate loans in Hawaii are characterized by having a limited supply of real estate at commercially attractive locations, long delivery time frames for development and high interest rate sensitivity. Our construction lending portfolio consists primarily of land loans, single family and condominium development loans. Financing of construction loans is subject to a high degree of credit risk given the long delivery time frames for such projects. Construction lending activities are underwritten on a project financing basis whereby the cash flows or lease rents from the underlying real estate collateral or the sale of the finished inventory is the primary source of repayment. Market feasibility analysis is typically performed by assessing market comparables, market conditions and demand in the specific lending area and general community. We require presales of finished inventory or preleasing requirements prior to loan funding. However, because this analysis is typically performed on a forward-looking basis, real estate construction projects typically present a higher risk profile in our lending activities. Lease financing activities include commercial single investor leases and leveraged leases used to purchase items ranging from computer equipment to transportation equipment. Underwriting of new leasing arrangements typically includes analyzing customer cash flows, evaluating secondary sources of repayment, such as the value of the leased asset, the guarantors’ net cash flows as well as other credit enhancements provided by the lessee.
​
Residential lending is further categorized into the following classes: residential mortgages (loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties and home equity loans) and home equity lines of credit. Our Bank’s underwriting standards typically require LTV ratios of not more than 80%, although higher levels are permitted with accompanying mortgage insurance. First mortgage loans secured by residential properties generally carry a moderate level of credit risk, with an average loan size of approximately $394,000 as of December 31, 2024. Residential mortgage loan production is added to our loan portfolio or is sold in the secondary market, based on management’s evaluation of our liquidity, capital and loan portfolio mix as well as market conditions. Changes in interest rates, the economic environment and other market factors have impacted, and will likely continue to impact, the marketability and value of collateral and the financial condition of our borrowers which impacts the level of credit risk inherent in this portfolio, although we remain in a supply constrained housing environment in Hawaii. Geographic concentrations exist for this portfolio as nearly all residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit are for residences located in Hawaii, Guam or Saipan. These island locales are susceptible to a wide array of potential natural disasters including, but not limited to, hurricanes, floods, tsunamis and earthquakes. We offer home equity lines of credit with variable rates; fixed rate lock options may be available post-closing.  All lines are underwritten at 0.95% of the credit line amount. Our procedures for underwriting home equity lines of credit include an assessment of an applicant’s overall financial capacity and repayment ability. Decisions are primarily based on repayment ability via debt-to-income ratios, LTV ratios and an evaluation of credit history.
​

Table of Contents
Consumer lending is further categorized into the following classes of loans: credit cards, automobile loans and other consumer-related installment loans. Consumer loans are either unsecured or secured by the borrower’s personal assets. The average loan size is generally small and risk is diversified among many borrowers. We offer a wide array of credit cards for business and personal use. In general, our customers are attracted to our credit card offerings on the basis of price, credit limit, reward programs and other product features. Credit card underwriting decisions are generally based on repayment ability of our borrower via DTI ratios, credit bureau information, including payment history, debt burden and credit scores, such as FICO, and analysis of financial capacity. Automobile lending activities include loans and leases secured by new or used automobiles. We originate the majority of our automobile loans and leases on an indirect basis through selected dealerships. Our procedures for underwriting automobile loans include an assessment of an applicant’s overall financial capacity and repayment ability, credit history and the ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan or lease. Although an applicant’s creditworthiness is the primary consideration, the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral security to the proposed loan amount. We require borrowers to maintain full coverage automobile insurance on automobile loans and leases, with the Bank listed as either the loss payee or additional insured. Installment loans consist of open and closed end facilities for personal and household purchases. We seek to maintain reasonable levels of risk in installment lending by following prudent underwriting guidelines which include an evaluation of personal credit history and cash flow.
​
Market Risk
​
Market risk is the potential of loss arising from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices, including the correlation among these factors and their volatility. When the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors, the holder faces market risk. We are exposed to market risk primarily from interest rate risk, which is defined as the risk of loss of net interest income or net interest margin because of changes in interest rates.
​
The potential cash flows, sales or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities, especially those that earn or pay interest, are sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In the banking industry, changes in interest rates can significantly impact earnings and the safety and soundness of an entity. 
​
Interest rate risk arises primarily from our core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. This occurs when our interest earning loans and interest-bearing deposits mature or reprice at different times, on a different basis or in unequal amounts. Interest rates may also affect loan demand, credit losses, mortgage origination volume, pre- payment speeds and other items affecting earnings.
​
Many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, customer preferences, historical pricing relationships and repricing characteristics of financial instruments. Our earnings are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve can influence the overall growth of loans, investment securities and deposits and the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities.
​
Market Risk Measurement
​
We primarily use net interest income simulation analysis to measure and analyze interest rate risk. We run various hypothetical interest rate scenarios and compare these results against a measured base case scenario. Our net interest income simulation analysis incorporates various assumptions, which we believe are reasonable but which may have a significant impact on results. These assumptions include: (1) the timing of changes in interest rates, (2) shifts or rotations in the yield curve, (3) re-pricing characteristics for market rate sensitive instruments on and off-balance sheet, (4) differing sensitivities of financial instruments due to differing underlying rate indices and (5) varying loan prepayment speeds for different interest rate scenarios. Because of limitations inherent in any approach used to measure interest rate risk, simulation results are not intended as a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates on our results but rather as a means to better plan and execute appropriate asset liability management strategies to manage our interest rate risk.

​

Table of Contents
Table 25 presents, for the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2024 and 2023, an estimate of the changes in net interest income that would result from ramps (gradual changes) and shocks (immediate changes) in market interest rates, moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve, relative to the measured base case scenario. Ramp scenarios assume interest rates move gradually in parallel across the yield curve relative to the base case scenario. Shock scenarios assume an immediate and sustained parallel shift in interest rates across the entire yield curve, relative to the base case scenario. The base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are generally unchanged. We evaluate the sensitivity by using a static forecast, where the balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are held constant.

The table above shows the effects of a simulation which estimates the effect of a gradual and immediate sustained parallel shift in the yield curve of −100, −50, +50, +100 and +200 basis points in market interest rates over a twelve-month period on our net interest income.
​
Currently, our interest rate profile, assuming a constant balance sheet, is such that we project net interest income will benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater degree than our liabilities, while in the case of lower interest rates, our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree than our liabilities. Other factors such as changes in balance sheet composition or deposit rate behavior could result in a change in repricing sensitivity.
​
Under the static balance sheet forecast as of December 31, 2024, our net interest income sensitivity profile is slightly lower in higher interest rate scenarios compared to similar forecasts as of December 31, 2023. The sensitivity outcomes described above are primarily due to the impact of changes in deposit mix from December 31, 2023 and holding a smaller federal funds position as of December 31, 2024 as compared with December 31, 2023. 
​
The comparisons above provide insight into the potential effects of changes in interest rates on net interest income. The Company believes that its approach to interest rate risk has appropriately considered its susceptibility to both rising and falling rates and has adopted strategies which minimize the impact of such risks.
​
We also have longer term interest rate risk exposures which may not be appropriately measured by net interest income simulation analysis. We use market value of equity (“MVE”) sensitivity analysis to study the impact of long-term cash flows on earnings and capital. MVE involves discounting present values of all cash flows of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios. The discounted present value of all cash flows represents our MVE. MVE analysis requires modifying the expected cash flows in each interest rate scenario, which will impact the discounted present value. The amount of base case measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longer term repricing option risk in the balance sheet.

Limitations of Market Risk Measures
​
The results of our simulation analyses are hypothetical, and a variety of factors might cause actual results to differ substantially from what is depicted. For example, if the timing and magnitude of interest rate changes differ from those projected, our net interest income might vary significantly. Non-parallel yield curve shifts such as a flattening or steepening of the yield curve or changes in interest rate spreads would also cause our net interest income to be different from that depicted. An increasing interest rate environment could reduce projected net interest income if deposits and other short-term liabilities re-price faster than expected or faster than our assets re-price. Actual results could differ from those projected if we grow assets and liabilities faster or slower than estimated, if we experience a net outflow of deposits or if our mix of assets and liabilities otherwise changes. For example, while we maintain relatively high levels of liquidity, a faster than expected withdrawal of deposits out of the bank may cause us to seek higher cost sources of funding. Actual results could also differ from those projected if we experience substantially different prepayment speeds in our loan portfolio than those assumed in the simulation analyses. Finally, these simulation results do not consider all the actions that we may undertake in response to potential or actual changes in interest rates, such as changes to our loan, investment, deposit, funding or hedging strategies.
​
Market Risk Governance
​
We seek to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and capital while managing volatility arising from changes in market interest rates. The objective of our interest rate risk management process is to increase net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.
​
To manage the impact on net interest income, we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates through our asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by our ALCO and approved by our board of directors. The ALCO has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with the ALCO management policies, including interest rate risk exposures. The objective of our interest rate risk management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.
​
Through review and oversight by the ALCO, we attempt to engage in strategies that neutralize interest rate risk as much as possible. Our use of derivative financial instruments, as detailed in “Note 16. Derivative Financial Instruments” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, has generally been limited. This is due to natural on balance sheet hedges arising out of offsetting interest rate exposures from loans and investment securities with deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. In particular, the investment securities portfolio is utilized to manage the interest rate exposure and sensitivity to within the guidelines and limits established by the ALCO. We utilize natural and offsetting economic hedges in an effort to reduce the need to employ off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk exposures. Expected movements in interest rates are also considered in managing interest rate risk. Thus, as interest rates change, we may use different techniques to manage interest rate risk.
​
Management uses the results of its various simulation analyses to formulate strategies to achieve a desired risk profile within the parameters of our capital and liquidity guidelines.
​
In addition, our business relied upon a large volume of loans, derivative contracts and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR to establish their interest rate and/or value. According to the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings have ceased to be provided or ceased to be representative after June 30, 2023. The publication of all other LIBOR settings ceased to be provided or ceased to be representative as of December 31, 2021. We transitioned our financial instruments associated to LIBOR currencies and tenors that ceased or became nonrepresentative on December 31, 2021, to alternative reference rates (collectively, “Alternative Rates”), with limited exceptions. As such, effective December 31, 2021, we have ceased the use of U.S Dollar LIBOR as a reference rate on all new contracts and continue to increase the usage of 
Alternative Rates such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). A working group of key stakeholders from throughout the Company spearhead
ed
 the transition from LIBOR to Alternative Rates. There are risks inherent with the transition to any Alternative Rate as the rate may behave differently than LIBOR in reaction to monetary,
 market and economic events. The working group disbanded after the conclusion of the transition in December 2023.
​
90

Table of Contents
Our LIBOR transition plan included work to ensure that our technology systems were prepared for the transition, our loan documents that reference LIBOR-based rates were appropriately amended to reference other methods of interest rate determinations and internal and external stakeholders were apprised of the transition. We have implemented certain Prime Rate and SOFR conventions as we transitioned our products and transaction agreements to reference rates other than LIBOR. Commercial loans, investment securities, and residential mortgages have transitioned to SOFR rates. To see the recorded investment in our loan and lease portfolio by rate type, refer to Table 12 in the section titled “Loans and Leases” in this MD&A.
​
Operational Risk
​
Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed processes, people or systems, external events (such as natural disasters), or compliance, reputational or legal matters, including the risk of loss resulting from fraud, litigation and breaches in data security. Operational risk is inherent in all of our business ventures and the management of that risk is important to the achievement of our objectives. We have a framework in place that includes the reporting and assessment of any operational risk events, and the assessment of our mitigating strategies within our key business lines. This framework is implemented through our policies, processes and reporting requirements. We measure and report operational risk using the seven operational risk event types projected by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in Basel II: (1) external fraud; (2) internal fraud; (3) employment practices and workplace safety; (4) clients, products and business practices; (5) damage to physical assets; (6) business disruption and system failures; and (7) execution, delivery and process management. Our operational risk review process is also a core part of our assessment of material new products or activities.

ITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
​
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
​
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
First Hawaiian, Inc.
Honolulu, Hawaii
​
Opinion on the Financial Statements 
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of First Hawaiian, Inc. and subsidiary (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)—Refer to Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements. 
Critical Audit Matter Description 
The Company’s ACL methodology consists of a quantitative estimation model and qualitative adjustments to account for current conditions and forward-looking factors not captured in the quantitative model. Qualitative adjustments the Company’s management considered include adjustments for macroeconomic uncertainties, regulatory determinants, model limitations, and other current or anticipated events that are not captured in the Company’s quantitative model.

Table of Contents
Determining the appropriate level of qualitative adjustments is inherently subjective and relies on significant judgment. Given the magnitude of the impact and significant amount of judgment required by management in developing the qualitative adjustment for macroeconomic uncertainties, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the qualitative adjustment for macroeconomic uncertainties required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort. 
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the qualitative adjustment for macroeconomic uncertainties included the following procedures, among others:
​
●
We tested the effectiveness of controls over the qualitative adjustments with the ACL model, including management’s review over the qualitative adjustment for macroeconomic uncertainties.
●
We evaluated the reasonableness and conceptual soundness of the ACL modeling framework, including the use of qualitative adjustments.
●
We tested the mathematical accuracy of the calculation of the ACL, as well as the accuracy and completeness of data used as inputs to the determination of the qualitative adjustment for macroeconomic uncertainties. 
●
We evaluated the qualitative adjustment for macroeconomic uncertainties, including assessing the reasonableness of and basis for the adjustment.
●
We evaluated the magnitude and proportion of the overall ACL, including the directional consistency of the qualitative adjustment for macroeconomic uncertainties, as well as the absolute value of the ACL attributable to the qualitative adjustments.
●
We performed analytical analysis, including retrospective review, various coverage and ratio analysis, and peer institution analysis, to evaluate the relevance of the underlying drivers used to determine the overall ACL, which included the qualitative adjustment for macroeconomic uncertainties.

FIRST HAWAIIAN, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
​
​
1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
​
Basis of Presentation
​
First Hawaiian, Inc. (“FHI” or the “Parent”), a bank holding company, owns 
100
% of the outstanding common stock of First Hawaiian Bank (“FHB” or the “Bank”). FHB is a state-chartered bank that is not a member of the Federal Reserve System. FHB, the oldest financial institution in Hawaii, was established as Bishop & Company in 1858. As of December 31, 2024, FHB was the largest bank in Hawaii in terms of total assets, loans and leases, and net income. FHB has 
48
 branches located throughout the State of Hawaii, Guam and Saipan, and offers a comprehensive suite of banking services to consumer and commercial customers including loans, deposit products, wealth management, insurance, trust, retirement planning, credit card and merchant processing services.
​
The accounting and reporting principles of First Hawaiian, Inc. and Subsidiary (the “Company”) conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and prevailing practices within the financial services industry. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
​
Transition to an Independent Public Company
​
Prior to FHI’s initial public offering in August 2016 (“IPO”), the Company was an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BNP Paribas (“BNPP”), a global financial institution based in France.
On April 1, 2016, BNPP effected a series of transactions (“Reorganization Transactions”) pursuant to which FHI, which was then known as BancWest Corporation (“BancWest”), contributed Bank of the West (“BOW”), its subsidiary at the time, to BancWest Holding Inc. (“BWHI”), a newly formed bank holding company and a wholly owned subsidiary of BancWest. Following the contribution of BOW to BWHI, BancWest distributed its interest in BWHI to BNPP, and BWHI became a wholly owned subsidiary of BNPP. As part of these transactions, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to change its name to First Hawaiian, Inc., with First Hawaiian Bank remaining its only direct wholly owned subsidiary. 
On July 1, 2016, the Company became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of BNP Paribas USA, Inc. (“BNP Paribas USA”), BNPP’s U.S. intermediate holding company. As part of that reorganization, the Company became a direct wholly owned subsidiary of BancWest Corporation (“BWC”), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of BNP Paribas USA.
In August 2016, FHI completed its IPO and shares of FHI’s common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the ticker symbol “FHB” on August 4, 2016. 
In 2017, 2018 and 2019, BNPP, acting through BWC, sold all of the shares of FHI common stock that it beneficially owned in underwritten public offerings and share repurchases by the Company. FHI did 
no
t receive any of the proceeds from the sales of shares of FHI common stock in any such offering or the IPO. As a result of the completion of the February 1, 2019 public offering, BNPP (through BWC, the selling stockholder) 
fully
 exited its ownership interest in FHI common stock.
​
Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements
​
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events, actual results may differ from these estimates.
​

Table of Contents
Variable Interest Entities
​
A variable interest entity (“VIE”) is a legal entity that lacks the ability to financially support its activities or whose equity investors lack the ability to control its activities or absorb profits and losses proportionately with their investment in the entity. The primary beneficiary consolidates the VIE. The primary beneficiary is defined as the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE. 
​
The Company has a limited partnership interest or is a member in a limited liability company (“LLC”) in several low-income housing partnerships. These partnerships or LLCs provide funds for the construction and operation of apartment complexes that provide affordable housing to that segment of the population with lower family income. If these developments successfully attract a specified percentage of residents falling in that lower income range, state and/or federal income tax credits are made available to the partners or members. The tax credits are generally recognized over 5 or 10 years. In order to continue receiving the tax credits each year over the life of the partnership or LLC, the low-income residency targets must be maintained. 
​
The Company generally accounts for its interests in these low-income housing partnerships using the proportional amortization method. The Company’s investments in these partnership interests are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Unfunded commitments to fund these investments are unconditional and legally binding and are recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 
​
These low-income housing partnership and LLC entities meet the definition of a VIE; however, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the entities, as the general partner or managing member has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entities and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the entities. While the partnership or LLC agreements allow the limited partners and members, through a majority vote, to remove the general partner or managing member, this right is not deemed to be substantive as the general partner or managing member can only be removed for cause. 
​
Cash and Due from Banks
​
Cash and due from banks include amounts due from other financial institutions as well as in-transit clearings. Because amounts due from other financial institutions often exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) deposit insurance limit, the Company evaluates the credit risk of these institutions through periodic review of their financial condition and regulatory capital position. Under the terms of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act, the Company is required to maintain reserves with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (“FRB”) based on the amount of deposits held. Reserve requirements for all depository institutions were eliminated in March 2020. Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits in other banks. All amounts are readily convertible to cash and have original maturities of less than 90 days. 
​
Interest-bearing Deposits in Other Banks
​
Interest-bearing deposits in other banks include funds held in other financial institutions that are either fixed or variable rate instruments, including certificates of deposits. Interest income is recorded when earned and presented within other interest income in the Company’s consolidated statements of income.
​
Investment Securities
​
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, investment securities were comprised primarily of debt securities, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by the U.S. Government, its agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, with under 
5
% of the investment securities comprised of collateralized loan obligations rated AA or better and obligations issued by local state and political subdivisions rated AA or better. The Company amortizes premiums and accretes discounts using the interest method over the expected lives of the individual securities. Premiums on callable debt securities are amortized to their next call date. All investment securities transactions are recorded on a trade-date basis. 
​
100

Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s investment securities were categorized as either available-for-sale (investment securities that may be sold before maturity at the discretion of management) or held-to-maturity (investment securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity). Available-for-sale investment securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses realized on sales of available-for-sale investment securities are determined using the specific identification method. Held-to-maturity investment securities

are reported at amortized cost and may have a realized gain or loss if the investment security is retired or redeemed before the original maturity date.
​
Transfers of debt securities from the available-for-sale category to the held-to-maturity category are made at fair value at the date of transfer. The unrealized holding gain or loss at the date of transfer remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and in the carrying value of the held-to-maturity investment security. Premiums or discounts on investment securities are amortized or accreted as an adjustment of yield using the interest method over the expected life of the security. Unrealized holding gains or losses that remain in accumulated other comprehensive income are also amortized or accreted over the expected life of the security as an adjustment of yield, offsetting the related amortization of the premium or accretion of the discount.
​
For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company first assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For available-for-sale debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the Company evaluates at the individual security level whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors. In making this assessment, management considers the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security is compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income.
​
For held-to-maturity debt securities, the Company utilizes the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) approach to estimate lifetime expected credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of held-to-maturity debt securities to present the net amount expected to be collected from held-to-maturity debt securities.
​
Changes in the allowance for credit losses, if any, are recorded as a provision for (or reversal of) credit losses. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the available-for-sale or held-to-maturity investment security is deemed uncollectible or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell an available-for-sale investment security is met. Recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities were comprised primarily of debt securities, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by the U.S. Government, its agencies and government-sponsored enterprises. Management has concluded that the long history with no credit losses from these issuers indicates an expectation that nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is zero, and these securities are explicitly or implicitly fully guaranteed by the U.S. government. The U.S. government can print its own currency and its currency is routinely held by central banks and other major financial institutions. The dollar is used in international commerce, and commonly is viewed as a reserve currency, all of which qualitatively indicates that historical credit loss information should be minimally affected by current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Under 
5
% of the investment securities were comprised of collateralized loan obligations rated AA or better and obligations issued by local state and political subdivisions rated AA or better. These securities are investment grade and highly rated and carry either sufficient credit enhancement or days cash on hand to support timely payments of principal and interest. As a result, the Company does 
no
t expect any future payment defaults and has 
no
t recorded an allowance for credit losses for its available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
​
Accrued interest receivable related to available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities are recorded separately from the amortized cost basis of investment securities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.
​
101

Table of Contents
Loans Held for Sale
​
The Company originates certain loans for individual sale or for sale as a pool of loans to government-sponsored enterprises. Loans held for sale are carried, on an aggregate basis, at the lower of cost or fair value. The fair value of loans held for sale is primarily determined based on quoted prices for similar loans in active markets. Net gains and losses on loan sales are recorded as a component of other noninterest income. Direct loan origination costs and fees are deferred at origination of the loan and are recognized in other noninterest income upon sale of the loan.
​
Loans and Leases
​
Loans are reported at amortized cost, which includes the principal amount outstanding net of unamortized and unaccreted deferred loan fees and costs, and cumulative net charge-offs. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. Loan origination fees, certain direct costs and unearned discounts and premiums, if any, are deferred and are generally accreted or amortized into interest income as yield adjustments using the interest method over the contractual life of the loan. Other credit-related fees are recognized as fee income, a component of noninterest income, when earned. 
​
Direct financing leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of leased property, less unearned income. Unearned income on direct financing leases is amortized over the lease term by methods that approximate the interest method. Residual values on leased assets are periodically reviewed for impairment.
​
Accrued interest receivable related to loans and leases is recorded separately from the amortized cost basis of loans and leases on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.
​
Nonaccrual Loans and Leases
​
The Company generally places a loan or lease on nonaccrual status when management believes that collection of principal or interest has become doubtful or when a loan or lease becomes 90 days past due as to principal or interest, unless it is well secured and in the process of collection. A full or partial charge-off is recorded in the period in which the loan or lease is deemed uncollectible. When the Company places a loan or lease on nonaccrual status, previously accrued and uncollected interest is concurrently reversed against interest income. When the Company receives an interest payment on a nonaccrual loan or lease, the payment is applied as a reduction of the principal balance. Nonaccrual loans and leases are generally returned to accrual status when they become current as to principal and interest and future payments are reasonably assured.
​
Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
​
Loan modifications are assessed by the Company to determine: (1) whether the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and (2) whether the Company granted the borrower a modification or combination of modifications in the form of one or more of the following modification types: principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay and/or a term extension. If both criteria are met, then the loan modification is subject to additional evaluation for credit losses and enhanced disclosure requirements. 
​
Generally, a non-accrual loan that has been modified with a borrower experiencing financial difficulty remains on nonaccrual status for at least 
six months
 to demonstrate that the borrower is able to meet the terms of the modified loan. However, performance prior to the modification, or significant events that coincide with the modification, are included in assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and may result in the loan being returned to accrual status at the time of loan modification or after a shorter performance period. If the borrower’s ability to meet the revised payment terms is uncertain, the loan remains on non-accrual status.

​
Allowance for Credit Losses
​
The allowance for credit losses for loans and leases (the “ACL”) is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans and leases to present the net amount expected to be collected from loans and leases. Loans and leases are charged-off against the ACL when management believes the loan or lease balance is deemed uncollectible. Recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off. The Company’s ACL and the reserve for unfunded commitments under the CECL approach consist of quantitative and qualitative estimates. The Company’s methodology leverages two quantitative models: a multi-variable forward-looking macroeconomic model that estimates the impact of management’s economic outlook and a transition probability matrix that estimates expected losses over the long run. The quantitative estimation is overlaid with qualitative adjustments to account for current conditions and forward-looking factors not captured in the quantitative model. Qualitative adjustments that are considered include adjustments for macroeconomic factors, regulatory determinants, model limitations, and other current or anticipated events that are not captured in the Company’s historical loss experience.
​
The Company generally evaluates loans and leases on a collective or pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. However, loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Such loans and leases evaluated individually are excluded from the collective evaluation. Individually assessed loans are measured for estimated credit loss (“ECL”) based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral, less estimated selling costs, if the loan is collateral-dependent.
​
Management reviews relevant available information, from internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts about the future. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Adjustments to historical loss information may be made for differences in current loan-specific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards, portfolio mix, delinquency levels, or term as well as for changes in environmental conditions, such as changes in unemployment rates, property values, or other relevant factors.
​
The Company utilizes a Probability of Default (“PD”)/Loss Given Default (“LGD”) framework to estimate the ACL and the reserve for unfunded commitments on all portfolios except single family residential. The PD represents the percentage expectation to default, measured by assessing loans and leases that migrate to default status (i.e., nonaccrual status, 90 days or more past due, partial or full charge-offs or bankruptcy). LGD is defined as the percentage of the exposure at default (“EAD”) lost at the time of default, net of any recoveries, and will be unique to each of the collateral types securing the Company’s loans. PD and LGD’s are based on past experience of the Company. The ECL on loans and leases is calculated by taking the product of the credit exposure, lifetime default probability (“LDP”) and the LGD. For the single family residential portfolio, the Company utilizes a similar framework using Loss Probability (the likelihood a borrower’s asset will be charged-off) instead of PD, and Loss Severity (the share of an asset, expressed as a percent of the asset, that is a loss when a borrower’s asset is charged-off) instead of LGD.
​
The ECL model is applied to current credit exposures at the account level, using assumptions calibrated at the portfolio segment level using internal historical loan and lease data. The Company estimates the default risk of a credit exposure over the remaining life of each account using a transition probability matrix approach which captures both the average rate of up/down-grade and default/loss transitions, as well as withdrawal rates which capture the historical rate of exposure decline due to loan and lease amortization and prepayment. To apply the transition matrices, each credit exposure’s remaining life is split into two time-segments. The first time-segment is for the reasonable and supportable forecast period over which the transition matrices which are applied have been adjusted to incorporate current and forecasted conditions over that period. Management has determined that using a 
one-year
 time horizon for the reasonable and supportable forecast period for all classes of loans and leases is a reasonable forecast horizon given the difficulty in predicting future economic conditions with a high degree of certainty. The second time-segment is from the end of the reasonable and supportable forecast period to the maturity of the exposure, over which long-run average transition matrices are applied. Management elected to use an immediate reversion to the mean approach. Lifetime loss rates are applied against the amortized cost basis of loans and leases and unfunded commitments to estimate the ACL and the reserve for unfunded commitments, respectively.

​
On at least a quarterly basis, management convenes the Bank’s forecasting team which is responsible for reviewing the economic forecast model inputs and outputs and approving the resulting economic adjustment. The model uses a multi-variable econometric model to produce factors that modify the long-run default/loss rate assumptions used in the CECL model. These factors are applied to calculate the economic adjustment over the Reasonable and Supportable Forecast Period.  At the meeting, management is presented with the economic forecast model input and output as well as the resulting economic adjustment. 
​
The economic forecast framework allows management to use judgment in selecting the economic model input in cases where management’s outlook diverges from the official forecasts, and to apply qualitative dollar overlays to account for other economic related conditions not captured in the economic forecast model but are expected to potentially impact losses.
​
To inform the qualitative overlay, the team reviews other relevant economic variables and economic factors at the time of the meeting that could potentially impact future losses. These materials are presented to the economic forecasting team as they are economic in nature. If determined to be relevant and needing to be considered in the ACL estimate, these risks will be accounted for in the ACL estimate through a qualitative dollar overlay that is determined using either quantitative analysis or qualitative judgment, or a mix of both. These other factors could include inflation indicators, personal income, or visitor arrivals, for example.
​
The Company has identified 
three
 portfolio segments in estimating the ACL: commercial, residential real estate and consumer lending. The Company’s commercial portfolio segment is comprised of 
four
 distinct classes: commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, construction loans and lease financing. The key risk drivers related to this portfolio segment include risk rating, collateral type, and remaining maturity. The Company’s residential real estate portfolio segment is comprised of 
two
 distinct classes: residential real estate loans and home equity lines of credit. Specific risk characteristics related to this portfolio include the value of the underlying collateral, credit score and remaining maturity. Finally, the Company’s consumer portfolio segment is not further segmented, but consists primarily of automobile loans, credit cards and other installment loans.  Automobile loans constitute the majority of this segment and are monitored using credit scores, collateral values and remaining maturity. The remainder of the consumer portfolio is predominantly unsecured.
​
Regarding accrued interest receivable, the Company made accounting policy elections to (1) not measure an ACL on accrued interest receivable, (2) write-off accrued interest receivable by reversing interest income and (3) present accrued interest receivable separately from the related financial asset on the balance sheet. Furthermore, regarding collateral-dependent financial assets, the Company elected the practical expedient to use the fair value of collateral less estimated selling costs at the reporting date when recording the net carrying amount of the asset and determining the ACL for a financial asset for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty based on the Company’s assessment as of the reporting date.
​
Reserve for Unfunded Commitments
​
The Company estimates expected credit losses over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk via a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless that obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The reserve for unfunded commitments, which is a component of other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, is adjusted through the provision for credit losses. The estimate includes consideration of the likelihood that funding will occur and an estimate of expected credit losses on commitments expected to be funded over its estimated life.

​
Provision for Credit Losses
​
The provision for credit losses (the “Provision”) represents the amount charged against current period earnings to achieve an ACL and reserve for unfunded commitments that in management’s judgment is adequate to absorb expected credit losses related to the Company’s loan and lease portfolio and off-balance sheet credit exposures. Accordingly, the Provision will vary from period to period based on management’s ongoing assessment of the overall adequacy of the ACL and reserve for unfunded commitments.

Table of Contents
Premises and Equipment
​
Premises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of 
7
 to 
39 years
 for premises, 
3
 to 
20 years
 for equipment and the shorter of the lease term or remaining useful life for leasehold improvements.
​
On a periodic basis, long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset exceeds its fair value and is not recoverable. An impairment analysis is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.
​
Operating lease rental income for leased assets, primarily premises, is recognized on a straight-line basis as an offset to rental expense.
​
Other Real Estate Owned and Repossessed Personal Property
​
Other real estate owned (“OREO”) and repossessed personal property are comprised primarily of properties that the Company acquires through foreclosure proceedings. The Company values these properties at fair value less estimated costs to sell the property upon acquisition, which establishes the new carrying value. The Company charges losses arising upon the acquisition of the property against the ACL. If the fair value of the property at the time of acquisition exceeds the carrying amount of the loan, the excess is recorded as a recovery of previous amounts written off to the ACL and then as a gain on initial transfer in other noninterest income thereafter. After acquisition, the Company carries such properties at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs on a nonrecurring basis. Any write-downs or losses from the subsequent disposition of such properties are included in other noninterest income. Gains recognized on the sale of such properties are included in other noninterest income.
​
Bank-Owned Life Insurance
​
The Company purchases life insurance policies on the lives of certain officers and employees and is the owner and beneficiary of these policies. Bank-owned life insurance is recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at its cash surrender value (“CSV”). Changes in the CSV and any death benefits received in excess of the CSV are recognized as noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income.  
​
Goodwill
​
Goodwill represents the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. The Company performs impairment testing of goodwill, an indefinite-lived intangible asset, as required under GAAP on an annual basis in the fourth quarter or when circumstances change that indicate that a potential impairment may have occurred. The Company has assigned goodwill to its operating segments for impairment testing purposes. The goodwill impairment guidance provides the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing further impairment tests is unnecessary. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, or does not elect this option, it is required to perform impairment testing. The quantitative impairment test identifies potential impairments at the reporting unit level by comparing the estimated fair value of each identified reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, there is no impairment of goodwill. However, if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment exists, and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment are prohibited.
​
Mortgage Servicing Rights
​
Mortgage servicing rights are recognized as assets when residential mortgage loans are sold and the rights to service those loans are retained.  Mortgage servicing rights are initially recorded at fair value by using a discounted cash flow model to calculate the present value of estimated future net servicing income, incorporating assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value.
105

Table of Contents
​
The Company’s mortgage servicing rights are accounted for under the amortization method and periodically assessed for impairment. The Company amortizes the mortgage servicing rights over the period of estimated net servicing income, taking into account prepayment assumptions. Any such indicated impairment is recognized in earnings during the period in which the impairment occurs. Mortgage servicing income, net of the amortization of mortgage servicing rights, is recorded as a component of other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income. 
​
Non-Marketable Equity Securities
​
The Company is required to own Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Des Moines stock as a condition of membership. These securities are accounted for under the cost method, which equals par value, and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. These securities do not have a readily determinable fair value as ownership is restricted and there is no market for these securities. The Company reviews these securities periodically for impairment. Management considers these securities to be long-term investments. Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. 
No
 impairment was recognized on non-marketable equity securities for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
​
Internal-Use Software
​
Capitalized internal-use software, stated at cost less accumulated amortization, includes purchased software and capitalizable application development costs associated with internally developed software. Capitalized internal-use software is included as a component of other assets, net of accumulated amortization, on the consolidated balance sheets. Amortization expense is computed on a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, generally up to 
five years
.
​
The Company also enters in the ordinary course of business into technology-related hosting arrangements that are service contracts. These arrangements can include capitalizable implementation costs that are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the hosting arrangement. Capitalized implementation costs associated with hosting arrangements that are service contracts are included as a component of other assets, net of accumulated amortization, on the consolidated balance sheets.
​
Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
​
The Company has a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, an unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan, a directors’ retirement plan, a non-qualified pension plan for eligible directors and a postretirement benefit plan providing life insurance and healthcare benefits that is offered to directors and employees, as applicable. The qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, the unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan and the directors’ retirement plan are all frozen plans to new participants. To calculate annual pension costs, management uses the following key variables: (1) size of the employee population, length of service and estimated compensation increases; (2) actuarial assumptions and estimates; (3) expected long-term rate of return on plan assets; and (4) discount rate. For all pension and postretirement benefit plan calculations, the Company uses a December 31
st
 measurement date.
​
The expected long-term rate of return was based on a calculated rate of return from average rates of return on various asset classes over a 
20-year
 historical time horizon. Using long-term historical data allows the Company to capture multiple economic environments, which management believes is relevant when using historical returns. Net actuarial gains or losses that exceed a 
5
% corridor of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year are amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic pension cost on a straight-line basis over 
five years
. 
​
In estimating the projected benefit obligation, an independent actuary bases assumptions on factors such as mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate, disability rate and other assumptions related to the population of individuals in the pension plan. If significant actuarial gains or losses occur, the actuary reviews the demographic and economic assumptions with management, at which time the Company considers revising these assumptions based on actual results.
​
106

Table of Contents
The Company recognizes an asset on its consolidated balance sheets for a plan’s overfunded status or a liability for a plan’s underfunded status. The Company also measures the plans’ assets and obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the year and recognizes those changes in other comprehensive income, net of tax. Periodic pension expense (or income) includes service costs, interest costs based on the assumed discount rate, the expected return on plan assets based on an actuarially derived market-related value and amortization of actuarial gains and losses. Service cost is included in salaries and employee benefits expense, while all other components of net periodic pension cost are included in other noninterest expense in the consolidated statements of income.
​
Income Taxes
​
Current income tax expense is recognized for the amount of income taxes expected to be payable or refundable for the current period, and deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the corresponding tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred income taxes are calculated by applying enacted statutory tax rates and tax laws to future years in which temporary differences are expected to reverse. The impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that the tax rate change is enacted. A deferred tax valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Interest and penalties, if any, expected to be assessed or refunded by taxing authorities relating to an underpayment or overpayment of income taxes are accrued and recorded as part of income tax expense.
​
Excise tax credits relating to premises and equipment are accounted for using the flow-through method, and the benefit is recognized in the year the asset is placed in service. General business and excise tax credits generated from the leasing portfolio, except for credits that are passed on to lessees, are recognized over the term of the lease for book purposes, but in the year placed in service for tax purposes.
​
The Company maintains reserves for unrecognized tax benefits that arise in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2024, these positions were evaluated based on an assessment of probabilities as to the likelihood of whether a liability had been incurred. Such assessments are reviewed as events occur and adjustments to the reserves are made as appropriate. In evaluating a tax position for recognition, the Company evaluates whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. If the tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, the tax position is measured and recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as the largest amount of tax benefit that, in management’s judgment, is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. 
​
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
​
Derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. On the date the Company enters into a derivative contract, the Company designates the derivative instrument as: (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (“fair value hedge”); (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow hedge”); or (3) held for trading, customer accommodation or not qualifying for hedge accounting (“free-standing derivative instrument”). 
​
For a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment attributable to interest rate risk are recorded in current period earnings. For a cash flow hedge, to the extent that the hedge is considered highly effective, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recorded in other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified to net income in the same period that the hedged transaction impacts net income. For free-standing derivative instruments, changes in fair values are reported in current period earnings. 
​
The Company formally documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivative instruments that are designated as hedges to specific assets or liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at the inception of a hedge and on a quarterly basis, whether the derivative instruments used are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values of, or cash flows related to, hedged items.
​

Fair Value Measurements
​
Fair value measurements apply whenever GAAP requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value either on a recurring or nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is based on the assumptions that management believes market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability. Fair value measurement and disclosure guidance established a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation methodologies. Management maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value measurements.
​
Stock-Based Compensation
​
The Company grants stock-based awards, including restricted stock, restricted shares, performance share units, performance shares and restricted stock units. These awards are issued at no cost to the recipient. The fair value of restricted stock, restricted shares and restricted stock unit awards was based on the closing price of FHI’s common stock on the date of grant. Such awards were recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Recipients of performance shares and performance share units are entitled to receive shares of FHI common stock at no cost, subject to the Company’s achievement of specified market or performance conditions. The grant date fair value of the performance share units subject to the Company’s achievement of specified market conditions was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. For purposes of this modeling exercise, historical volatilities of FHI common stock and members of the peer group were used. The risk-free interest rate that was used in the valuation was that of a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury note that was commensurate with the performance period. The grant date fair value of the performance share units and performance shares subject to the Company’s achievement of performance conditions was based on the closing price of FHI’s common stock on the date of grant. Forfeitures of stock-based awards are recognized as they occur.
​
As compensation cost is recognized, a deferred tax asset is established which represents an estimate of the future tax deduction from the release of restrictions or the achievement of performance targets. At the time that restrictions on the stock-based awards are released, the Company may be required to recognize an adjustment to income tax expense, depending on the market price of the Company’s common stock at that time.
​
Treasury Stock
​
Shares of the Parent’s common stock that were repurchased or that are used to satisfy payroll tax withholdings related to stock-based compensation are recorded in treasury stock at cost. On the date of subsequent reissuance, the treasury stock account will be reduced by the cost of such stock on a first-in, first-out basis.
​
Earnings per Share
​
Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period, assuming conversion of potentially dilutive common stock equivalents.
​
Advertising and Marketing Costs
​
Advertising and marketing costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising and marketing costs were $
7.7
 million, $
7.6
 million, and $
8.0
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Accounting Standards Adopted in 2024
​
In March 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-01, 
Leases (Topic 842), Common Control Arrangements
. This update clarifies the accounting for leasehold improvements associated with common control leases. Prior to this update, Topic 842 generally required leasehold improvements to have an amortization period consistent with the shorter of the useful life of those improvements or the remaining lease term. This update will require leasehold improvements associated with common control leases to be (1) amortized by the lessee over the useful life of the leasehold improvements to the common control group (regardless of the lease term) as long as the lessee controls the use of the underlying asset (the leased asset) through a lease, and (2) accounted for as a transfer between entities under common control through an adjustment to equity if, and when, the lessee no longer controls the use of the underlying asset. In addition, this update also subjects leasehold improvements to the impairment guidance in Topic 360, 
Property, Plant, and Equipment
. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2023-01 on January 1, 2024, and it did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
​
In March 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-02, 
Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method
. This update expands the population of tax equity investments for which a reporting entity may elect to apply the proportional amortization method (“PAM”). Under legacy guidance, an entity can only elect to apply the PAM to investments in low-income housing tax credit (“LIHTC”) structures. This update permits an entity to make an election to account for tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the PAM if certain conditions are met. An accounting policy election is made to apply the PAM on a tax credit program-by-program basis rather than electing to apply the PAM at the reporting entity level or to individual investments. By applying the PAM, a reporting entity must account for the receipt of the investment tax credits using the flow-through method under Topic 740, 
Income Taxes
, even if the entity applies the deferral method for other investment tax credits received. For all tax equity investments accounted for using the PAM, this update also requires the use of the delayed equity contribution guidance. LIHTC investments not accounted for using the PAM will no longer be permitted to use the delayed equity contribution guidance. In addition, LIHTC investments accounted for using the equity method must apply the impairment guidance in Subtopic 323-10, 
Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures—Overall
. Further, LIHTC investments that are not accounted for using the PAM or the equity method must use the guidance in Topic 321, 
Investments—Equity Securities
, when accounting for equity investments. In addition, the amendments in this update require specific disclosures that must be applied to all investments that generate income tax credits and other income tax benefits from a tax credit program for which the entity has elected to apply the PAM, including investments within that elected program that do not meet the conditions to apply the PAM. Such disclosures include the nature of its tax equity investments and the effect of such investments and related income tax credits and other income tax benefits on its financial position and results of operations. The Company adopted the provisions of ASU No. 2023-02 on January 1, 2024, and it did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. See “Note 7. Other Assets” for required disclosures related to this new guidance.
​
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, 
Segment Reporting (Topic 280), Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
. This update improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments will require public entities to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) and included within segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items to reconcile to segment profit or loss, and the title and position of the entity’s CODM. In addition, the amendments clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple measures of segment profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and expand interim disclosure requirements. The purpose of the amendments is to enable investors to better understand an entity’s overall performance and assess potential future cash flows. The amendments are effective for the Company’s annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2024 and interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning January 1, 2025, and requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company presented the newly required annual disclosures in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company adopted the amendments related to interim disclosure requirements effective January 1, 2025, and will present any newly required interim disclosures beginning with its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2025. The adoption of the provisions of ASU No. 2023-07 enhanced the Company’s disclosures in its Reportable Operating Segments footnote but did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. See “Note 22. Reportable Operating Segments” for required disclosures related to this new guidance.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
​
The following ASUs have been issued by the FASB and are applicable to the Company in future reporting periods.
​
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740), Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
. This update includes amendments that further enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures, primarily through standardizing and disaggregating rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. This update is effective for the Company’s annual periods beginning January 1, 2025. The Company adopted the amendments of ASU No. 2023-09 effective January 1, 2025, and will include the required disclosures in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2025. The adoption of the provisions of ASU No. 2023-09 will impact the Company’s disclosures in its Income Taxes footnote but did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
​
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, 
Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
. This ASU requires public companies to disclose, in the notes to financial statements, specified information about certain costs and expenses at each interim and annual reporting period which include, for example, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization. In addition, certain expense amounts already required to be disclosed under current GAAP will need to be presented within the same disclosure as the other disaggregation requirements prescribed by this ASU. Public entities will also be required to disclose: (1) a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively and (2) the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses. The FASB also issued ASU No. 2025-01 in January 2025 to clarify that the effective date of ASU No. 2024-03 for public entities is for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Further, ASU No. 2024-03 is applied prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods beginning after the effective date, meaning that the disclosures required under ASU No. 2024-03 do not need to be included in the financial statements for reporting periods beginning before the effective date that are presented for comparative purposes. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact that this new guidance may have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
​
2. Transactions with Related Parties
​
In the normal course of business, the Company makes loans to executive officers and directors of the Company and its subsidiary. These loans are made on terms no less favorable to the Company than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated persons or, in the case of certain residential real estate loans, on terms that are widely available to employees of the Company who are not directors or executive officers.
​
Changes in the loans to such executive officers and directors during 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:

3. Investment Securities
​
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, investment securities consisted predominantly of the following investment categories:
​
U.S. Treasury and debt securities

– includes U.S. Treasury notes and debt securities issued by government-sponsored enterprises.
​
110

Table of Contents
Mortgage-backed securities

– includes securities backed by notes or receivables secured by mortgage assets with cash flows based on actual or scheduled payments.
​
Collateralized mortgage

obligations

– includes securities backed by a pool of mortgages with cash flows distributed based on certain rules rather than pass through payments.
​
Collateralized loan

obligations

– includes structured debt securities backed by a pool of loans, consisting of primarily non-investment grade broadly syndicated corporate loans with additional credit enhancement. These are floating rate securities that have an investment grade rating of AA or better.
​
Debt securities issued by states and political subdivisions

– includes general obligation bonds issued by state and local governments.

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did 
no
t have any available-for-sale securities with the intent to sell and determined it was more likely than not that the Company would not be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. As the Company had the intent and ability to hold the remaining available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, each security with an unrealized loss position in the above tables has been further assessed to determine if a credit loss exists. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not expect any credit losses in its available-for-sale debt securities and 
no
 credit losses were recognized on available-for-sale securities during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Table of Contents
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s investment securities were comprised primarily of debt securities, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by the U.S. Government, its agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, with under 
5
% of the investment securities comprised of collateralized loan obligations rated AA or better and obligations issued by local state and political subdivisions rated AA or better. For investment securities issued by the U.S. Government, its agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, management has concluded that the long history with no credit losses from these issuers indicates an expectation that nonpayment of the amortized cost basis is zero, and these securities are explicitly or implicitly fully guaranteed by the U.S. government. The U.S. government can print its own currency and its currency is routinely held by central banks and other major financial institutions. The dollar is used in international commerce, and commonly is viewed as a reserve currency, all of which qualitatively indicates that historical credit loss information should be minimally affected by current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. For collateralized loan obligations and debt securities issued by local state and political subdivisions, these securities are investment grade and highly rated and carry either sufficient credit enhancement or days cash on hand to support timely payments of principal and interest. As a result, the Company does not expect any future payment defaults and has 
no
t recorded an allowance for credit losses for its available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt securities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. 
​
In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a $
40.8
 million net realized gain related to the sale of approximately 
120,000
 Visa Class B restricted shares. The Company did 
no
t hold any Visa Class B restricted shares as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Table of Contents
In the course of evaluating the credit risk presented by a customer and the pricing that will adequately compensate the Company for assuming that risk, management may require a certain amount of collateral support. The type of collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, land, buildings, equipment, income-producing commercial properties and residential real estate. The Company applies the same collateral policy for loans whether they are funded immediately or on a delayed basis. The loan and lease portfolio is principally located in Hawaii and, to a lesser extent, on the U.S. Mainland, Guam and Saipan. The risk inherent in the portfolio depends upon both the economic stability of the state or territories, which affects property values, and the financial strength and creditworthiness of the borrowers.
​
5. Allowance for Credit Losses
​
The Company maintains the allowance for credit losses for loans and leases (the “ACL”) that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of loans and leases to present the net carrying value of loans and leases expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount of loans and leases. While management utilizes its best judgment and information available, the ultimate appropriateness of the ACL is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control, including the performance of our loan portfolio, the economy, changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications.
​
The Company also maintains an estimated reserve for unfunded commitments on the consolidated balance sheets. The reserve for unfunded commitments is reduced in the period in which the off-balance sheet financial instruments expire, loan funding occurs, or is otherwise settled.
​
During the second quarter of 2024, the Company updated its methodology for one of its quantitative models to estimate the total ACL (inclusive of the allowance for credit losses for loans and leases and the reserve for unfunded commitments) by changing from a one-variable forward-looking macroeconomic outlook model to a multi-variable forward-looking macroeconomic outlook model. The impact of this update was a reduction to the total ACL of $
9.0
 million as of June 30, 2024. Additionally, the Company updated certain components of its qualitative adjustments, resulting in a $
5.8
 million increase to the total ACL as of June 30, 2024. The net impact of these updates was a net $
3.2
 million decrease to the total ACL as of June 30, 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company also changed its framework for the single family residential portfolio to utilize a Loss Probability/Loss Severity framework (previously a Probability of Default/Loss Given Default framework). The impact of this change resulted in a $
0.6
 million decrease to the total ACL as of December 31, 2024. The Company’s methodology is more fully described in Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.

Credit Quality Information
​
The Company performs an internal loan review and grading or scoring procedures on an ongoing basis. The review provides management with periodic information as to the quality of the loan portfolio and effectiveness of the Company’s lending policies and procedures. The objective of the loan review and grading or scoring procedures is to identify, in a timely manner, existing or emerging credit quality issues so that appropriate steps can be initiated to avoid or minimize future losses.
​
Loans and leases subject to grading primarily include: commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, construction loans and lease financing. Other loans subject to grading include installment loans to businesses or individuals for business and commercial purposes, overdraft lines of credit, commercial credit cards, and other credits as may be determined. Credit quality indicators for internally graded loans and leases are generally updated on an annual basis or on a quarterly basis for those loans and leases deemed to be of potentially higher risk.
​
117

Table of Contents
An internal credit risk rating system is used to determine loan grade and is based on borrower credit risk and transactional risk. The loan grading process is a mechanism used to determine the risk of a particular borrower and is based on the following factors of a borrower: character, earnings and operating cash flow, asset and liability structure, debt capacity, management and controls, borrowing entity, and industry and operating environment.
​
Pass
 – “Pass” (uncriticized) loans and leases are not considered to carry greater than normal risk. The borrower has the apparent ability to satisfy obligations to the Company, and therefore no loss in ultimate collection is anticipated.
​
Special Mention
 – Loans and leases that have potential weaknesses that deserves management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for assets or in the institution’s credit position at some future date. Special mention assets are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.
​
Substandard
 – Loans and leases that are inadequately protected by the current financial condition and paying capacity of the obligor or by any collateral pledged. Loans and leases so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the collection of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank may sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
​
Doubtful
 – Loans and leases that have weaknesses found in substandard borrowers with the added provision that the weaknesses make collection of debt in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.
​
Loss
 – Loans and leases classified as loss are considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as an asset is not warranted. This classification does not mean that the loan or lease has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may be effected in the future. 
​
Loans that are primarily monitored for credit quality using FICO scores include: residential mortgage loans, home equity lines and consumer loans. FICO scores are calculated primarily based on a consideration of payment history, the current amount of debt, the length of credit history available, a recent history of new sources of credit and the mix of credit type. FICO scores are updated on a monthly, quarterly or bi-annual basis, depending on the product type.

Nonaccrual Loans and Leases
​
The Company generally places a loan or lease on nonaccrual status when management believes that collection of principal or interest has become doubtful or when a loan or lease becomes 90 days past due as to principal or interest, unless it is well secured and in the process of collection. The Company charges off a loan or lease when facts indicate that the loan or lease is considered uncollectible.
​
The amortized cost basis of loans and leases on nonaccrual status as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and the amortized cost basis of loans and leases on nonaccrual status with no allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized interest income of $
1.1
 million, $
0.6
 million and $
0.4
 million, respectively, on nonaccrual loans and leases. Furthermore, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the amount of accrued interest receivables written off by reversing interest income was $
1.1
 million, $
1.0
 million and $
0.9
 million, respectively.
​
Collateral-Dependent Loans and Leases
​
Collateral-dependent loans and leases are those for which repayment (on the basis of the Company’s assessment as of the reporting date) is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the amortized cost basis of collateral-dependent loans was $
39.1
 million and $
11.1
 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, these loans were primarily collateralized by residential real estate property and borrower assets and the fair value of collateral on substantially all collateral-dependent loans were significantly in excess of their amortized cost basis. As of December 31, 2023, these loans were primarily collateralized by residential real estate property and the fair value of collateral on substantially all collateral-dependent loans were significantly in excess of their amortized cost basis.
​
Loan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty
​
Commercial and industrial loans with a borrower experiencing financial difficulty may be modified through interest rate reductions, term extensions, and converting revolving credit lines to term loans. Modifications of commercial real estate and construction loans with a borrower experiencing financial difficulty may involve reducing the interest rate for the remaining term of the loan or extending the maturity date at an interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk. Modifications of construction loans with a borrower experiencing financial difficulty may also involve extending the interest-only payment period. Interest continues to accrue on the missed payments and as a result, the effective yield on the loan remains unchanged. Modifications of residential real estate loans with a borrower experiencing financial difficulty may be comprised of loans where monthly payments are lowered to accommodate the borrowers’ financial needs for a period of time, including extended interest-only periods and reamortization of the balance. Modifications of consumer loans with a borrower experiencing financial difficulty may involve interest rate reductions and term extensions. 
​
Loans modified with a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, whether in default or not, may already be on nonaccrual status and in some cases, partial charge-offs may have already been taken against the outstanding loan balance. Loans modified with a borrower experiencing financial difficulty are evaluated for impairment. As a result, this may have a financial effect of impacting the specific ACL associated with the loan. An ACL for impaired commercial loans, including commercial real estate and construction loans, is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate or if the loan is collateral-dependent, the estimated fair value of the collateral, less any selling costs. An ACL for impaired residential real estate loans is measured based on the estimated fair value of the collateral, less any selling costs. Management exercises significant judgment in developing these estimates.

Troubled Debt Restructuring Disclosures Prior to Adoption of ASU No. 2022-02
​
Prior to the adoption of ASU No. 2022-02, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), 
Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures,
 the Company accounted for a modification to the contractual terms of a loan that resulted in granting a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty as a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”). On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU No. 2022-02, which eliminated TDR accounting prospectively for all restructurings occurring on or after January 1, 2023. Loans that were restructured in a TDR prior to the adoption of ASU No. 2022-02 will continue to be accounted for under the historical TDR accounting until the loan is paid off or subsequently modified. The disclosures below related to TDRs for prior periods are presented in accordance with Subtopic 310-40, 
Receivables—Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors
.
​
Commercial and industrial loans modified in a TDR may have involved temporary interest-only payments, term extensions, and converting revolving credit lines to term loans. Modifications of commercial real estate and construction loans in a TDR may have involved reducing the interest rate for the remaining term of the loan, extending the maturity date at an interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk, or substituting or adding a new borrower or guarantor. Modifications of construction loans in a TDR may have also involved extending the interest-only payment period. Interest continued to accrue on the missed payments and as a result, the effective yield on the loan remained unchanged. Residential real estate loans modified in a TDR may have been comprised of loans where monthly payments were lowered to accommodate the borrowers’ financial needs for a period of time, including extended interest-only periods and reamortization of the balance. Modifications of consumer loans in a TDR may have involved temporary or permanent reduced payments, temporary interest-only payments and below-market interest rates.
​
Loans modified in a TDR may have already been on nonaccrual status and in some cases, partial charge-offs may have already been taken against the outstanding loan balance. Loans modified in a TDR were evaluated for impairment. As a result, this may have had a financial effect of impacting the specific ACL associated with the loan. An ACL for impaired commercial loans, including commercial real estate and construction loans, that had been modified in a TDR was measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or if the loan was collateral-dependent, the estimated fair value of the collateral, less any selling costs. An ACL for impaired residential real estate loans that had been modified in a TDR was measured based on the estimated fair value of the collateral, less any selling costs. Management exercised significant judgment in developing these estimates.

​
Other
​
Nonmarketable equity securities include FHLB stock, which the Company holds to meet regulatory requirements. As a member of the FHLB system, the Company is required to maintain a minimum level of investment in FHLB non-publicly traded stock based on specific percentages of the Company’s total assets and outstanding advances in accordance with the FHLB’s capital plan which may be amended or revised periodically. Amounts in excess of the required minimum may be transferred at par to another member institution subject to prior approval of the FHLB. Excess stock may also be sold to the FHLB subject to a 
five-year
 redemption notice period and at the sole discretion of the FHLB. These securities are accounted for under the cost method. These investments are considered long-term investments by management and accordingly, the ultimate recoverability of its par value is considered rather than considering temporary declines in value. The investment in FHLB stock was included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and was $
21.4
 million and $
32.6
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

8. Transfers of Financial Assets
​
The Company’s transfers of financial assets with continuing interest may include pledges of collateral to secure public deposits and repurchase agreements, FHLB and FRB borrowing capacity, automated clearing house (“ACH”) transactions and interest rate swaps. 
​
For public deposits and repurchase agreements, the Company enters into bilateral agreements with the entity to pledge investment securities as collateral in the event of default. The right of setoff for a repurchase agreement resembles a secured borrowing, whereby the collateral pledged by the Company would be used to settle the fair value of the repurchase agreement should the Company be in default. The counterparty has the right to sell or repledge the investment securities. The Company is required by the counterparty to maintain adequate collateral levels. In the event the collateral fair value falls below stipulated levels, the Company will pledge additional investment securities. For transfers of assets with the FHLB and the FRB, the Company enters into bilateral agreements to pledge loans and/or securities as collateral to secure borrowing capacity. For ACH transactions, the Company enters into bilateral agreements to collateralize possible daylight overdrafts. For interest rate swaps, the Company enters into bilateral agreements to pledge collateral when either party is in a negative fair value position to mitigate counterparty credit risk. Counterparties to ACH transactions, certain interest rate swaps, the FHLB and the FRB do not have the right to sell or repledge the collateral.
​
The carrying amounts of the assets pledged as collateral to secure public deposits, borrowing arrangements and other transactions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

The Company treats securities sold under agreements to repurchase as collateralized financings. The Company reflects the obligations to repurchase the same or similar securities sold as liabilities, with the dollar amount of securities underlying the agreements remaining in the asset accounts. Generally, for these types of agreements, there is a requirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount borrowed. As such, the collateral pledged may be increased or decreased over time to meet contractual obligations. The securities underlying the agreements to repurchase are held in collateral accounts with a third-party custodian. The Company did not enter into any repurchase agreements in 2024 and 2023.

As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not have any available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position with the intent to sell and determined it was not more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis. Thus, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, there was 
no
 incremental non-credit-related impairment loss recognized in earnings on these securities.
​
12. Regulatory Capital Requirements
​
Federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends the Company may declare or pay. The Company depends primarily on dividends from FHB as the source of funds for the Company’s payment of dividends.
​
135

Table of Contents
The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements imposed by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s and the Bank’s operating activities and financial condition. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets and certain off-balance-sheet items. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.
​
Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets, as well as a minimum leverage ratio.
​
The following provides definitions for the regulatory risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio, which are calculated as per standard regulatory guidance:
​
Risk-Weighted Assets
 — Assets are weighted for risk according to a formula used by the Federal Reserve to conform to capital adequacy guidelines. On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. The off-balance sheet items comprise a minimal part of the overall calculation.
​
Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio
 — The CET1 risk-based capital ratio is calculated as CET1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 is the sum of equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill as well as certain other comprehensive income items as follows: net unrealized gains/losses on securities and derivatives, and net unrealized pension and other benefit losses.
​
Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio
 — The Tier 1 capital ratio is calculated as Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.
​
Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio
 — The total risk-based capital ratio is calculated as the sum of Tier 1 capital and an allowable amount of the allowance for credit losses (limited to 
1.25
 percent of risk-weighted assets), divided by risk-weighted assets.
​
Tier 1 Leverage Ratio
 — The Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by adjusted quarterly average total assets.
​
The table below sets forth those ratios at December 31, 2024 and 2023:

Table of Contents
A 
2.5
% capital conservation buffer, comprised of CET1 capital, was established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) 
7
% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) 
8.5
% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and (iii) 
10.5
% total capital to risk-weighted assets. 
​
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950’s prompt corrective action provisions apply only to depository institutions such as the Bank, and not to bank holding companies. Under the Federal Reserve’s regulations, a bank holding company, such as FHI, is considered “well-capitalized” if the bank holding company (i) has a total risk based capital ratio of at least 10%, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6%, and (iii) is not subject to any written agreement order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. The Company meets all capital ratio requirements to be well-capitalized under the Federal Reserve’s regulations, and, although the prompt corrective action provisions apply only to depository institutions and not to bank holding companies, if the provisions applied to bank holding companies, the Company would meet all capital ratio requirements to be well-capitalized.
​
As of December 31, 2024, under the bank regulatory capital guidelines, the Company and Bank were both classified as well-capitalized and exceeded the aforementioned capital conservation buffer. Management is not aware of any conditions or events that have occurred since December 31, 2024, to change the capital adequacy category of the Company or the Bank.
​
In January 2025, the Company announced a stock repurchase program for up to $
100.0
 million of its outstanding common stock during 2025. The timing and exact amount of stock repurchases, if any, will be subject to management’s discretion and various factors, including the Company’s capital position and financial performance, as well as market conditions. The stock repurchase program may be suspended, terminated or modified at any time for any reason.
​
In 
January 2025
, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $
0.26
 per share on our outstanding shares. The dividend is to be paid on 
February 28, 2025
 to shareholders of record at the close of business on 
February 14, 2025
.
​
13. Leases
​
The Company, as lessee, is obligated under a number of noncancelable operating leases primarily for branch premises and related real estate. Terms of such leases extend for periods up to 
39 years
, many of which provide for periodic adjustment of rent payments based on changes in various economic indicators. Renewal 
options
 are included in the Company’s lease liabilities and related right-of-use assets to the extent that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise such options. For all of the Company’s short-term leases (i.e., leases with an initial term of 12 months or less), the Company recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.
​
The Company’s branch premises leases typically require that the Company is responsible to pay for variable lease expense, primarily maintenance expense, as well as real property taxes, property insurance and sales taxes. Maintenance expense is paid to maintain common areas and covers costs including landscaping, cleaning and general maintenance. Such variable costs are typically re-evaluated by the landlord on an annual basis and are charged to the Company based on the portion of the total building premises that is occupied by the Company.
​
The Company subleases certain premises and real estate to third parties. The sublease portfolio consists of operating leases for space connected with 
three
 of the Company’s branch properties.

​
The most significant assumption related to the Company’s application of Topic 842 was the discount rate assumption. As most of the Company’s lease agreements do not provide for an implicit interest rate, the Company used the collateralized interest rate that the Company would have to pay to borrow over a similar term to estimate the Company’s lease liabilities.

14. Benefit Plans
​
Qualified Pension Plan
​
The Company’s employees participate in the Employees’ Retirement Plan of First Hawaiian, Inc. (the “FHI ERP”). The FHI ERP is a frozen plan whereby there are 
no
 further benefit accruals for the Company’s employees. However, employees retain rights to participant benefits accrued as of the date of the plan freeze. 
​
No
 contributions to the pension trust are expected to be made during 2025 for the Company’s participants in the FHI ERP. However, should contributions be required in accordance with the funding rules under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), including the impact of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Company would make those required contributions.
​
Nonqualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans
​
The Company also sponsors an unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan for certain key executives (“SERP”). In addition, the Company sponsors a directors’ retirement plan (“Directors’ Plan”), a non-qualified pension plan for eligible FHI and FHB directors that qualify for retirement benefits based on their years of service as a director. Both the SERP and the Directors’ Plan were frozen as of January 1, 2005 to new participants. In March 2019, the Company’s board of directors approved an amendment to the SERP to freeze the SERP, which became effective on July 1, 2019. As a result of the amendment, since the effective date, there have not been any, and there will be 
no
, new accruals of benefits, including service accruals. Existing benefits under the SERP, as of the effective date of the amendment described above, will otherwise continue in accordance with the terms of the SERP.  
​

Table of Contents
A postretirement benefit plan is also offered to eligible employees that provides healthcare benefits upon retirement. The Company provides access to medical coverage for eligible retirees under age 65 at active employee premium rates and a monthly stipend to both retiree and retiree’s spouse after age 62. 
​
The Company expects to contribute $
0.2
 million to its Directors’ Plan and $
1.3
 million to its postretirement medical and life insurance plans in 2025. These contributions reflect the estimated benefit payments for the unfunded plans and may vary depending on retirements during 2025.
​
Defined Contribution Plans
​
401(k) Savings Plan and Money Purchase Pension Plan
​
The Company matched employee contributions to the First Hawaiian, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan, a qualified defined contribution plan, up to 
5
% of the employee’s pay in 2024, 2023 and 2022. The Company also contributed

The Company recognizes the overfunded and underfunded status of its pension plans as an asset and liability in the consolidated balance sheets.
​
Unrecognized net gains or losses that exceed 
5
% of the greater of the PBO or the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year are amortized on a straight-line basis over 
five years
 in accordance with ASC 715. Amortization of the unrecognized net gain or loss is included as a component of net periodic pension cost. If amortization results in an amount less than the minimum amortization required under GAAP, the minimum required amount is recorded.

​
The assets within the pension plan are managed in accordance with ERISA. The objective of the plan is to achieve, over full market cycles, a compounded annual rate of return equal to or greater than the pension plan’s expected long-term rate of return. The pension plan’s participants recognize that capital markets can be unpredictable and that any investment could result in periods where the market value of the pension plan’s assets will decline in value. Asset allocation is likely to be the primary determinant of the pension plan’s return and the associated volatility of returns for the pension plan. The Company estimated the long-term rate of return for the 2024 net periodic pension cost to be 
4.75
%. The return was selected based on a model of U.S. capital market assumptions with expected returns reflecting the anticipated asset allocation of the pension plan.

Net deferred income tax assets were included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
​
Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on sufficient taxable income being generated in the future and, although realization is not assured, the Company believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. However, if estimates of future taxable income decrease, a reduction to the amount of deferred tax assets considered realizable could result.

The Company is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and tax authorities in states in which the Company has significant business operations. The tax years under examination and open for examination vary by jurisdiction. Currently, refund claims and tax returns for certain years are being reviewed by state jurisdictions. No material adjustments are anticipated as a result of these examinations and reviews. The Company’s income tax returns for 2021 and subsequent tax years generally remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and foreign jurisdictions, and 2020 and subsequent years are subject to examination by state taxing authorities.

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, was $
51.8
 million, $
56.4
 million and $
24.2
 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate.
​
In connection with the Reorganization Transactions discussed below, the Company recorded unrecognized tax benefits and interest and penalties of $
121.4
 million and $
7.0
 million, respectively. Included in the balance of the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024, was $
141.2
 million attributable to tax refund claims with respect to tax years 2005 through 2013 and 2015 in the State of California. Such refund claims were filed by the Company in 2015, 2019 and 2021, on behalf of the Company and its affiliates, including BOW, concerning the determination of taxes for which 
no
 benefit is currently recognized. It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease within the next 12 months by as much as $
0.6
 million of taxes and $
0.2
 million of accrued interest and penalties as a result of settlements and the expiration of the statute of limitations in various states. On February 1, 2023, Bank of Montreal acquired Bank of the West from BNP Paribas SA. This transaction, and the resulting change in ownership, could affect the unrecognized tax benefits related to the years when the Company was included in consolidated and combined returns with Bank of the West.

​
The Company recognizes interest and penalties attributable to both unrecognized tax benefits and undisputed tax adjustments in the provision for income taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $
4.0
 million, $
4.2
 million and $
0.8
 million, respectively, of net expense attributable to interest and penalties. The Company had a liability of $
29.1
 million and $
28.5
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, accrued for interest and penalties, of which $
27.4
 million and $
26.6
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were attributable to unrecognized tax benefits and the remainder was attributable to tax adjustments which are not expected to be in dispute.
​

Table of Contents
Prior to the Reorganization Transactions, the Company filed consolidated U.S. Federal and combined state tax returns that incorporated the tax receivables and unrecognized tax benefits of FHB and BOW. The consummation of the Reorganization Transactions did not relieve the Company of the pre-Reorganization Transactions tax receivables and unrecognized tax benefits recognized by BOW that were included in the Company's consolidated and combined tax returns. As a result, on April 1, 2016, the Company recorded $
72.8
 million related to current tax receivables, $
116.6
 million related to unrecognized tax benefits, and an indemnification payable of $
28.6
 million. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company maintained balances of $
130.5
 million related to current tax receivables. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company maintained balances of $
159.0
 million and $
160.6
 million, respectively, related to unrecognized tax benefits, and an indemnification receivable of $
28.5
 million and $
30.1
 million, respectively. Additionally, in connection with the Reorganization Transactions, the Company has incurred certain tax-related liabilities related to the distribution of its interest in BWHI amounting to $
95.4
 million. The amount necessary to pay the distribution taxes (net of the expected federal tax benefit of $
33.4
 million) was paid by BNPP to the Company on April 1, 2016. The Company reported total distribution taxes of $
92.1
 million in the 2016 tax returns of various state and local jurisdictions, and reimbursed BWHI approximately $
2.1
 million pursuant to a tax sharing agreement entered into on April 1, 2016 and pursuant to certain tax allocation agreements entered into among the parties. The Company expects that any future adjustment to such taxes will be similarly reimbursed to, or funded by, BWHI, BNPP or their affiliates. Accordingly, the assumption of the pre-Reorganization Transactions tax receivables, unrecognized tax benefits and distribution tax liabilities and the offsetting indemnification receivables or payables were reflected as equity contributions and distributions on April 1, 2016. The reimbursement of distribution taxes to BWHI was also reflected as an adjustment to equity. If there are any future adjustments to the indemnified tax receivables or unrecognized tax benefits, an offsetting adjustment to the indemnification receivables or payables will be recorded to the provision for income taxes and other noninterest income or expense. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $
2.1
 million, $
2.5
 million and 
nil
, respectively, of such adjustments through the provision for income taxes and noninterest income. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded $
3.8
 million of such adjustments through the provision for income taxes and noninterest expense.
​
​
16. Derivative Financial Instruments 
​
The Company enters into derivative contracts primarily to manage its interest rate risk, as well as for customer accommodation purposes. Derivatives used for risk management purposes consist of interest rate swaps and collars that are designated as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. The derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities at fair value. Derivatives entered into for customer accommodation purposes consist of various free-standing interest rate derivative products and foreign exchange contracts. The Company is party to master netting arrangements with its financial institution counterparties; however, the Company does not offset assets and liabilities under these arrangements for financial statement presentation purposes.

 million in cash as collateral for interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the cash collateral includes the excess initial margin for interest rate swaps cleared through clearinghouses and cash collateral for interest rate swaps with financial institution counterparties.
​
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company received $
43.7
 million and $
40.9
 million, respectively, in securities collateral for interest rate swaps, which is held in a custodial account and is not recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
​
Fair Value Hedges
​
To manage the risk related to the Company’s net interest margin, interest rate swaps are utilized to hedge certain fixed-rate loans. These swaps have maturity, amortization and prepayment features that correspond to the loans hedged and are designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Any gain or loss on the swaps, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, is recognized in current period earnings.
​
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company carried 
one
 interest rate swap with a notional amount of $
63.8
 million and $
67.5
 million, respectively, which was designated and qualified as a fair value hedge for a commercial and industrial loan. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the interest rate swap had a positive fair value of $
8.8
 million and $
10.9
 million, respectively. The swap matures in 2041. The Company received a USD Federal Funds floating rate and paid a fixed rate of 
2.07
%.

Cash Flow Hedges
​
The Company utilized interest rate swaps to reduce asset sensitivity and enhance current yields associated with interest payments received on a pool of floating-rate loans. The Company entered into interest rate swaps paying floating rates and receiving fixed rates. The floating-rate index (Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index, or “BSBY”) corresponds to the floating-rate nature of the interest receipts being hedged (based on USD Prime). The swaps provided an initial benefit to interest income as the Company received the higher fixed rate, which persisted while the floating rate remained below the swap’s fixed rate. By hedging with interest rate swaps, the Company minimized the adverse impact on interest income previously associated with a low interest rate environment on floating-rate loans.
​
As of December 31, 2023, the Company carried 
two
 interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $
200.0
 million, with a negative fair value totaling $
1.8
 million. The swaps matured in April 2024. The Company received fixed rates ranging from 
1.70
% to 
2.08
% and paid 1-month BSBY.
​
The Company also utilized interest rate collars to manage interest rate risk and protect against downside risk in yields associated with interest payments received on a pool of floating-rate assets. The floating-rate index of the collars (Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or “SOFR”) corresponds to the floating-rate nature of the interest receipts being hedged (based on SOFR). Interest rate collars involve the payments of variable-rate amounts if the collar index exceeds the cap strike rate on the contract and receipts of variable-rate amounts if the collar index falls below the floor strike rate on the contract. No payments are required if the collar index falls between the cap and floor rates. By hedging with interest rate collars, the Company mitigates the adverse impact on interest income associated with possible future decreases in interest rates.
​
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company carried 
two
 interest rate collars with notional amounts totaling $
200.0
 million. As of December 31, 2024, these interest rate collars had a negative fair value of $
0.1
 million. As of December 31, 2023, these interest rate collars had a positive fair value of $
0.7
 million. The collars mature in 2025 and 2027. The interest rate collars had a floor strike rate of 
2.00
% and cap strike rates ranging from 
5.31
% to 
5.64
%.
​
The interest rate swaps and collars are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges. To the extent that the hedge is considered highly effective, the gain or loss on the interest rate swaps and collars is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company carried multiple interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $
2.5
 billion, all of which were related to the Company’s customer swap program, with a positive fair value of $
4.8
 million and a negative fair value of $
6.0
 million. The Company received floating rates ranging from 
4.87
% to 
7.55
% and paid fixed rates ranging from 
2.39
% to 
6.67
%. The swaps mature between 2025 and 2043. As of December 31, 2023, the Company carried multiple interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling $
2.8
 billion, all of which were related to the Company’s customer swap program, with a positive fair value of $
1.2
 million and a negative fair value of $
0.5
 million. The Company received floating rates ranging from 
5.84
% to 
8.34
% and paid fixed rates ranging from 
2.39
% to 
5.98
%. These swaps resulted in net interest expense of 
nil
 during each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.
​
The Company’s customer swap program is designed by offering customers a variable-rate loan that is swapped to fixed-rate through an interest-rate swap. The Company simultaneously executes an offsetting interest-rate swap with a swap dealer. Upfront fees on the dealer swap are recorded in other noninterest income and totaled $
1.4
 million, $
1.8
 million and $
2.5
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
​
Visa Class B Restricted Shares
​
In 2016, the Company recorded a $
22.7
 million net realized gain related to the sale of 
274,000
 Visa Class B restricted shares. Concurrent with the sale of the Visa Class B restricted shares, the Company entered into a funding swap agreement with the buyer that requires payment to the buyer in the event Visa reduces each member bank’s Class B conversion rate to unrestricted Class A common shares. During 2018 through 2023, Visa funded its litigation escrow account, thereby reducing each member bank’s Class B conversion rate to unrestricted Class A common shares from 
1.6483
 to 
1.5875
. Under the terms of the funding swap agreement, the Company will make monthly payments to the buyer based on Visa’s Class A stock price and the number of Visa Class B restricted shares that were sold until the date on which the covered litigation is settled. In April 2024, Visa, Inc. commenced an initial exchange offer (“Visa Exchange Offer”) for all of its outstanding Class B shares (subsequently renamed as “Class B-1 shares”), of which the buyer elected and Visa, Inc. accepted. The buyer received a combination of Visa Class B-2 shares and Visa Class C shares in exchange for the 
274,000
 Class B-1 shares previously owned by the Company. Visa Class B-2 shares and Visa Class C shares have a current conversion rate to Class A common shares of 
1.5430
 and 
4.0000
, respectively. The Company took this exchange into consideration when valuing the derivative liability (“Visa derivative”) at December 31, 2024. The Visa derivative of $
2.3
 million was included in the consolidated balance sheets at both December 31, 2024 and 2023, to provide for the fair value of this liability. There were no sales of these shares prior to 2016. See “Note 21. Fair Value” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.
​
Counterparty Credit Risk
​
By using derivatives, the Company is exposed to counterparty credit risk if counterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as expected. If a counterparty fails to perform, the Company’s counterparty credit risk is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset, net of cash or other collateral received, and net of derivatives in a loss position with the same counterparty to the extent master netting arrangements exist. The Company minimizes counterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, executing master netting arrangements and obtaining collateral, where appropriate. Counterparty credit risk related to derivatives is considered in determining fair value.
​
151

Table of Contents
The Company’s interest rate swap agreements include bilateral collateral agreements with collateral requirements which begin with exposures in excess of $
0.3
 million. For each counterparty, the Company reviews the interest rate swap collateral daily. Collateral for customer interest rate swap agreements, calculated as the pledged asset less loan balance, requires valuation of the pledged asset. Counterparty credit risk adjustments of 
nil
, 
nil
 and $
0.1
 million were recognized during each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Risk

Related Contingent

Features
​
Certain of the Company’s derivative contracts contain provisions whereby if its credit rating were to be downgraded by certain major credit rating agencies as a result of a merger or material adverse change in the Company’s financial condition, the counterparty could require an early termination of derivative instruments. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with such credit-risk related contingent features that are in a net liability position was 
nil
 at both December 31, 2024 and 2023, for which the Company posted 
nil
 in collateral in the normal course of business. If the Company’s credit rating had been downgraded on December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company may have been required to settle the contract in an amount equal to its fair value.
​
17. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
​
Contingencies
​
Various legal proceedings are pending or threatened against the Company. After consultation with legal counsel, management does not expect that the aggregate liability, if any, resulting from these proceedings would have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
​
Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
​
The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby and commercial letters of credit which are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. 
​
Unfunded Commitments to Extend Credit
​
A commitment to extend credit is a legally binding agreement to lend funds to a customer, usually at a stated interest rate and for a specified purpose. Commitments are reported net of participations sold to other institutions. Such commitments have fixed expiration dates and generally require a fee. The extension of a commitment gives rise to credit risk. The actual liquidity requirements or credit risk that the Company will experience is expected to be lower than the contractual amount of commitments to extend credit because a significant portion of those commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon. Certain commitments are subject to loan agreements containing covenants regarding the financial performance of the customer that must be met before the Company is required to fund the commitment. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments to extend credit as it does in making loans. In addition, the Company manages the potential credit risk in commitments to extend credit by limiting the total amount of arrangements, both by individual customer and in the aggregate, by monitoring the size and expiration structure of these portfolios and by applying the same credit standards maintained for all of its related credit activities. Commitments to extend credit are reported net of participations sold to other institutions of $
87.6
 million and $
61.8
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
​

Table of Contents
Standby and Commercial Letters of Credit
​
Standby letters of credit are issued on behalf of customers in connection with contracts between the customers and third parties. Under standby letters of credit, the Company assures that the third parties will receive specified funds if customers fail to meet their contractual obligations. The credit risk to the Company arises from its obligation to make payment in the event of a customer’s contractual default. Standby letters of credit are reported net of participations sold to other institutions of $
6.6
 million and $
6.8
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company also had commitments for commercial and similar letters of credit. Commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate commerce whereby the commitment is typically drawn upon when the underlying transaction between the customer and a third party is consummated. The maximum amount of potential future payments guaranteed by the Company is limited to the contractual amount of these letters. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Collateral held supports those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary. The commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2024 have maturities ranging from January 2025 to June 2028. Substantially all fees received from the issuance of such commitments are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the commitment.

Guarantees
​
The Company sells residential mortgage loans in the secondary market primarily to The Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA” or “Fannie Mae”) and The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC” or “Freddie Mac”) that may potentially require repurchase under certain conditions. This risk is managed through the Company’s underwriting practices. The Company services loans sold to investors and loans originated by other originators under agreements that may include repurchase remedies if certain servicing requirements are not met. This risk is managed through the Company’s quality assurance and monitoring procedures. Management does not anticipate any material losses as a result of these transactions.
​
Lease Commitments
​
The Company’s lease commitments are discussed in “Note 13. Leases” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
​
Foreign Exchange Contracts
​
The Company has forward foreign exchange contracts that represent commitments to purchase or sell foreign currencies at a future date at a specified price. The Company’s utilization of forward foreign exchange contracts is subject to the primary underlying risk of movements in foreign currency exchange rates and to additional counterparty risk should its counterparties fail to meet the terms of their contracts. Forward foreign exchange contracts are utilized to mitigate the Company’s risk to satisfy customer demand for foreign currencies and are not used for trading purposes. See “Note 16. Derivative Financial Instruments” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information.

Reorganization Transactions
​
In connection with the Reorganization Transactions as discussed in “Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, FHI (formerly BancWest) distributed its interest in BWHI (including BOW) to BNPP so that BWHI was held directly by BNPP (BWHI is now held indirectly by BNPP through its intermediate holding company). As a result of the Reorganization Transactions that occurred on April 1, 2016, various tax or other contingent liabilities could arise related to the business of BOW, or related to the Company’s operations prior to the Reorganization Transactions when it was known as BancWest, including its then wholly owned subsidiary, BOW. The Company is not able to determine the ultimate outcome or estimate the amounts of these contingent liabilities, if any, at this time. The Company recorded an increase to other noninterest expense of $
3.8
 million and an equal offsetting decrease of $
3.8
 million to the provision for income taxes during the year ended December 31, 2024, related to adjustments made to certain of these uncertain tax liabilities.
​
18. Revenue from Contracts with Customers
​
In accordance with Topic 606, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
,

revenues are recognized when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, the Company assesses the goods or services that are promised within each contract and identifies those that contain performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.

Most of the Company’s revenue is not within the scope of Topic 606. The guidance explicitly excludes net interest income from financial assets and liabilities as well as other noninterest income from loans, leases, investment securities and derivative financial instruments.
​
For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, substantially all of the Company’s revenues under the scope of Topic 606 were related to performance obligations satisfied at a point in time.
​
The following is a discussion of revenues within the scope of Topic 606.
​
Service Charges on Deposit Accounts 
​
Service charges on deposit accounts relate to fees generated from a variety of deposit products and services rendered to customers. Charges include, but are not limited to, overdraft fees, non-sufficient fund fees, dormant fees and monthly service charges. Such fees are recognized concurrent with the event on a daily basis or on a monthly basis depending upon the customer’s cycle date.
​
Credit and Debit Card Fees 
​
Credit and debit card fees primarily represent revenues earned from interchange fees, ATM fees and merchant processing fees. Interchange and network revenues are earned on credit and debit card transactions conducted with payment networks. ATM fees are primarily earned as a result of surcharges assessed to non-FHB customers who use an FHB ATM. Merchant processing fees are primarily earned on transactions in which FHB is the acquiring bank. Such fees are generally recognized concurrently with the delivery of services on a daily basis.
​

Table of Contents
Trust and Investment Services Fees
​
Trust and investment services fees represent revenue earned by directing, holding and managing customers’ assets. Fees are generally computed based on a percentage of the previous period’s value of assets under management. The transaction price (i.e., percentage of assets under management) is established at the inception of each contract. Trust and investment services fees also include fees collected when the Company acts as agent or personal representative and executes security transactions, performs collection and disbursement of income, and completes investment management and other administrative tasks.
​
Other Fees 
​
Other fees primarily include revenues generated from wire transfers, lockboxes, bank issuance of checks and insurance commissions. Such fees are recognized concurrent with the event or on a monthly basis.
​
Contract Balances
​
A contract liability is an entity’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration (or the amount is due) from the customer. The Company received signing bonuses from 
two
 vendors in prior years and 
two
 vendors in the current year, which are being amortized over the term of the respective contracts. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had contract liabilities of $
2.2
 million and $
1.9
 million, respectively, which will be recognized over the remaining term of the respective contracts with the vendors. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized revenues, thereby decreasing contract liabilities by approximately $
0.9
 million, $
0.8
 million and $
0.9
 million, respectively, due to the passage of time. There were 
no
 changes in contract liabilities due to changes in transaction price estimates.
​
A contract asset is the right to consideration for transferred goods or services when the amount is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were 
no
 material receivables from contracts with customers or contract assets recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
​
Other
​
Except for the contract liabilities noted above, the Company did 
no
t have any significant performance obligations as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company also did 
no
t have any material contract acquisition costs or use any significant judgments or estimates in recognizing revenue for financial reporting purposes.
​
19. Earnings per Share
​
For the years ended 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company made 
no
 adjustments to net income for the purpose of computing earnings per share and there were 
nil
, 
574,000
 and 
nil
 antidilutive securities, respectively.

20. Stock-Based Compensation
​
The Company has several stock-based compensation plans that allow for grants of restricted stock, restricted shares, performance share units, performance shares and restricted stock units to its employees and non-employee directors. The Company’s stock-based compensation plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, stock-based compensation expense was $
11.9
  million, $
9.6
 million and $
10.3
 million, respectively, and the related income tax benefit was $
2.5
 million, $
2.3
 million and $
2.5
 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, all common stock issuances in connection with stock-based compensation arrangements were issued from unissued shares.
​
As of December 31, 2024, total shares authorized under the Company’s stock-based compensation plan for employees were 
5.6
 million shares, of which 
1.8
 million shares were available for future grants. As of December 31, 2024, total shares authorized under the 2016 Non-Employee Director Plan were 
268,941
 shares, of which 
101,720
 shares were available for future grants.
​
Restricted Share Awards
​
Restricted share awards (“RSAs”) provide grantees with rights to shares of common stock contingent upon completion of a service period. RSAs generally vest, and any restrictions will lapse, over a period of 
three years
 in equal annual installments on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date, provided that the grantee remain continuously employed through the applicable vesting date, subject to certain exceptions. Grantees have the right to receive all dividends without restrictions at the times and in the manner paid to shareholders generally. The fair value of RSAs is determined based on the closing price of FHI’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company recognizes compensation expense related to RSAs on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for service-based awards.

Performance Share Units and Performance Share Awards
​
Performance share units (“PSUs”) and performance share awards (“PSAs”) (collectively, “Performance Awards”) are an award of units or shares in which the recipient’s rights in the units or shares are contingent on the achievement of pre-established performance goals. At the end of the performance period, the Compensation Committee will determine to what extent the performance goals originally outlined when the Performance Awards were granted have been achieved. Depending on the level of performance achieved, 
0
-
200
% of the original grant (target number) of PSUs will be earned and will vest and 
0
-
200
% of the original grant (target number) of PSAs will be earned and will vest. All remaining unvested PSUs or PSAs will be immediately forfeited. Employees must be continuously employed by the Company from the grant date through the applicable vesting date, with any unvested Performance Awards being forfeited upon termination of employment, subject to certain exceptions. Following vesting, the Company will issue 
one
 share of FHI common stock for each vested PSU and evidence of ownership of 
one
 share of FHI common stock for each vested PSA. The fair value of Performance Awards is estimated based on the use of a Monte Carlo simulation or based on the closing price of FHI’s common stock on the date of grant and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. For PSUs, grantees have no voting rights until the shares of common stock underlying vested PSUs are delivered to the grantee. Conversely, for PSAs, grantees have full voting rights as of the grant date.
​
The Performance Awards are governed by the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”), which is designed to reward selected key employees for their individual performance and the Company’s performance measured over multi-year performance cycles. Awards related to the LTIP provide for equity-based awards based on the Company’s profitability and market conditions that are based on the Company’s performance relative to peer groups over a 
three-year
 performance period.

Restricted Stock Units
​
Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) are an award of units that correspond in number and value to a specified number of shares of FHI’s common stock that are subject to vesting requirements, including certain service conditions, and transferability restrictions. RSUs do not represent actual ownership of common stock and grantees have no voting rights until the shares of common stock underlying the RSUs are delivered. Following vesting, the Company will issue 
one
 share of FHI common stock for each vested RSU. The fair value of RSUs is valued based on the closing price of FHI’s common stock on the date of grant and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
​
The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) which permits employees to periodically purchase Company stock on a payroll deduction basis. Participant purchases through the ESPP receive a discount of 
5
% from the closing price of FHI’s common stock on the exercise date. Participants are required to adhere to a 
two-year
 holding period with regards to shares purchased through the ESPP. The ESPP has been determined to be non-compensatory in nature. As a result, the Company expects that expenses related to the ESPP will not be material. As of December 31, 2024, total shares authorized under the Company’s ESPP were 
600,000
 shares, of which 
487,291
 shares of common stock were available for future purchases. The Company issued 
11,362
 shares, 
16,226
 shares and 
16,680
 shares of common stock to employee participants in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
​
21. Fair Value
​
The Company determines the fair values of its financial instruments based on the requirements established in ASC 820, 
Fair Value Measurements
, which provides a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP and requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 defines fair value as the exit price, the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date under current market conditions.
​
Fair Value Hierarchy
​
ASC 820 establishes three levels of fair values based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. The levels are:  
​
●
Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. 
●
Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 
●
Level 3: Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company’s own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability (“Company-level data”). Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using unobservable inputs to pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 
​
ASC 820 requires that the Company disclose estimated fair values for certain financial instruments. Financial instruments include such items as investment securities, loans, deposits, interest rate and foreign exchange contracts, swaps and other instruments as defined by the standard. The Company has an organized and established process for determining and reviewing the fair value of financial instruments reported in the Company’s financial statements. The fair value measurements are reviewed to ensure they are reasonable and in line with market experience in similar asset and liability classes.
​
Additionally, the Company may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as collateral-dependent loans, other real estate owned, other customer relationships, and other intangible assets. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual assets.
​
Disclosure of fair values is not required for certain items such as lease financing, obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits, premises and equipment, prepaid expenses, deposit liabilities with no defined or contractual maturity, and income tax assets and liabilities. 
​
Reasonable comparisons of fair value information with that of other financial institutions cannot necessarily be made because the standard permits many alternative calculation techniques, and numerous assumptions have been used to estimate the Company’s fair values.

Table of Contents
Valuation Techniques Used in the Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities Carried at Fair Value
​
For the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (categorized in the valuation hierarchy table below), the Company applies the following valuation techniques:
​
Available-for-sale securities
​
Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based on quoted prices, including estimates by third-party pricing services, if available. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using proprietary valuation models that utilize market observable parameters from active market makers and inter-dealer brokers whereby securities are valued based upon available market data for securities with similar characteristics. Management reviews the pricing information received from the Company’s third-party pricing service to evaluate the inputs and valuation methodologies used to place securities into the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy and transfers of securities within the fair value hierarchy are made if necessary. On a monthly basis, management reviews the pricing information received from the third-party pricing service which includes a comparison to non-binding third-party broker quotes, as well as a review of market-related conditions impacting the information provided by the third-party pricing service. Management also identifies investment securities which may have traded in illiquid or inactive markets by identifying instances of a significant decrease in the volume or frequency of trades, relative to historical levels, as well as instances of a significant widening of the bid-ask spread in the brokered markets. The Company’s third-party pricing service has also established processes for the Company to submit inquiries regarding quoted prices. Periodically, the Company will challenge the quoted prices provided by the third-party pricing service. The Company’s third-party pricing service will review the inputs to the evaluation in light of the new market data presented by the Company. The Company’s third-party pricing service may then affirm the original quoted price or may update the evaluation on a going forward basis. The Company classifies all available-for-sale securities as Level 2.
​
Derivatives
​
Most of the Company’s derivatives are traded in over-the-counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available. For those derivatives, the Company measures fair value on a recurring basis using proprietary valuation models that primarily use market observable inputs, such as yield curves, and option volatilities. The fair value of derivatives includes values associated with counterparty credit risk and the Company’s own credit standing. The Company classifies these derivatives, included in other assets and other liabilities, as Level 2.
​
Concurrent with the sale of the Visa Class B restricted shares, the Company entered into an agreement with the buyer that requires payment to the buyer in the event Visa reduces each member bank’s Class B conversion rate to unrestricted Class A common shares. During 2018 through 2023, Visa funded its litigation escrow account, thereby reducing each member bank’s Class B conversion rate to unrestricted Class A common shares from 
1.6483
 to 
1.5875
. As a result of the Visa Exchange Offer, the buyer held a combination of Visa Class B-2 shares and Visa Class C shares, of which the Visa derivative’s notional is based on. Visa Class B-2 shares and Visa Class C shares have a current conversion rate to Class A common shares of 
1.5430
 and 
4.0000
, respectively. The Visa derivative of $
2.3
 million was included in the consolidated balance sheets at both December 31, 2024 and 2023, to provide for the fair value of this liability. The potential liability related to this funding swap agreement was determined based on management’s estimate of the timing and the amount of Visa’s litigation settlement and the resulting payments due to the counterparty under the terms of the contract. As such, the funding swap agreement is classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s funding swap agreement are the potential future changes in the Class B-2 conversion rate, expected term and growth rate of the market price of Visa Class A common shares. Material increases (or decreases) in any of those inputs may result in a significantly higher (or lower) fair value measurement.

​
Unfunded loan and lease commitments and letters of credit are not included in the tables above. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had $
6.0
 billion and $
6.5
 billion, respectively, of unfunded loan and lease commitments and letters of credit. A reasonable estimate of the fair value of these instruments is the carrying value of deferred fees plus the related reserve for unfunded commitments, which totaled $
47.4
 million and $
49.8
 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. No active trading market exists for these instruments and the estimated fair value does not include value associated with the borrower relationship. The Company does not estimate the fair values of certain unfunded loan and lease commitments that can be canceled by providing notice to the borrower. As Company-level data is incorporated into the fair value measurement, unfunded loan and lease commitments and letters of credit are classified as Level 3.

Table of Contents
Valuation Techniques Used in the Fair Value Measurement of Assets and Liabilities Carried at the Lower of Cost or Fair Value
​
The Company applies the following valuation techniques to assets measured at the lower of cost or fair value:
​
Mortgage servicing rights
​
MSRs are carried at the lower of cost or fair value and are therefore subject to fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis. The fair value of MSRs is determined using models which use significant unobservable inputs, such as estimates of prepayment rates, the resultant weighted average lives of the MSRs and the option-adjusted spread levels. Accordingly, the Company classifies MSRs as Level 3.
​
Collateral-dependent loans
​
Collateral-dependent loans are those for which repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral.

These loans are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using collateral values as a practical expedient. The fair values of collateral are primarily based on real estate appraisal reports prepared by third-party appraisers less estimated selling costs. The Company may also use another available source of collateral assessment, such as purchase offers, letters of intent, or broker price opinions, to determine a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the collateral. The fair value of other collateral such as business assets is typically ascertained by assessing inventory listings and borrower’s financial statements less estimated selling costs. The Company measures the estimated credit losses on collateral-dependent loans by performing a lower of cost or fair value analysis. If the estimated credit losses are determined by the value of the collateral, the net carrying amount is adjusted to fair value on a nonrecurring basis as Level 3 by recognizing an ACL.
​
Other real estate owned
​
The Company values these properties at fair value at the time the Company acquires them, which establishes their new cost basis. After acquisition, the Company carries such properties at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is measured on a nonrecurring basis using collateral values as a practical expedient. The fair values of collateral for other real estate owned are primarily based on real estate appraisal reports prepared by third-party appraisers less disposition costs and are classified as Level 3.
​
Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
​
The Company may be required to record certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP. These assets are subject to fair value adjustments that result from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual assets to fair value.
​
The following table provides the level of valuation inputs used to determine each fair value adjustment and the fair value of the related individual assets or portfolio of assets with fair value adjustments on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2024:

Table of Contents

22. Reportable Operating Segments
​
The Company’s operations are organized into 
three
 business segments – Retail Banking, Commercial Banking and Treasury and Other. These segments reflect how discrete financial information is currently evaluated by the chief operating decision maker and how performance is assessed and resources allocated. The Company’s internal management process measures the performance of these business segments. This process, which is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution, uses various techniques to assign balance sheet and income statement amounts to the business segments, including allocations of income, expense, the provision for credit losses and capital. This process is dynamic and requires certain allocations based on judgment and other subjective factors. Unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive authoritative guidance for management accounting that is equivalent to GAAP. 
​
The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the chief executive officer, who assesses the segments’ performance by using each segment’s net income. Segment net income is predominantly considered in the annual budget and forecasting process. The chief operating decision maker considers budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis to monitor profitability of each segment as well as to monitor each segment’s expenditures alongside the performance of each segment and its respective managers.
​
The net interest income of the business segments reflects the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics and reflects the allocation of net interest income related to the Company’s overall asset and liability management activities on a proportionate basis. The basis for the allocation of net interest income is a function of the Company’s assumptions that are subject to change based on changes in current interest rates and market conditions. Funds transfer pricing also serves to transfer interest rate risk to Treasury. 
​
The Company allocates the provision for credit losses from the Treasury and Other business segment (which is comprised of many of the Company’s support units) to the Retail and Commercial business segments. These allocations are based on direct costs incurred by the Retail and Commercial business segments. 
​
Noninterest income and expense includes allocations from support units to the business segments. These allocations are based on actual usage where practicably calculated or by management’s estimate of such usage. Income tax expense is allocated to each business segment based on the consolidated effective income tax rate for the period shown.
​
Business Segments
​
Retail Banking
​
Retail Banking offers a broad range of financial products and services to consumers and small businesses. Loan and lease products offered include residential and commercial mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit and loans, automobile loans and leases, secured and unsecured lines of credit, installment loans and small business loans and leases. Deposit products offered include checking, savings and time deposit accounts. Retail Banking also offers wealth management services. Products and services from Retail Banking are delivered to customers through 
48
 banking locations throughout the State of Hawaii, Guam and Saipan. 
​
Commercial Banking
​
Commercial Banking offers products that include corporate banking related products, commercial real estate loans, commercial lease financing, secured and unsecured lines of credit, automobile loans and auto dealer financing, business deposit products and credit cards. Commercial lending and deposit products are offered primarily to middle-market and large companies locally, nationally and internationally. 
​

Table of Contents
Treasury and Other 
​
Treasury consists of corporate asset and liability management activities including interest rate risk management. The segment’s assets and liabilities (and related interest income and expense) consist of interest-bearing deposits, investment securities, federal funds sold and purchased, government deposits, short- and long-term borrowings and bank-owned properties. The primary sources of noninterest income are from bank-owned life insurance, net gains from the sale of investment securities, foreign exchange income related to customer driven cross-border wires for business and personal reasons and management of bank-owned properties. The net residual effect of the transfer pricing of assets and liabilities is included in Treasury, along with the elimination of intercompany transactions.
​
Other organizational units (Technology, Operations, Credit and Risk Management, Human Resources, Finance, Administration, Marketing and Corporate and Regulatory Administration) provide a wide range of support to the Company’s other income earning segments. Expenses incurred by these support units are charged to the business segments through an internal cost allocation process.

ITEM 9.    CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
​
Not applicable.
​
ITEM 9A.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
​
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
​
The Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of December 31, 2024. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.
​
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
​
Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Internal control is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation of reliable published financial statements. Internal control over financial reporting includes self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.
​
Because of inherent limitations in any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected, including the possibility of the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time.
​
Management assessed the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “Internal Control – Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this assessment, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer assert that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the specified criteria.
​
Attestation Report of the Company’s Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
​
The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm who also has audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Deloitte & Touche LLP’s attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting appears on the following page and is incorporated by reference herein.
​
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
​
There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
​
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of 
First Hawaiian, Inc.
Honolulu, Hawaii
​
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

​
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of First Hawaiian, Inc. and subsidiary (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Because management’s assessment and our audit were conducted to meet the reporting requirements of Section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA), management’s assessment, and our audit of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting included controls over the preparation of the schedules equivalent to the basic consolidated financial statements in accordance with the instructions for the consolidated financial statements for bank holding companies (Form FR Y-9C). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
​
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
​
Basis for Opinion
​
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
​
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
​
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
​
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“generally accepted accounting principles”). A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
​
173

Table of Contents
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
