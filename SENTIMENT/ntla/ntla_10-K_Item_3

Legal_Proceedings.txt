Our forward-looking statements are based on a series of expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about our company, are not guarantees of future results or performance and involve substantial risks and uncertainty. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in these forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in these forward-looking statements. Our business and our forward-looking statements involve substantial known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties inherent in our statements regarding:

•
our ability to execute our clinical study strategy for nexiguran ziclumeran (“nex-z,” also referred to as NTLA-2001), our program for the treatment of transthyretin (“ATTR”) amyloidosis, including the ability to successfully complete our global Phase 3 study for ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (“ATTR-CM”), to complete our global Phase 3 study for hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (“ATTRv-PN”), file a biologics license application (“BLA”) or comparable marketing application within a certain time period, or the success of such program;

•
our ability to execute our clinical study strategy for NTLA-2002, our program for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (“HAE”), including the ability to successfully complete our global Phase 3 study, generate results supporting the potential of NTLA-2002 to be a functional cure for HAE, file a BLA or comparable marketing application within a certain time period, or the success of such program;

•
our ability to manufacture or obtain materials for our preclinical and clinical studies, and our product candidates;

•
our ability to advance any product candidates into, and successfully complete, clinical studies, including clinical studies necessary for regulatory approval and commercialization, and to demonstrate to applicable regulators that the product candidates are safe and effective and that their benefits outweigh known and potential risks for the intended patient population;

•
our ability to advance our genome editing and therapeutic delivery capabilities, including our therapeutic delivery capabilities for tissues other than the liver;

•
the scope of protection we are able to develop, establish and maintain for intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and license rights, covering our product candidates and technology;

•
our ability to operate, including commercializing products, without infringing or breaching the proprietary or contractual rights of others;

•
the issuance or enforcement of, and compliance with, regulatory requirements and guidance regarding preclinical and clinical studies relevant to genome editing and our product candidates;

•
estimates of our expenses, future revenues, capital requirements and our needs for additional financing;

•
the potential benefits of strategic agreements, such as collaborations, co-development and co-commercialization, acquisitions, dispositions, mergers, joint ventures, and investment agreements, and our ability to establish and maintain strategic arrangements under favorable terms;

•
our ability to acquire and maintain relevant intellectual property licenses and rights, and the scope and terms of such rights;

•
our ability to use a modular platform capability or other strategies to efficiently discover and develop product candidates, including by applying learnings from one program to other programs;

•
our ability to research, develop or maintain a pipeline of product candidates;

•
developments relating to our licensors, licensees, third parties and ventures from which we derive or license rights, as well as collaborators, competitors and our industry; and

All of our express or implied forward-looking statements are as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K only. In each case, actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking information. We can give no assurance that such expectations or forward-looking statements will prove to be correct. An occurrence of or any material adverse change in one or more of the risk factors or risks and uncertainties referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or included in our other public disclosures or our other periodic reports or other documents or filings filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Except as required by law, we do not undertake or plan to update or revise any such forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in plans, assumptions, estimates or projections or other circumstances affecting such forward-looking statements occurring after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, even if such results, changes or circumstances make it clear that any forward-looking information will not be realized. Any public statements or disclosures by us following this Annual Report on Form 10-K that modify or impact any of the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will be deemed to modify or supersede such statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Summary of the Material Risks Associated with Our Business

•
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology has only recently been clinically validated for human therapeutic use. 

•
The approaches we are taking to discover and develop novel therapeutics using CRISPR/Cas9 systems are unproven and may never lead to marketable products. 

•
If we are unable to develop viable product candidates, achieve regulatory approval for any such product candidate or market and sell any resulting product, we may never achieve profitability.

•
Clinical development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of any product candidates.

•
Results, including data from our preclinical and clinical studies, are not necessarily predictive of our other ongoing and future preclinical and clinical studies, and they do not guarantee or indicate the likelihood of approval of any potential product candidate by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or any other regulatory agency. If we cannot replicate the positive results from any of our preclinical or clinical activities and studies, we may be unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize any potential product candidate.

•
Negative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of CRISPR/Cas9 use, genome editing or gene therapy may damage public perception of the safety of our product candidates and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for such product candidates.

•
Even if we obtain regulatory approval of any product candidates, such candidates may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, hospitals, third party payors and others in the medical community.

•
We could be unsuccessful in obtaining or maintaining adequate patent protection for one or more of our products or product candidates or asserting and defending our intellectual property rights that protect our products and technologies.

•
We have licensed intellectual property from third parties for use in our programs, and termination or modification of any of these licenses could result in the loss of those intellectual property rights, which could harm our business.

•
We have never generated any revenue from product sales and our ability to generate revenue from product sales and become profitable depends significantly on our success in a number of areas.

•
We have incurred net losses in each period since our inception, anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses in the future and may never achieve profitability.

•
In vivo
 genome editing products and 
ex vivo
 engineered cell therapies based on CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology are novel, complex and difficult to manufacture. 

•
We could experience manufacturing problems that result in delays in the development, approval or commercialization of our product candidates or otherwise harm our business.

•
If we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, our ability to complete clinical trials or our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.

•
Our technological advancements and any potential for revenue may be derived in part from our collaborations, including, for example, with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Regeneron”), and if the collaboration or 

4

co-development agreements related to a material collaboration were to be terminated or materially altered in an adverse manner, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would be harmed.

•
Our internal computer systems, or those of our collaborators or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches or compromises, which could result in a material disruption of our operations and development efforts.

•
We face significant competition in an environment of rapid technological change. The possibility that our competitors may achieve regulatory approval before we do or develop therapies that are more advanced or effective than ours may harm our business and financial condition or our ability to successfully market or commercialize our product candidates. 

•
The price of our common stock historically has been volatile, which may affect the price at which you could sell any shares of our common stock.
