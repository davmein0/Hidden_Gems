Information pertaining to fiscal year 2022 was included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations,” which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on February 22, 2024.

Management Overview

Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “Intellia,” or the “Company”) is a leading clinical-stage gene editing company focused on revolutionizing medicine with CRISPR-based therapies. CRISPR is a gene editing technology which is also sometimes referred to as CRISPR/Cas or CRISPR/Cas9 when referring to the use of CRISPR technology with the Cas9 enzyme. Since its inception, Intellia has focused on leveraging gene editing technology to develop novel, first-in-class medicines that address important unmet medical needs and advance the treatment paradigm for patients. Intellia’s deep scientific, technical and clinical development experience, along with its people, are helping set the standard for a new class of medicine. To harness the full potential of gene editing, Intellia continues to expand the capabilities of its CRISPR-based platform with novel editing and delivery technologies. To fully realize the transformative potential of CRISPR/Cas9-based technologies, we are building a full-spectrum gene editing company, by leveraging our modular platform, to advance 
in vivo 
and 
ex vivo
 therapies for diseases with high unmet need by pursuing two primary approaches. For 
in vivo
 applications to address genetic diseases, we deploy CRISPR/Cas9 as the therapy. Our 
in vivo
 programs use CRISPR to enable precise editing of disease-causing genes directly inside the human body. In addition, we are advancing 
ex vivo 
applications to address immuno-oncology and autoimmune diseases, where we use CRISPR/Cas9 as the tool to create the engineered cell therapy. For our 
ex vivo
 programs, CRISPR/Cas9 is used to engineer human cells outside the body. Our deep scientific, technical and clinical development experience, along with our robust intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio, have enabled us to unlock broad therapeutic applications of CRISPR/Cas9 and related technologies to create new classes of genetic medicine.

Collaboration Revenue

Collaboration revenue increased by $21.6 million to $57.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $36.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in collaboration revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024 is primarily due to the recognition of $21.0 million of previously eliminated intra-entity profit under our license and collaboration agreement with AvenCell Therapeutics, Inc. (the “AvenCell LCA”) and a $12.8 million increase in revenue related to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Regeneron”), offset by a $12.3 million decrease in revenue related to the AvenCell LCA. Refer to Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses increased by $31.2 million to $466.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to $435.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023.

%

The increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to the year ended December 31, 2023 was primarily attributable to:

•
a $15.3 million increase in external costs related to the development of nexiguran ziclumeran (“nex-z”, also referred to as NTLA-2001), one of our lead product candidates, primarily due to an increase in spend on contracted services and consulting fees, offset in part by a decrease in drug components; 

•
a $17.6 million increase in external costs related to the development of NTLA-2002, primarily due to an increase in spend on drug components, contracted services and consulting fees; 

•
an $8.6 million decrease in external costs related to NTLA-3001, primarily related to initial manufacturing activities in 2023, offset in part by an increase in spend on contracted services;

•
a $9.2 million decrease in employee-related expenses, primarily driven by a workforce reduction in January 2024; 

•
a $6.3 million increase in facility-related expenses primarily related to depreciation, facility maintenance costs, technology expense allocated to research and development, and rent; and

•
a $12.0 million increase in stock-based compensation.

General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses increased by $9.3 million to $125.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $116.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily related to an increase in stock-based compensation of $8.2 million.

Other Income (Expense), Net

The decrease in other income (expense), net of $18.9 million is primarily related to $32.6 million in expense due to the change in fair value of our investments in Kyverna Therapeutics, Inc. (“Kyverna”) and AvenCell and a $2.0 million decrease in interest income, offset in part by a $15.6 million change related to our equity method loss recorded in the year ended December 31, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Since our inception through December 31, 2024, we have funded our operations through our initial public offering and concurrent private placements, follow-on public offerings, our collaboration agreements, at-the-market offerings and the sale of convertible preferred stock.

As of December 31, 2024, we had $861.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.

81

At-the-Market Offering Programs

2022 Sale Agreement

In 2022, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement (the “2022 Sale Agreement”) with Jefferies LLC (“Jefferies”), under which Jefferies is able to offer and sell, from time to time in “at-the-market” offerings, shares of our common stock having aggregate gross proceeds of up to $400.0 million. In February 2024, we entered into an amendment to the 2022 Sale Agreement (the “2022 Sale Agreement, as amended”) to increase the size of the at-the-market offering program from $400.0 million to $750.0 million. We agreed to pay cash commissions of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of sales of common stock under the 2022 Sale Agreement, as amended. To date through December 31, 2024 we have issued 14,522,533 shares of our common stock under the 2022 Sale Agreement, as amended. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we issued 7,004,370 shares of our common stock, in a series of sales, at an average price of $25.68 per share, in accordance with the 2022 Sale Agreement, as amended, for aggregate net proceeds of $174.8 million, after payment of cash commissions and approximately

$0.3 million related to legal, accounting and other fees in connection with the sales. As of December 31, 2024, $249.1 million in shares of common stock remain eligible for sale under the 2022 Sale Agreement, as amended.

Funding Requirements

Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, research and development research materials and contracted services, clinical trial costs, compensation and related expenses, laboratory and office facilities, research supplies, legal and regulatory expenses, patent prosecution filing and maintenance costs for our licensed IP, milestone and royalty payments and general overhead costs. During 2025, we expect our expenses to decrease

compared to prior periods as a result of our recently announced strategic reorganization in January 2025, as we focus resources on high value programs within our pipeline, such as NTLA-2002 and nex-z, to ensure efficient execution, achieve near-term clinical milestones, and prepare for commercial launch.

Because our lead programs are in the clinical stage and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain, we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of any future product candidates or whether, or when, we may achieve profitability. Until such time as we can generate substantial product revenues, if ever, we expect to fund our ongoing cash needs through equity financings and collaboration arrangements. We receive cost reimbursements from Regeneron related to our collaboration agreements with them. Additionally, we are eligible to earn milestone payments and royalties, in each case, on a per-product basis under our collaborations with SparingVision SAS (“SparingVision”), ONK Therapeutics, Ltd. (“ONK”) and ReCode Therapeutics, Inc. (“ReCode”), on a per-target basis under our collaboration with Regeneron, and upon achievement of certain events with Kyverna, subject to the provisions of our agreements with each of them. Except for these sources of funding, we will not have any committed external source of liquidity. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the future sale of equity, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration arrangements in the future, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.

Outlook

Based on our research and development plans and our expectations related to the progress of our programs, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2024, as well as research and cost reimbursement funding from our collaboration agreements, will enable us to fund our ongoing operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the first half of 2027, excluding any potential milestone payments or extension fees that could be earned and distributed under our collaboration agreements or any strategic use of capital not currently in the base case planning assumptions. We have based this estimate on current assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we expect.

Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends significantly on our success in many areas, including: developing our delivery technologies and our CRISPR/Cas9 technology platform; selecting appropriate product candidates to develop; completing research and preclinical and clinical development of selected product candidates; obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations for product candidates for which we complete clinical trials; developing a sustainable and scalable manufacturing process for product candidates; launching and commercializing product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations, either directly or with a collaborator or distributor; obtaining market acceptance of our product candidates; addressing any competing technological and market developments; negotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing, or other arrangements into which we may enter; maintaining good relationships with our

82

collaborators and licensors; maintaining, protecting, and expanding our portfolio of IP rights, including patents, trade secrets, and know-how; and attracting, hiring, and retaining qualified personnel.

Net cash used in operating activities

Net cash used in operating activities of $348.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily consists of a net loss of $519.0 million, further reduced by the non-cash recognition of $21.0 million of previously eliminated intra-entity profit recorded within “collaboration revenue” and accretion of investment discounts and premiums of $17.8 million. These decreases are offset in part by stock-based compensation of $154.3 million, $32.6 million in net adjustments to the fair value of our investments in Kyverna and AvenCell, net changes in operating assets and liabilities of $11.9 million and depreciation of $10.3 million.

Net cash used in operating activities of $394.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 primarily consists of a net loss of $481.2 million, further reduced by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $52.5 million, including the receipt of $18.7 million in payments from our collaboration partners during that period and offset in part by non-cash charges of stock-based compensation of $134.1 million, loss on equity method investment of $22.3 million and depreciation of $9.0 million.

Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we added $125.6 million of net cash through investing activities. The increase in the year ended December 31, 2024 is primarily due to $131.3 million in marketable securities that matured (net of purchases), offset in part by $5.8 million in cash used for the purchase of property and equipment.

During the year ended December 31, 2023 we used cash of $31.3 million in investing activities. The decrease in the year ended December 31, 2023 is primarily due to $17.4 million in marketable securities purchased (net of maturities) and $14.0 million in cash used for the purchase of property and equipment.

Net cash provided by financing activities

Net cash provided by financing activities of $185.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2024 includes $176.9 million in net proceeds from at-the-market offerings, $5.9 million in cash received from the exercise of stock options and $3.0 million in cash received from the issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.

Net cash provided by financing activities of $130.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 includes $119.8 million in net proceeds from at-the-market offerings, $6.6 million in cash received from the exercise of stock options and $3.9 million in cash received from the issuance of shares through our employee stock purchase plan.

Contractual Obligations

We have entered into arrangements that contractually obligate us to make payments that will affect our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.

Property Leases

As of December 31, 2024, our total undiscounted future minimum lease payments for our property leases that have commenced were $294.8 million, which will be paid over the term of such leases.

For additional information on our leases and timing of future payments refer to Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

83

Other Obligations

We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with various third parties for clinical trials, preclinical research studies, supply manufacturing and other services and products for operating purposes. These contracts are generally cancelable at any time by us upon prior written notice.

We do not include any potential future pass-through milestone payments or royalty payments we may be required to make under our existing license agreements or the merger agreement related to our acquisition of Rewrite Therapeutics, Inc. (“Rewrite”) due to the uncertainty of the occurrence of the events requiring payment under those agreements. These payments are not reflected in the disclosures above. In January 2023, a research milestone related to Rewrite was achieved and settled.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates

Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheets and the reported amounts of collaboration revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from our estimates, judgments and assumptions. We periodically review our estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.

We define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. that require the most significant judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. We believe the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements which require significant estimates and judgments are as follows:

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 and its related amendments (collectively known as Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 606 (“ASC 606”).

At inception, we determine whether contracts are within the scope of ASC 606 or other topics. For contracts that are determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods and services. To achieve this core principle, we apply the following five steps: (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when we determine that collection of substantially all consideration for goods and services that are transferred is probable based on the customer’s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration.

84

As of December 31, 2024, our revenue recognized is solely related to collaboration agreements with third parties which are either within the scope of ASC 606, under which we license certain rights to our product candidates to third parties, or within the scope of ASC 808, 
Collaborative Arrangements
 (“ASC 808”) if it involves a joint operating activity pursuant to which we are an active participant and are exposed to significant risks and rewards with respect to the arrangement. As discussed in further detail in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we enter into out-licensing agreements which are within the scope of ASC 606, under which we license certain rights to our product candidates to third parties and may provide services related to the research and development of the product candidates. The terms of these arrangements typically include consideration payable to us of one or more of the following: nonrefundable, upfront fees; development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments; research and development funding payments; and royalties on the net sales of licensed products. Additionally, the terms of certain arrangements may include an equity interest in the other company. Consideration received from each of these payments results in collaboration revenues, except for revenues from royalties on the net sales of licensed products, which are classified as royalty revenues. For arrangements within the scope of ASC 808, the terms of these arrangements typically include payments received or made under the cost sharing provisions which are recognized as a component of collaboration revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

In determining the accounting for each contract, the significant areas of management judgment or estimation include the determination of accounting for contract changes as modifications and whether those are separate and distinct or part of a partially satisfied performance obligation, determining the transaction price, identifying the distinct performance obligations within a contract, determining the standalone selling prices for distinct performance obligations when more than one distinct performance obligation is identified within a contract and determining the revenue recognition pattern for each performance obligation that best reflects the timing of when we transfer control of goods and services to the customer. If the consideration received in exchange for entering into a contract is in the form of noncash consideration, we are required to estimate the fair value of the noncash consideration received. If our estimates of the noncash consideration received are not appropriate it could impact the total amount of revenue recognized for the contract. Furthermore, many of our performance obligations, whether distinct or combined, do not have readily available standalone selling prices and therefore we are required to make judgments and estimates regarding the standalone selling prices when relevant. To the extent the estimates are not appropriate in the circumstances, it could impact the timing of our revenue recognition. We evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and if estimates related to the measure of progress change, related revenue recognition is adjusted accordingly.

Accrued Research and Development Expenses

As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to vendors in connection with clinical research organizations (“CROs”) in connection with clinical studies, vendors in connection with preclinical development activities and vendors related to development, manufacturing and distribution of clinical trial materials.

We base our expenses related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense.

Stock-Based Compensation

Our share-based compensation programs grant awards that have included stock options and restricted stock units. Grants are awarded to employees and non-employees, including directors. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period.

We measure employee stock-based compensation for stock options based on the grant date fair value of the equity awards using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For awards with service conditions only, we recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For equity awards that have a performance or market condition, we recognize stock-based compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method. Estimates of stock-based compensation expense for an award with a performance condition are based on our assessment of the probability that the performance condition will be achieved, which requires significant judgment. Our stock price is a key input that will drive the grant date fair value of the equity awards. Forfeitures are recorded as they occur.

85

The fair value of market-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units with a Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) multiplier are determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements.

We classify stock-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss in the same manner in which the award recipient’s salary and related costs are classified or in which the award recipient’s service payments are classified.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15, “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our business.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The market risk inherent in our financial instruments and in our financial position represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, we had cash equivalents, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities of $739.4 million consisting of interest-bearing money market accounts, corporate and financial institution debt securities, U.S. Treasury and other government securities and asset-backed securities. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly because our investments are primarily in marketable securities. Due to the short-term duration of our investment portfolios and the low risk profile of our investments, we do not believe an immediate change of 100 basis points, or one percentage point, would have a material effect on the fair market value of our investment portfolio. Declines in interest rates, however, would reduce future interest income.

We do not have any foreign currency or derivative financial instruments. Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor, preclinical and clinical trial costs. We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations during the year ended December 31, 2024.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data

The information required by this item is presented at the end of this report beginning on page F-1.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

None.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company has established disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer (our Chief Executive Officer) and principal financial officer (our Chief Financial Officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the

86

company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:

•
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;

•
Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and

•
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework 
(2013 framework) (“COSO”). Based on its assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.

Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which is included below.

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting

No change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intellia Therapeutics, Inc.

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. and subsidiary (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk

87

that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Intellia Therapeutics, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. and subsidiary (the "Company") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Equity-Method Investment — Accounting for the Loss of Significant Influence – Refer to Note 10 to the financial statements
.

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company historically accounted for its investment in AvenCell Therapeutics, Inc. (“AvenCell”) (the “AvenCell investment”) under the equity method of accounting in accordance with ASC 323, 
Investments – Equity Method and Joint Ventures 
(“ASC 323”). During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company determined that they lost the ability to exercise significant influence over AvenCell. This resulted in management having to determine the accounting for the AvenCell investment as part of the transition from ASC 323 to ASC 321
, Investments — Equity Securities 
(“ASC 321”)
.

We identified the accounting for the transition of the AvenCell investment from ASC 323 to ASC 321 as a critical audit matter. Auditing the Company’s application of the guidance required significant auditor judgment, including the need to involve an internal subject matter expert, due to the complex nature of evaluating the treatment of previously eliminated intra-entity profit and previously recognized accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with the AvenCell investment, under the guidance in ASC 323.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our principal audit procedures related to the Company’s accounting for the AvenCell investment upon the transition from ASC 323 to ASC 321 included the following:

•
We tested the effectiveness of controls over the Company’s processes for assessing the accounting treatment of the AvenCell investment upon the transition from ASC 323 to ASC 321.

•
With the assistance of professionals in our firm having expertise in equity-method accounting, we evaluated the Company’s application of relevant accounting guidance regarding the treatment of previously eliminated intra-entity profit and accumulated other comprehensive loss associated with the AvenCell investment upon the transition from ASC 323 to ASC 321.

•
We obtained and read the Company’s accounting position paper assessing the accounting treatment of the AvenCell investment upon the transition from ASC 323 to ASC 321.

•
We tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculations of the accounting associated with the AvenCell investment upon the transition from ASC 323 to ASC 321.

INTELLIA THERAPEUTICS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Nature of Operations
Organization
Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (“Intellia” or the “Company”) is a leading clinical-stage gene editing company focused on revolutionizing medicine with CRISPR-based therapies. CRISPR is a gene editing technology which is also sometimes referred to as CRISPR/Cas or CRISPR/Cas9 when referring to the use of CRISPR technology with the Cas9 enzyme. Since its inception, Intellia has focused on leveraging gene editing technology to develop novel, first-in-class medicines that address important unmet medical needs and advance the treatment paradigm for patients. Intellia’s deep scientific, technical and clinical development experience, along with its people, is helping set the standard for a new class of medicine. To harness the full potential of gene editing, Intellia continues to expand the capabilities of its CRISPR-based platform with novel editing and delivery technologies. To fully realize the transformative potential of CRISPR-based technologies, the Company is building a full-spectrum gene editing company, by leveraging its modular platform, to advance 
in vivo
 and 
ex vivo
 therapies for diseases with high unmet need by pursuing two primary approaches. For 
in vivo
 applications to address genetic diseases, the Company deploys CRISPR as the therapy. The Company’s 
in vivo
 programs use CRISPR to enable precise editing of disease-causing genes directly inside the human body. In addition, the Company is advancing 
ex vivo
 applications to address immuno-oncology and autoimmune diseases, where it uses CRISPR as the tool to create the engineered cell therapy. For its 
ex vivo
 programs, CRISPR is used to engineer human cells outside the body. The Company’s deep scientific, technical and clinical development experience, along with its robust intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio, have enabled it to unlock broad therapeutic applications of CRISPR and related technologies to create new classes of genetic medicine.
The Company was founded and commenced operations in 2014. The Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to clinical-stage companies in the biotechnology industry, including, but not limited to, development by competitors of more advanced or effective therapies, dependence on key executives, protection of and dependence on proprietary technology, compliance with government regulations and ability to secure additional capital to fund operations. Programs currently in development or moving into development will require significant additional research and development efforts, including preclinical and clinical testing and regulatory approval prior to commercialization. These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel and infrastructure and extensive compliance-reporting capabilities. Even if the Company’s product development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will realize significant revenue from product sales.

Liquidity
Since its inception through December 31, 2024, the Company has funded its operations through its initial public offering (“IPO”) and concurrent private placements, follow-on public offerings, at-the-market offerings and the sale of convertible preferred stock, as well as through its collaboration agreements. The Company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities

as of December 31, 2024
 will enable the Company to fund its ongoing operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the twelve-month period following the issuance of these consolidated financial statements.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. and its wholly owned, controlled subsidiary, Intellia Securities Corp. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss, unrealized gain (loss) on marketable securities and other comprehensive gain (loss) from equity method investment
.
Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates in these consolidated financial statements have been made in connection with the calculation of revenues, research and development expenses, valuation and determination of impairment of equity and fair value method investments, contingent consideration and stock-based compensation expense. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time such estimates are made. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company periodically reviews its estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience.

F-
7

The effects of material revisions in estimates are reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of the change in estimate.
Fair Value Measurements
The Company’s financial instruments include cash equivalents, restricted cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, non-marketable securities, accounts payable and accrued expenses. Certain of the Company’s financial assets, including cash equivalents, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities, have been initially valued at the transaction price, and subsequently revalued at the end of each reporting period, utilizing third party pricing services or other observable market data. The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models and observable market inputs to determine value. Investments in non-marketable securities are accounted for using the measurement alternative at cost minus impairment, adjusted for changes in observable prices.
Refer to Note 4 for further information regarding the Company’s fair value measurements.
Other financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, are carried at cost, which approximate fair value due to the short duration and term to maturity.
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2024
 and 2023, cash equivalents consisted of interest-bearing money market accounts, U.S. Treasury bills and other government securities.
Restricted Cash Equivalents
The Company has restricted cash equivalents made up of money market funds held in collateral accounts that are restricted to secure letters of credit in accordance with certain of its leases. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, these restricted cash equivalents amounted to 
$
13.6
 million
. The letters of credit are required to be maintained throughout the term of the leases; in some cases, the Company is able to reduce the amounts held over time. These restricted cash equivalents are long-term in nature and are included in “Investments and other assets” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
Marketable Securities
The Company’s marketable securities are accounted for as available-for-sale and recorded at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, a component of stockholders’ equity.

The Company reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have an indication of possible other-than-temporary impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and the Company’s intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.
Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding the Company’s marketable securities.
Investments in Equity Securities
Investments in equity securities, other than equity method investments, are recorded at fair market value if fair value is readily determinable and any gains and losses are included in “Change in fair value of investments, net,” on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. In the absence of a readily determinable fair value, the Company measures the investment at cost less impairment, plus or minus observable changes, if any. These investments are included in “Investments and other assets” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 10 for further information regarding the Company’s investments in equity securities.
Asset Acquisitions
At the time of acquisition, the Company determines if a transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or acquisition of assets. The Company measures and recognizes asset acquisitions that are not deemed to be business combinations based on the cost to acquire the assets, which includes transaction costs, and the consideration is allocated to the items acquired based on a relative fair value methodology. Goodwill is not recognized in asset acquisitions. In an asset acquisition, the cost allocated to acquire in-process research and development with no alternative future use is charged to research and development expense at the acquisition date.

F-

Concentrations of Credit Risk

The Company’s cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities may potentially be subject to concentrations of credit risk. The Company generally maintains balances in various accounts in excess of federally insured limits with financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality.

Accounts receivable represents amounts due from collaboration partners and joint ventures. The Company monitors economic conditions to identify facts or circumstances that may indicate that any of its accounts receivable are at risk of collection. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s accounts receivable were related to its collaborations with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Regeneron”), SparingVision SAS (“SparingVision”), AvenCell Therapeutics, Inc. (“AvenCell”) and ReCode Therapeutics, Inc. (“ReCode”). As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s accounts receivable were related to its collaborations with Regeneron, SparingVision, AvenCell and Kyverna Therapeutics, Inc. (“Kyverna”)
.

Property and Equipment
The Company records property and equipment at cost and recognizes depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the respective assets:

Asset Category

Useful Life

Laboratory equipment

5 years

Office furniture and equipment

5 years

Computer software

3 years

Computer equipment

3 years

Leasehold improvements

Shorter of useful life or remaining lease term

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance of assets are expensed as incurred. Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed and the corresponding accumulated depreciation are removed from the related accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the results of operations
.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company tests long-lived assets to be held and used, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets or asset groups may not be fully recoverable. Factors that the Company considers in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets.

Evaluation of recoverability of the asset or asset group is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. In the event that such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, the assets are written down to their estimated fair values. The impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying value of the impaired asset over its fair value, determined based on discounted cash flows. To date, the Company has not recorded any material impairment losses on long-lived assets.

Leases
The Company accounts for its leases in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) 842, 
Leases (Topic 842)
 (“ASC 842”). At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the facts and circumstances present in the arrangement. Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and short-term and long-term lease liabilities, as applicable. The Company has elected not to recognize leases with an original term of one year or less on the balance sheet. The Company does not have any financing leases.
Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are initially recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as incentives received and prepaid lease payments. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments, which reflects the fixed rate at which the Company could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

F-
9

The Company is required to pay fees for operating expenses in addition to monthly base rent for certain operating leases. The Company has elected the practical expedient which allows non-lease components to be combined with lease components for all asset classes. Variable lease payments are not included within the lease right-of-use asset and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheet, and instead are reflected as expense in the period they are incurred.
The Company typically only includes an initial lease term in its assessment of a lease arrangement. Options to renew or terminate a lease are not included in the Company’s assessment unless there is reasonable certainty of execution. The lease commencement date is the date on which a lessor makes the underlying asset available for use by the Company. Lease payments (including payments pertaining to lessor-owned leasehold improvements) made to the lessor prior to lease commencement are recorded as prepaid rent and included in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The prepaid rent balance is reclassified to the right-of-use asset at lease commencement.
The Company’s real estate operating leases provide for scheduled annual rent increases throughout the lease terms. The Company recognizes the effects of the scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the full terms of the lease. Tenant improvement allowances, if any, provided by a landlord are recorded as a reduction of the right-of-use asset related to that lease at lease commencement.
Contingent Consideration
The Company accounts for contingent consideration identified in an asset acquisition, that is payable in cash and does not meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815, 
Derivatives and Hedging
, when the contingency is resolved and the consideration is paid or becomes payable.

The Company accounts for contingent consideration identified in an asset acquisition that is settled in shares of common stock under ASC 480, 
Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity 
(“ASC 480”). The contingent consideration liability will be recorded at fair value at the end of each reporting period with changes in estimated fair values recorded in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes.

The Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets, including recent earnings results, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods available and other relevant factors. The Company records changes in the required valuation allowance in the period that the determination is made.

The Company assesses its income tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available as of the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company records the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 
50
% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company does not recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company records interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions, if applicable, as a component of income tax expense.

Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)
 and its related amendments (collectively known as “ASC 606”).

At inception, the Company determines whether contracts are within the scope of ASC 606 or other topics. For contracts that are determined to be within the scope of ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for these goods and services. To achieve this core principle, the Company applies the following five steps: (i) identify the contract with the customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv)

F-
10

allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when the Company determines that collection of substantially all consideration for goods and services that are transferred is probable based on the customer’s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration.
Performance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods and services, the Company applies judgment to determine whether promised goods and services are both capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. If these criteria are not met, the promised goods and services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.
The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price utilizing either the expected value method or the most likely amount method, depending on the nature of the variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in the Company’s judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue under the contract will not occur. Any estimates, including the effect of the constraint on variable consideration, are evaluated at each reporting period for any changes. Determining the transaction price requires significant judgment, which is discussed in further detail for each of the Company’s collaboration agreements in Note 9. In addition, none of the Company’s contracts as of December 31, 2024 or 2023 contained a significant financing component.
If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis unless the transaction price is variable and meets the criteria to be allocated entirely to a performance obligation or to a distinct service that forms part of a single performance obligation. The consideration to be received is allocated among the separate performance obligations based on relative standalone selling prices. The Company typically determines standalone selling prices using an adjusted market assessment approach model.

The Company satisfies performance obligations either over time or at a point in time. Revenue is recognized over time if either (i) the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the entity’s performance, (ii) the entity’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created or enhanced, or (iii) the entity’s performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the entity and the entity has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. If the entity does not satisfy a performance obligation over time, the related performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time by transferring the control of a promised good or service to a customer. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the measure of performance and related revenue recognition.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s revenue recognized is solely related to collaboration agreements with third parties which are either within the scope of ASC 606, under which the Company licenses certain rights to its product candidates to third parties, or within the scope of ASC 808, 
Collaborative Arrangements
 (“ASC 808”) if it involves a joint operating activity pursuant to which the Company is an active participant and is exposed to significant risks and rewards with respect to the arrangement. For the collaboration arrangements under the scope of ASC 606, as discussed in further detail in Note 9, the terms of these arrangements typically include payment to the Company of one or more of the following: nonrefundable, upfront fees; development, regulatory, and commercial milestone payments; research and development funding payments; and royalties on the net sales of licensed products. Additionally, the terms of certain arrangements may include an equity interest in the other company. Each of these payments results in collaboration revenues, except for revenues from royalties on the net sales of licensed products, which are classified as royalty revenues. For arrangements within the scope of ASC 808, the terms of these arrangements typically include payments received or made under the cost sharing provisions which are recognized as a component of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.
Licenses of intellectual property:
 If the license to the Company’s IP is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, the Company recognizes revenues from consideration allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the customer and the customer is able to use and benefit from the licenses. For licenses that are combined with other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and, if over time, the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue.

Milestone payments: 
At the inception of each arrangement that includes development milestone payments, the Company evaluates the probability of reaching the milestones and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the

F-
11

most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur in the future, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the control of the Company or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals, are not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received and therefore revenue recognized is constrained as management is unable to assert that a reversal of revenue would not be probable. The transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis, for which the Company recognizes revenue as or when the performance obligations under the contract are satisfied. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of such development milestones and any related constraint and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect collaboration revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment.

Royalties:
 For arrangements that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on levels of sales, if the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, the Company recognizes revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). To date, the Company has not recognized any royalty revenue resulting from any of its collaboration agreements.
The Company receives payments from its customers based on billing schedules or upon the achievement of milestones established in each contract. The Company’s contract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. Upfront payments and fees are recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt or when due and may require deferral of revenue recognition to a future period until the Company satisfies its obligations under these arrangements.
The Company also considers the nature and contractual terms of an arrangement and assesses whether the arrangement involves a joint operating activity pursuant to which both the Company and the co-party to the arrangement is an active participant and is exposed to significant risks and rewards with respect to the arrangement. If the Company is an active participant and is exposed to the significant risks and rewards with respect to the arrangement, the Company accounts for the arrangement under ASC 808
. 
Based on this consideration, accounting for the Company’s co-development agreements with Regeneron and AvenCell is under ASC 808. Because ASC 808 does not provide recognition and measurement guidance for collaborative arrangements, the Company has analogized to ASC 606. Refer to Note 9 for additional information regarding the Company’s collaboration agreements.

Research and Development Expenses
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities, such as salaries, stock-based compensation and benefits of employees, allocated facility-related expenses, overhead expenses, license, sublicense and milestone fees, contract research, clinical trial costs, development and manufacturing services, and other related costs.

The Company records payments made for research and development services prior to the services being rendered as prepaid expenses on the consolidated balance sheet and expenses them as the services are provided. Contracts for multi-year research and development services are recorded on a straight-line basis over each annual contractual period based on the total contractual fee when the services rendered are expected to be substantially equivalent over the term of the arrangement. The cost of obtaining licenses for certain technology or IP is recorded to research and development expense when incurred if the licensed technology or IP has not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company’s share-based compensation programs grant awards that have included stock options and restricted stock units. Grants are awarded to employees and non-employees, including directors. Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period.

The fair value of stock option grants is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Use of the valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a term consistent with the expected life of the stock options. Volatility assumptions are calculated based on historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company estimates the expected term of options using the simplified method. In addition, an expected dividend yield of zero is used in the option valuation model because the Company does not pay cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Forfeitures are recorded as they occur. The fair value of market-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units with a Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) multiplier are determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which uses multiple input variables to determine the probability of satisfying the market condition requirements.

F-
12

For awards with service conditions only, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards with performance or market-based conditions, the Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method over the requisite service period. Estimates of stock-based compensation expense for an award with performance conditions are based on the probable outcome of the performance conditions and the cumulative effect of any changes in the probability outcomes are recorded in the period in which the changes occur.
The Company classifies stock-based compensation expense in its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss in the same manner in which the award recipient’s salary and related costs are classified or in which the award recipient’s service payments are classified.

Net Loss per Share

The Company calculates basic net loss per share by dividing net loss for each respective period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for each respective period. The Company computes diluted net loss per share after giving consideration to the dilutive effect of stock options and unvested restricted stock units that are outstanding during the period, except where such securities would be anti-dilutive.

Segment Information

The Company has identified 
one
 operating and reportable segment: the development of gene editing-based therapies. All of the Company’s material assets are held in the United States (“U.S.”) and all of the Company’s collaboration revenue has been generated in the U.S. 
The operating segment’s revenue is primarily generated through collaboration arrangements with third parties. The Company does not have any intra-entity sales or transfers.
The Company manages all business activities on a consolidated basis. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is the chief executive officer (“CEO”).

The accounting policies for the segment are the same as described those described in Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” The CODM evaluates the performance of the operating segment and allocates resources based on net loss that also is reported on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The CODM uses net loss to monitor budget versus actual results and to analyze cash flows in assessing performance of the segment and allocating resources. The measure of the operating segment assets is reported on the consolidated balance sheets as total assets.

10.3
 million, $
9.0
 million, and $
7.6
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as disclosed within Note 5, “Property and Equipment, Net.”
Variable Interest Entity
The Company evaluates at the inception of each arrangement, and whenever a reconsideration event occurs, whether an entity in which the Company holds an investment or in which the Company has other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (“VIE”) in accordance with FASB ASC 
Topic 810, Consolidation
 (“ASC 810”). If the entity meets the criteria to qualify as a VIE, the Company assesses whether or not the Company is the primary beneficiary of that VIE based on a number of factors, including (i) which party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance, (ii) the parties’ contractual rights and responsibilities pursuant to any contractual agreements and (iii) which party has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE. If the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company consolidates such entity and reflects the non-controlling interest of other beneficiaries of that entity. If the Company is not the primary beneficiary, no consolidation is necessary, and the Company accounts for the investment or other variable interest in accordance with applicable U.S. GAAP.

Equity Method of Accounting
In circumstances where the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of an entity in which the Company has a common stock or in-substance common stock investment, the Company utilizes the equity method of accounting for recording related investment activity. In assessing whether the Company exercises significant influence, the Company considers the nature and magnitude of the investment, the voting and protective rights the Company holds, any participation in the governance of the other entity and other relevant factors such as the presence of a collaborative or other business relationship.

Under the equity method of accounting, the Company’s investments are initially recorded at cost on the consolidated balance sheets. Upon recording an equity method investment, the Company evaluates whether there are basis differences between the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s proportionate share of the investee’s underlying net assets. Typically, the Company amortizes basis differences identified on a straight-line basis over the underlying assets’ estimated useful lives when calculating the attributable earnings or losses, excluding the basis differences attributable to in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) that has no alternative future use. If the Company is unable to attribute all of the basis difference to specific assets or liabilities of the investee, the residual excess of the cost of the investment over the proportional fair value of the investee’s assets and liabilities is considered to be equity method goodwill and is recognized within the equity investment balance, which is tracked separately within the Company’s memo accounts. The Company subsequently records in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss its share of income or loss of the other entity within other income/expense. If the share of losses exceeds the carrying value of the Company’s investment, the Company will suspend recognizing additional losses and will continue to do so unless it commits to providing additional funding; however, if there are intra-entity profits this can cause the investment balance to go negative.
The Company evaluates its equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired and considers qualitative and quantitative factors including the investee's financial metrics, product and commercial outlook and cash usage. If a decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period and the investment is written down to fair value.

At December 31, 2024, the Company did not account for any of its investments under the equity method of accounting. At December 31, 2023, the Company accounted for its investment in AvenCell

under the equity method of accounting. Refer to Note 10 for further details regarding the transition out of the equity method of accounting.

The amortized cost of available-for-sale securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. There were 
no
 material realized gains or losses in the years ended 
December 31, 2024 or 2023. The Company did not reclassify any amounts out of accumulated other comprehensive loss during these periods. The Company generally does not intend to sell any investments prior to recovery of their amortized cost basis for any investment in an unrealized loss position. As such, the Company has classified these losses as temporary in nature.

The Company’s available-for-sale securities that are classified as short-term marketable securities in the consolidated balance sheets mature within one year or less as of the balance sheet date. Available-for-sale securities that are classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets are those that mature after 
one year
 but within 
five years
 from the balance sheet date and that the Company does not intend to dispose of within the next twelve months. At 
December 31, 2024
 and 2023, the Company did 
no
t hold any marketable securities that matured beyond five years of the balance sheet date.
Accrued interest on marketable securities is included in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets”
 on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.

4. Fair Value Measurements
The Company classifies fair value-based measurements using a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows: Level 1, quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2, observable inputs other than quoted market prices included in Level 1, such as quoted market prices for markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data; and Level 3, unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.
The Company’s financial assets recognized at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following:

Certain of the Company’s financial assets, including cash equivalents, restricted cash equivalents and marketable securities, have been initially valued at the transaction price, and subsequently revalued at the end of each reporting period, utilizing third party pricing services or other observable market data. The pricing services utilize industry standard valuation models and observable market inputs to determine value.
Other financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expense, are carried at cost, which approximates fair value due to the short duration and term to maturity.
The Company has determined that the estimated fair value of its investment in Kyverna, a publicly traded company, is reported as Level 1 as it is valued at a quoted market price in an active market. The investment in Kyverna is classified within “Investments and other assets” in the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 10 for further details.
Other Investments
The Company’s investment in SparingVision was initially recorded at fair value, determined according to Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy described above. The SparingVision investment is included in “Investments and other assets” on the consolidated balance sheets. This investment is accounted for using the measurement alternative at cost minus impairment, adjusted for changes in observable prices. There were no changes in observable prices or impairment of this investment as of December 31, 2024 or 2023. The carrying value of the SparingVision investment was $
14.6
 million and $
14.8
 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Refer to Note 10 for further details.

The Company’s investment in AvenCell was initially recorded at fair value, determined according to Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy described above. The AvenCell investment is included in “Investments and other assets” on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. This investment is accounted for using the measurement alternative at cost minus impairment, adjusted for changes in observable prices. The Company previously accounted for the AvenCell investment under the equity method; refer to Note 10 for further details including the change in fair value.

In the fourth quarter of 2024, AvenCell completed a Series B financing, which represented an observable price change in the investment in AvenCell. The Company determined the fair value of the AvenCell investment using an option pricing model which requires the input of certain subjective assumptions. The key assumptions used in the option pricing model, which are Level 3 inputs, include
 the anticipated holding period to an exit and liquidity event, the indicated equity volatility (
95
%), and the risk free rate (
3.9
%)
. The carrying value of the Company’s investment in AvenCell was $
7.9
 million and $
11.8
 million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively
.

Contingent Consideration
As part of its acquisition of Rewrite Therapeutics, Inc. (“Rewrite”) in 2022, the Company made a $
25.0
 million research milestone payment in February of 2023, payable in a combination of $
0.9
 million in cash and the remainder in the Company’s common stock. The milestone payable in the Company’s common stock resulted in liability classification under ASC 480. This contingent consideration liability was carried at fair value which was estimated by applying a probability-based model, which utilized inputs based on timing of achievements that were unobservable in the market. The contingent consideration liability was classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy until it was settled in February of 2023.
The following table reconciles the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability (in thousands):

7. Income Taxes
The Company did not record net income tax benefits for the operating losses incurred during the periods presented due to the uncertainty of realizing a tax benefit from those losses. Accordingly, any benefit recorded related to these deferred tax assets was offset by a valuation allowance reflecting management’s conclusion that realization of those assets was not more likely than not.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”
) requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize, rather than deduct, research and development expenditures under section 174 for tax years beginning after December 31, 2021. These rules became effective for the Company during the year ended December 31, 2022. As a result, the Company has capitalized research and development costs of $
405.3
 million and $
365.8
 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
The Company will amortize these costs for tax purposes over 5 years if the research and development was performed in the U.S. and over 15 years if the research and development was performed outside the U.S.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of 
$
1,088.4
 million
 and $
954.0
 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities.

Approximately $
36.9
 million of the federal net operating losses generated prior to 2018 will 
begin to expire in 
2034
, unless previously utilized. Losses incurred prior to 2018 will generally be deductible to the extent of the lesser of a corporation’s net operating loss carryover or 
100
% of a corporation’s taxable income and be available for 
twenty years
 from 
the period the loss

F-
18

was 
generated. The federal net operating losses generated after 2017 of approximately $
1,051.5
 million will be carried over indefinitely, but will generally limit the net operating loss deduction to the lesser of the net operating loss carryforward or 
80
% of a corporation’s taxable income (subject to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended). Also, there will be no carryback for losses incurred after 2017.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company also had state net operating loss carryforwards of 
$
1,079.2
 million
 and $
922.8
 million, respectively, which may be available to offset future income tax liabilities and 
begin to expire in 
2034
.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately 
$
139.3
 million
 and $
100.7
 million, respectively, which 
begin to expire in 
2034
. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had state research and development and other credit carryforwards of 
$
77.9
 million
 and $
64.1
 million, which 
begin to expire in 
2029
.
The Company evaluated the expected realizability of its net deferred tax assets and determined that there was significant negative evidence due to its net operating loss position and insufficient positive evidence to support the realizability of these net deferred tax assets. The Company concluded it is more likely than not that its net deferred tax assets would not be realized in the future; therefore, the Company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset balance as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The valuation allowance increased by $
167.1
 million in 2024, $
161.3
 million in 2023, and $
150.0
 million in 2022.

Ownership changes may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards or research and

development tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future taxable income or tax liability. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain shareholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50% over a three-year period. If the Company has experienced a change of control, utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 and 383 of the Code. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards or research and development tax credit carryforwards before utilization. During 2022, the Company completed an assessment of the available net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes under Section 382 that covered the period from inception through December 31, 2022. The analysis did not result in a material limitation to the Company’s tax attributes and the results of this analysis are reflected herein. The Company has not completed an analysis through December 31, 2024. To the extent there was a change in control during 2023 and 2024, the Company's tax attributes could be subject to limitation. However, a full valuation allowance has been provided against the deferred tax assets related to the Company’s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and, if an adjustment is required, this adjustment would be offset by an adjustment to the valuation allowance.
As of December 31, 2024
, the Company had 
no
t identified any unrecognized tax benefits. The Company will recognize interest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense if they arise.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal tax jurisdiction and Massachusetts and various other state tax jurisdictions. The Company is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service, Massachusetts taxing authorities and state taxing authorities for tax year 2021 through present. To the extent that the Company has tax attribute carryforwards, the tax year in which the attributes were generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service or State taxing authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. The returns in these jurisdictions since inception remain open for examination.

8. Commitments and Contingencies
Litigation
From time to time, the Company may be involved in legal and administrative proceedings and claims of various types. In some actions, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, would require significant expenditures. The Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company reviews these estimates each accounting period as additional information is known and adjusts the loss provision when appropriate. If a matter is both probable to result in a liability to the Company and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company estimates and discloses the possible loss or range of loss. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in its consolidated financial statements.
BlueAllele Corp. v. Intellia Therapeutics, Inc.
On July 8, 2024, BlueAllele Corp. (“BlueAllele”) filed a complaint alleging infringement by the Company of various patents in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. Specifically, BlueAllele alleges that the Company’s experimentation, basic

F-
19

research, identification, optimization, manufacturing and/or use of bi-directional insertion template technology infringes the asserted patents and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and an injunction against the alleged infringing activities. On September 12, 2024, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, and on December 9, 2024, the court denied the Company’s motion to dismiss and discovery began. On January 6, 2025, the Company filed its answer and counterclaims, and BlueAllele filed a motion to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims on January 27, 2025. On February 21, 2025, the court substantially denied BlueAllele’s motion to dismiss, and granted the motion with respect to one counterclaim. At this stage, the Company is unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or estimate the amount or range of potential loss, if any.
Gonzalez v. Intellia Therapeutics, Inc.
On February 11, 2025, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a lawsuit, captioned 
Gonzalez v. Intellia Therapeutics, Inc.
, No. 1:25-cv-01353 (D. Mass.), in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Company and certain of our officers on behalf of a putative class of stockholders who purchased Company shares from July 30, 2024 through January 8, 2025. The complaint alleges claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) premised upon statements relating to the Company’s NTLA-3001 program and the demand for viral-based editing. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, interest, reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs. The Company intends to defend vigorously against the claims. At this stage, the Company is unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or estimate the amount or range of potential loss, if any.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, except as noted above, there have been no material changes to any outstanding litigation, nor is the Company a party to any material new litigation.
License and Other Agreements
The Company is party to license and other agreements, which may include contingent payments. These payments 
could include up to $
130.0
 million related to Rewrite, including $
100.0
 million upon achievement of a regulatory approval milestone and $
30.0
 million upon achievement of pre-specified research milestones. 
As of December 31, 2024
, the satisfaction and timing of the contingent payments is uncertain and not reasonably estimable.

9. Collaborations and Other Arrangements

The Company has not incurred significant expenses to obtain collaboration agreements and costs to fulfill those contracts do not generate or enhance resources of the Company. As such, 
no
 costs to obtain or fulfill a contract have been capitalized in any period.
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
In April 2016, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Regeneron (as amended from time to time, the “2016 Regeneron Agreement”). The 2016 Regeneron Agreement has two principal components: i) a product development component under which the parties will research, develop and commercialize CRISPR/Cas-based therapeutic products primarily focused on genome editing in the liver, and ii) a technology collaboration component, pursuant to which the Company and Regeneron will engage in research-related activities aimed at discovering and developing novel technologies and improvements to CRISPR/Cas technology to enhance the Company’s genome editing platform. Under this agreement, the Company also may access the Regeneron Genetics Center and proprietary mouse models to be provided by Regeneron for a limited number of the Company’s liver programs. At the inception of the 2016 Regeneron Agreement, Regeneron selected the first of its 10 targets, transthyretin (“ATTR”) amyloidosis, which is subject to a co-development and co-promotion agreement between the Company and Regeneron (the “ATTR Co/Co”).
In connection with the 2016 Regeneron Agreement, the Company received a nonrefundable upfront payment of $
75.0
 million. In addition, on Regeneron programs that are not subject to Co/Co agreements, the Company may be eligible to earn, on a per-licensed target basis, (i) up to $
25.0
 million in development milestones, including for the dosing of the first patient in each of Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials, (ii) up to $
110.0
 million in regulatory milestones, including for the acceptance of a regulatory filing in the U.S., and for obtaining regulatory approval in the U.S. and in certain other identified countries, and (iii) up to $
185.0
 million in sales-based milestone payments. The Company is also eligible to earn royalties ranging from the high-single digits to low teens, in each case, on a per-product basis, which royalties are potentially subject to various reductions and offsets and incorporate the Company’s existing low- to mid-single-digit royalty obligations under a license agreement with Caribou. In connection with the 2016 Regeneron Agreement, Regeneron purchased $
50.0
 million of the Company’s common stock in a private placement under a stock purchase agreement concurrent with the Company’s IPO.
In May 2020, the Company entered into (i) amendment no. 1 (the “2020 Regeneron Amendment”) to the 2016 Regeneron Agreement, (ii) co-development and co-funding agreements for the treatment of hemophilia A and hemophilia B (the “Hemophilia Co/Co”) agreements and (iii) a stock purchase agreement. The collaboration expansion builds upon the jointly developed targeted transgene insertion capabilities designed to durably restore missing therapeutic protein, and to overcome the limitations of traditional gene therapy. The technology collabora
tion was extended until April 2024, at which point Regeneron would have an option to renew for an additional two years. The 2020 Regeneron Amendment also granted Regeneron exclusive rights to develop products for 
five
 additional 
in vivo
 CRISPR/Cas-based therapeutic liver targets and non-exclusive rights to independently develop and commercialize up to 
10

ex vivo
 gene edited products made using certain defined cell types.
As part of the consideration for the 2020 Regeneron Amendment, Regeneron paid the Company an upfront payment of $
70.0
 million, which included the $
25.0
 million fee to extend the Technology Collaboration Term, as defined in the 2016 Regeneron Agreement, to 
April 2024
. The potential future milestones and royalties remain unchanged from the 2016 Regeneron Agreement. In addition, on 
May 30, 2020
, the Company and Regeneron entered into the 2020 Stock Purchase Agreement. 
Under the 2020 Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company sold to Regeneron 
925,218
 shares of its common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share, for aggregate cash consideration of $
30.0
 million, or $
32.42
 per share (the “Equity Transaction”), representing a 
100
% premium over the volume-weighted average trading price of the Company’s common stock during the 30-day period prior to the closing of the Equity Transaction. Under the 2020 Stock Purchase Agreement, Regeneron will not dispose of any shares of common stock it beneficially owns in the Company until the termination of the Technology Collaboration Term.

In October 2023, Regeneron notified the Company that it was exercising its one-time option to extend the Technology Collaboration Term for an additional 
two years

(the “2024 Technology Collaboration Extension”)
, until 
April 2026
, in exchange for a nonrefundable payment of $
30.0
 million that was paid in April 2024.

2024 Technology Collaboration Extension: Accounting Analysis. 
The 
2024 Technology Collaboration Extension was accounted for as a contract modification. The promised goods and services under the 2024 Technology Collaboration Extension are not

F-
21

distinct 
from the combined performance obligations identified in the 2020 Regeneron Amendment, which was only partially satisfied at the date of option exercise. A cumulative catch-up adjustment was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2023 resulting in a charge of $
10.3
 million against revenue previously recognized.

The transaction price of the 2024 Technology Collaboration Extension was determined to be $
51.7
 million, which is comprised of the $
11.4
 million remaining consideration under the 2020 Regeneron Amendment as of the modification date, the $
30.0
 million extension fee and the $
10.3
 million cumulative catch-up adjustment. The $
51.7
 million transaction price was allocated to the performance obligations including the licenses to targets and associated research activities and evaluation plans and the combined performance obligation including the technology collaboration and associated research activities, on a relative standalone selling price basis.

As a result of this evaluation, the Company allocated $
48.3
 million to the combined performance obligation including the licenses to targets and associated research activities and evaluation plans and $
3.4
 million to the combined performance obligation including the technology collaboration and associated research activities, which are being recognized using a time elapsed inputs method from the October 2023 extension date through April 2026, the remaining period of the collaboration.

The Company recognized $
20.7
 million, $
11.7
 million and $
22.5
 million of collaboration revenue in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss related to the 2016 Regeneron Agreement, the 2020 Regeneron Amendment and the 2024 Technology Collaboration Extension.

As of December 31, 2024, there was approximately $
26.4
 million of the aggregate transaction price remaining to be recognized that will be recognized through April 2026, the remaining period of the collaboration.

In September 2023, Regeneron and Intellia further expanded the research collaboration (the “2023 Regeneron Amendment”) to develop additional 
in vivo
 CRISPR-based gene editing therapies focused on neurological and muscular diseases. The collaboration will leverage Intellia’s proprietary Nme2 CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing systems adapted for viral vector delivery and designed to precisely modify a target gene and Regeneron’s proprietary antibody-targeted adeno-associated virus vectors and delivery systems; each party will have the opportunity to lead potential development and commercialization for one product candidate, and the party that is not leading development and commercialization will have the option to enter into a co-development and co-promotion agreement for the target.
2023 Regeneron Amendment: Accounting Analysis
. The Company concluded that the accounting for the 2023 Regeneron Amendment is within the scope of ASC 606. The Company identified one performance obligation, the transfer of the license and performance of collaborative research and development activities. There is no upfront consideration related to the 2023 Regeneron Amendment. As the 2023 Regeneron Amendment progresses, the Company and Regeneron will share research costs equally. Any cost reimbursements received from Regeneron will be recorded as a component of revenue and any payments made to Regeneron will be recorded as a reduction of revenue.

The Company recognized $
2.3
 million and $
0.4
 million of collaboration revenue in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss related to the 2023 Regeneron Amendment.

ATTR and Hemophilia Co/Co Agreements: Accounting Analysis. 
The Company concluded that the ATTR Co/Co and Hemophilia Co/Co agreements meet the definition of a collaborative arrangement per ASC 808, which is outside of the scope of ASC 606. Since ASC 808 does not provide recognition and measurement guidance for collaborative arrangements, the Company has analogized to ASC 606. As such, the Company classifies cumulative amounts paid or received under the cost sharing provisions of the ATTR Co/Co and the Hemophilia Co/Co agreements as a component of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Company terminated the hemophilia B Co/Co agreement in September 2024. The Company will continue to support Regeneron with the development of gene editing products directed to hemophilia B, as applicable, under the 2016 Regeneron Agreement.
The Company recognized $
21.9
 million, $
19.6
 million, and $
11.9
 million, respectively, primarily representing payments due from Regeneron pursuant to the ATTR Co/Co agreement, in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The Company recognized contra-revenue related to the Hemophilia Co/Co agreements amounting to approximately $
11.7
 million in the year ended December 31, 2024, $
10.7
 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 and $
10.4
 million in the year ended December 31, 2022
.

As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023
, the Company had accounts receivable of $
7.2
 million and $
35.7
 million, respectively, and deferred revenue of $
26.4
 million and $
47.1
 million, respectively, related to the Regeneron Agreements.

SparingVision SAS
In October 2021, the Company and SparingVision, a genomic medicine company developing vision saving treatments for ocular diseases, entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the “SparingVision LCA”) to develop novel genomic medicines utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 technology for the treatment of ocular diseases.

The Company granted SparingVision exclusive rights to its proprietary 
in vivo
 CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing technology for up to three ocular targets addressing diseases with significant unmet medical need. In addition, the parties will research and develop novel self-inactivating adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) vectors and lipid nanoparticle (“LNP”)-based approaches to address delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing reagents to the retina.

SparingVision will lead and fund the preclinical and clinical development for the genome editing product candidates pursued under the collaboration.

The Company will have an option to obtain exclusive

U.S. commercialization rights for product candidates arising from two of three collaboration targets. 
For product candidates the Company chooses to option, it will pay an opt-in fee between $
10.0
 million and $
20.0
 million depending on the stage of development of the target, reimburse certain costs, share in 
50
% of development costs and pay royalties to SparingVision on U.S. sales.
In exchange for the license, the Company received 
83,316
 shares of SparingVision’s Series A2 Preferred Stock (“Series A2”). Attached to each share of Series A2, the Company received three warrants for the right to purchase additional Series A2 shares at designated prices that are subject to certain vesting conditions. 
The Company will also be eligible to receive certain research, development and commercial milestone payments (up to approximately $
200.0
 million per product) as well as royalties on potential future sales of products arising from the collaboration.
SparingVision LCA: Accounting Analysis. 
The Company determined that the accounting for the SparingVision LCA is within the scope of ASC 606. The Company evaluated the promised goods and services and determined that it included one performance obligation: a combined performance obligation including the license to the CRISPR technology as well as ongoing research and support services, including participation in a joint steering committee (“JSC”).
The transaction price was determined to be $
14.8
 million, which represents the fair value of the Company's equity interest in SparingVision at the time of closing. The Company allocated the full transaction price to the combined performance obligation, which was recorded as deferred revenue upon execution of the agreement. The Company will use a costs-incurred input method to recognize revenue, measuring the progress of the programs based on the costs incurred against budget, which in management's judgment is the best measure of progress towards satisfying the performance obligation.

Effective November 2024, SparingVision provided notice to the Company to terminate one of their three ocular targets due to a reprioritization strategy.
The Company recognized $
2.5
 million, $
1.8
 million and $
0.2
 million in revenue related to the SparingVision LCA for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023
, the Company had $
0.6
 million and $
0.5
 million in accounts receivable, respectively, related to the SparingVision LCA. 
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023
, the Company had deferred revenue of $
12.5
 million and $
13.9
 million, respectively, related to the SparingVision LCA, which is expected to be recognized over a six to nine year period from the signing of the agreement.
ReCode Therapeutics, Inc. (“ReCode”)
On February 14, 2024, the Company entered into a license, collaboration and option agreement with ReCode (the “ReCode LCA”), a clinical-stage genetic medicines company, to develop novel genomic medicines for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (“CF”). The ReCode LCA leverages the Company’s proprietary CRISPR-based gene editing platform, including its deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) writing technology, and ReCode’s proprietary Selective Organ Targeting (“SORT”) LNP delivery platform to precisely correct one or more CF disease-causing gene mutations. As part of the agreement, the companies will focus initial research efforts on therapeutic approaches that address CF for patients who have limited or no treatment options available, with the opportunity to expand the scope of the collaboration in later phases. The Company will be responsible for the design of the editing strategy and research-grade components for the investigational therapies. ReCode will lead the subsequent preclinical and clinical development and worldwide commercialization for certain programs arising from the collaboration. The Company also has an option to lead commercialization in the U.S. for certain programs (the “Co/Co option”).
The ReCode LCA did not include an exchange of upfront consideration between the parties. The Company will be eligible to receive pre-specified development and commercial milestone payments, up to $
262.0
 million 
per product, as well as single digit

F-
23

royalties 
on potential sales. Certain milestone and royalty payments may be removed or reduced for a product if the Company exercises the Co/Co option. The Company is entitled to cost reimbursements for certain research activities, which will be recorded as revenue. 
The Company did not recognize material revenue from the ReCode LCA during the 
year ended December 31, 2024.
Other Agreements
The Company has existing license and collaboration agreements with AvenCell, Kyverna, and ONK Therapeutics, Ltd. (“ONK”). Since December 31, 2023, there have been no material changes to the key terms of the AvenCell, Kyverna and ONK license and collaboration agreements. For further information on the terms and conditions of these agreements, see the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company’s Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023.
During the year
 ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $
21.0
 million of previously eliminated intra-entity profit related to its 
license and collaboration agreement with AvenCell (the “AvenCell LCA”)
 in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized $
13.2
 million and $
22.8
 million in revenue related to the AvenCell LCA, after eliminating $
6.6
 million and $
11.4
 million in intra-entity profits during those respective periods. The eliminated revenue was deferred and excluded from the results of operations of the Company until the first quarter of 2024. The Company did 
no
t recognize material revenue related to materials shipments under the AvenCell LCA during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and did 
no
t recognize material contra-revenue under the AvenCell Co/Co agreement during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The Company recognized $
2.0
 million of contra-revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company had 
no
 material accounts receivable from AvenCell or accrued expenses related to AvenCell agreements as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
The Company did 
no
t recognize material revenue from Kyverna during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 and recognized $
6.6
 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company did 
no
t recognize material revenue from ONK during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Kyverna Therapeutics, Inc.

In February 2024, Kyverna completed an initial public offering of its common stock (the “Kyverna IPO”). Prior to the Kyverna IPO, the Company accounted for its investment in Kyverna using the measurement alternative as Kyverna was a private company with no readily observable transaction price, and the investment was valued at $
10.0
 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. As of 
December 31, 2024, the Company’s investment in Kyverna is valued at 
$
4.4
 million
. The Company recognized an unrealized loss of 
$
5.6
 million
, recorded within “change in fair value of investments, net” in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2024, associated with changes in the fair value of Kyverna’s common stock.
AvenCell Therapeutics, Inc.
As of December 31, 2023
, the Company held a 
33.33
% equity interest in AvenCell and accounted for its investment using the equity method of accounting, as the Company had significant influence, but not control, over AvenCell, and the investment was valued at $
11.8
 million. 
During the first quarter of 2024, in conjunction with the completion of a debt financing, AvenCell increased the size of their board, with a single investor having control over AvenCell’s operational and financial decisions. From that point forward, the Company no longer had the ability to exercise significant influence over AvenCell, and therefore the Company’s investment in AvenCell has been accounted for in accordance with ASC 321, 
Investments in Equity Securities
 (“ASC 321”) and AvenCell is no longer considered to be a related party.
The transition from equity method accounting to ASC 321 required the Company to reclassify $
2.1
 million from accumulated other comprehensive loss amounts and recognize $
21.0
 million 
of previously eliminated intra-entity profit, both of which resulted in an increase in the carrying value of the investment in AvenCell. In the fourth quarter of 2024, AvenCell completed a Series B

F-
24

financing, 
which represented an observable price change in the investment in AvenCell. As a result of this observable price change, the carrying value of the Company’s investment in AvenCell was reduced to 
$
7.9
 million. 
The Company recognized an unrealized loss of $
27.0
 million, recorded within “Change in fair value of investments, net” 
in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss during the year ended December 31, 2024, associated with changes in the fair value of its investment in AvenCell.
SparingVision SAS
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Company’s investment in SparingVision, included within “Other investments” in the table above, was 
$
14.6
 million
.

11. Leases
Property Leases
The Company leases approximately 
230,000
 square feet of real estate, including laboratory and office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the surrounding areas. The Company’s leases have remaining terms ranging from

approximately one to twelve years. Certain leases include options to renew, exercised at the Company’s sole discretion, with varying renewal terms that can extend the lease term for an additional three to five years. All of the Company’s leases qualify as operating leases.
Throughout the term of its leases, the Company is responsible for paying certain costs and expenses, in addition to the rent, as specified in the lease, including a proportionate share of applicable taxes, operating expenses and utilities. The variable portion of these costs are expensed as incurred and are disclosed as variable lease costs.
In February 2022 and subsequently amended in June 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to lease approximately 
140,000
 square feet of office, general laboratory and manufacturing space at 840 Winter Street in Waltham
, Massachusetts (the “840 Winter Lease”). In November 2024 the Company determined, in accordance with ASC 842, that the criteria for commencement of the lease had been met as the lessor had made the space available for the Company’s use. The Company recorded a right of use asset of $
125.7
 million and a lease liability of $
113.1
 million related to the 840 Winter Lease. The difference between the right-of-use asset and the lease liability of $
12.6
 million relates to prepaid rent. The initial term of the 840 Winter Lease was 
twelve years
, ending in 
September 2036
. 
The Company had 
options to extend
 the lease for two five-year terms, which were not reasonably certain of exercise as of the commencement date.
 The 840 Winter Lease is subject to 
3
% fixed rate rent escalations and requires the Company to make monthly payments for operating costs such as real estate taxes, maintenance costs, and utilities. These costs are variable in nature and have therefore been excluded from consideration in the contract. 
Refer to Note 16 for further information regarding the 840 Winter Lease.
In January 2023, the Company executed a sublease for approximately 
13,000
 square feet of laboratory and office space in Cambridge, Massachusetts for a term of approximately three years. The sublease agreement grants an option to renew the term for one additional year.

The Company awards RSUs with a service condition to new employees upon hire, non-employee directors upon appointment, and to existing employees and non-employee directors as part of their annual grant. RSUs with a service condition granted to new and existing employees, and to non-employee directors upon appointment, under the 2015 Plan in 2024 and 2023 and the Inducement Plan in 2024 generally vest as to one-third on the first anniversary of the original vesting date, with the balance vesting annually over the remaining two years. RSUs granted to non-employee directors with a service condition as part of their annual grant generally vest on the first anniversary of the original vesting date.
In the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company granted 
2,828,675
 RSUs with a service condition to new and existing employees and non-employee directors, which have the potential to vest over a period of 
one
 to 
three years
. The weighted average grant date fair value of these RSUs was $
29.90
.
Unvested restricted stock units as of December 31, 2024 in the table above includes 
4,596,901
 RSUs that are service-based.
Restricted Stock Units - Market Awards
In 2024, 2023 and 2022, market-based RSUs were granted to senior executives
. These RSUs have the potential to vest after a period of 
three years
, with a vesting start date of January 1, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and the number of shares to be delivered will depend on the Company
’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”), a market condition, over that period relative to a defined group of biotechnology companies. The number of market-based RSUs granted in the year ended December 31, 2024
, 2023 and 2022 was 
286,084
, 
181,743
 and 
55,144
, respectively. The grant date fair value for the market-based RSUs, calculated using a Monte Carlo valuation model, was $
51.12
, $
68.55
 and $
126.49
, respectively. The following assumptions were used to determine the grant date fair value for the three years, respectively: risk free interest rate: 
4.28
%, 
4.60
% and 
1.44
%; expected volatility: 
77.2
%, 
84.34
% and 
82.53
%. The expected term for all grants was approximately 
3.0
 years; the expected dividend yield was 
0.0
%.
Unvested restricted stock units as of December 31, 2024 in the table above includes 
468,277
 RSUs that are market-based.
Restricted Stock Units - Performance-Based Awards with TSR Multiplier
Also in 2024, performance-based RSUs (“PSUs”) with a relative TSR modifier were granted to senior executives. The number of PSUs with a relative TSR modifier granted in the year ended December 31, 2024
 was 
486,617
. These PSUs, to the extent earned, shall vest on January 1, 2027, and the number of shares to be delivered will be determined based upon the achievement of certain performance goals, which can range from 
0
% to 
200
%. Following the determination of the achievement of performance criteria, the amount of shares awarded will be subject to adjustment based on the application of a TSR modifier, which can range from 
75
% to 
125
%. The grant date fair value for these PSUs, calculated using a Monte Carlo valuation model, was $
36.16
. The following assumptions were used to determine the grant date fair value: risk free interest rate: 
4.28
%; expected volatility: 
77.2
%; 
expected term: approximately 
3.0
 years; expected dividend yield: 
0.0
%. 
The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the required service period based on its estimate of the number of shares that will vest based upon the probability of achieving the performance goals.

Unvested restricted stock units as of December 31, 2024 in the table above includes 
437,934
 PSUs with a TSR multiplier.
Restricted Stock Units - Performance-Based Awards
In 2022, the Company granted 
66,296
 performance-based RSUs to certain non-executive employees that would vest upon obtaining certain scientific milestones. There were 
two
 separate tranches, each attached to a different set of milestones. The milestone related to the first tranche, made up of 
21,878
 RSUs, was achieved in the first quarter of 2023 and these RSUs vested. The remaining performance milestones were considered not probable of achievement as of 
December 31, 2024 and, therefore, no related stock-based compensation expense was recorded during the period then ending.

Unvested restricted stock units as of December 31, 2024 in the table above includes 
44,418
 performance-based RSUs.
The weighted-average grant date fair value of all RSUs granted during the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was 
$
32.43
, $
41.30
 and $
70.90
, respectively. The total fair value of RSUs vested (measured on the date of vesting) for the 
year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was 
$
40.0
 million
, $
24.9
 million and $
10.4
 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2024, there was 
$
106.5
 million
 of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to all RSUs that are expected to vest. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average remaining vesting period of 
1.6

years
.
Stock Options
The weighted average grant date fair value of options, estimated as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, was 
$
21.21
, $
28.92
 and $
57.23
 per option for those options granted during the 
year ended December 31, 2024
, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 
Weighted average assumptions used to apply this pricing model were as follows:

Risk-free Interest Rate.
  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with maturities approximately equal to the option’s expected term.
Expected Term.
  The expected term represents the period that stock option awards are expected to be outstanding. For option grants that are considered to be “plain vanilla,” the Company determines the expected term using the simplified method. The simplified method deems the term to be the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. The Company uses the simplified method because it does not have sufficient historical option exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term.
Expected Volatility.
  Expected volatility is estimated based on actual movements in the Company’s stock price over the most recent historical periods, over the expected term of their stock option grants.
Expected Dividend Yield.
  The Company has not paid cash dividends and has no intention to pay cash dividends in the future.
Stock options generally vest as to one-third on the first anniversary of the original vesting date, with the balance vesting monthly over the remaining two years, unless they contain specific vesting provisions. The maximum term of stock options granted under the 2015 Plan and the Inducement Plan is ten years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan
In May 2016, the Company adopted the 2016 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2016 Plan”). 
The 2016 Plan allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock on the last day of each predetermined six-month offering period at 
85
% of the lower of the fair market value per share at the beginning or end of the applicable offering period.
 The 2016 Plan provides for six-month offering periods beginning in January and July of each year.
As of December 31, 2024
, there were 
856,897
 shares available for future issuance under the 2016 Plan. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the 2016 Plan will be cumulatively increased on each January 1
st
 by the lesser of a) one percent of the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding on the immediately preceding December 31
st
, b) 
500,000
 shares of common stock, or c) such lesser number of shares of common stock as determined by the board of directors.
During the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company issued 
220,590
, 
142,079
 and 
77,618
 shares of common stock under the 2016 Plan, respectively. The weighted-average purchase prices of shares issued under the 2016 Plan were

, $
27.65
 and $
34.15
 per share 
for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

13. Loss Per Share
The Company calculates basic loss per share by dividing net loss for each respective period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for each respective period. The Company computes diluted loss per share after giving consideration to the dilutive effect of stock options and unvested restricted stock units that are outstanding during the period, except where such securities would be anti-dilutive.

15. 401(k) Plan

In 2015, the Company established the Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”) for its employees, which is designed to be qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Eligible employees are permitted to contribute to the 401(k) Plan within statutory and 401(k) Plan limits. The Company makes matching contributions of

16. Subsequent Events
Strategic Reorganization
In January 2025, the Company announced the prioritization of its current and near-term clinical programs and a strategic restructuring to streamline its operations. The pipeline prioritization is intended to focus resources on high value programs, NTLA-2002 and nex-z, to ensure efficient execution, achieve near-term clinical milestones, and prepare Intellia for commercial launch. As part of this prioritization, the Company discontinued development of NTLA-3001 for the treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated lung disease and select research-stage programs.
In connection with this portfolio prioritization and strategic restructuring, the Company implemented a net reduction of its employee headcount by approximately 
27
%, which will take place over 2025. The Company estimates that it will incur charges of approximately $
8.0
 million for severance and other employee termination-related costs, primarily in the first quarter of 2025. These costs consist primarily of cash expenditures related to severance payments. The Company estimates that the workforce reduction will be substantially completed in the first quarter of 2025. The estimate of costs that the Company expects to incur, and the timing thereof, are subject to a number of assumptions and actual results may differ. The Company may also incur additional costs not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of, or that are associated with, the actions described above.

Under the terms of the Tech Square Lease, the Company will initially lease approximately 
101,000
 square feet at 400 Tech Square (the “Initial Tech Square Premises”), which will supplement, and eventually replace certain parts of, the Company’s current leased premises in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
 In addition, the Tech Square Lease will expand, in two tranches, to include approximately 
46,000
 square feet of additional office and laboratory space at 400 Tech Square (the “Additional Tech Square Premises”) when each such space becomes available.
 The Tech Square Lease is expected to commence on 
July 1, 2025
 (the “Commencement Date”) with respect to the Initial Tech Square Premises, and the Company’s obligation to pay rent will start on the date that is approximately 14 months after the Commencement Date (the “Rent Commencement Date”).
 In addition, the lease of the Additional Tech Square Premises will commence when the Tech Square Landlord delivers such space to the Company, which is anticipated to occur in December 2027 and January 2028 (in each case, an “Additional Premises Commencement Date”), and the Company’s obligation to pay rent for such Additional Tech Square Premises will start on the date that is approximately 14 months after each Additional Premises Commencement Date (in each case, an “Additional Premises Rent Commencement Date”).
 The Company shall not be obligated to pay the base rent for the applicable premises for three months after the Rent Commencement Date and each Additional Premises Rent Commencement Date, as applicable. The initial term of the Tech Square Lease is 
twelve years
 and 
three months
 following the Rent Commencement Date, and the Company has an option to extend the Tech Square Lease for an additional term of 
five years

108.00
 per square foot per year, plus certain operating expenses and taxes; provided that the initial base rent may adjust based on certain criteria set forth in the lease. The base rent is subject to scheduled annual increases of 
3
% on the anniversary of the Commencement Date. In addition, the Tech Square Landlord will contribute up to $
