Overview

Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “Intellia,” or the “Company”) is a leading clinical-stage gene editing company focused on revolutionizing medicine with CRISPR-based therapies. CRISPR is a gene editing technology which is also sometimes referred to as CRISPR/Cas or CRISPR/Cas9 when referring to the use of CRISPR technology with the Cas9 enzyme. Since its inception, Intellia has focused on leveraging gene editing technology to develop novel, first-in-class medicines that address important unmet medical needs and advance the treatment paradigm for patients. Intellia’s deep scientific, technical and clinical development experience, along with its people, are helping set the standard for a new class of medicine. To harness the full potential of gene editing, Intellia continues to expand the capabilities of its CRISPR-based platform with novel editing and delivery technologies.

Our mission is to transform the lives of people with severe diseases by developing potentially curative genome editing treatments.

Our lead 
in vivo
 product candidates, nexiguran ziclumeran (“nex-z”, also referred to as NTLA-2001) for the treatment of transthyretin (“ATTR”) amyloidosis and NTLA-2002 for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (“HAE”), are the first CRISPR-based therapy candidates to be administered systemically, via intravenous (“IV”) infusion, for precision editing of a gene in a target tissue in humans.

In addition, we are advancing 
ex vivo
 programs, wholly owned and in collaboration with partners, to develop product candidates for the treatment of immuno-oncology and autoimmune diseases, and multiple 
in vivo 
programs, also wholly owned and in collaboration with partners, to address diseases with significant unmet medical need by delivering gene editing therapeutics to organs outside the liver.

For over a decade, we have been applying novel technologies, such as CRISPR-based gene editing technologies and lipid nanoparticle (“LNP”) delivery technologies, to develop 
in vivo 
and 
ex vivo
 product candidates. Our 
in vivo
 product candidates address genetic diseases by deploying our technologies, including CRISPR/Cas9 delivered by LNPs, as the therapy for diseases with high unmet need. For our 
ex vivo
 product candidates, we apply our technologies to create engineered cell therapies to address immuno-oncology and autoimmune diseases. Our deep scientific, technical and clinical development experience have enabled us to develop first-in-class therapeutic applications of CRISPR/Cas9 and our other technologies, opening a new frontier in genetic medicine.

Treating—and potentially curing—a broad range of severe diseases requires the application of multiple technologies. With our proprietary technologies at the core of our platform, we continue to research and develop new gene editing and delivery technologies to expand our therapeutic opportunities, furthering progress on the frontier of genetic medicine and generating additional development candidates.

Strategy

Our strategy is to develop and commercialize our product candidates and further our gene editing technology to develop new product candidates, expanding the application of gene editing medicine. Our approach to realizing the broad potential of genome editing includes:

Focusing on Developing and Commercializing Our Lead 
In Vivo 
Product Candidates, Enabling the Potential of the CRISPR/Cas9 System.
 We are focused on successfully completing late-stage clinical development of our lead product candidates, nex-z for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis and NTLA-2002 for the treatment of HAE. As the only 
in vivo
 genome editing product candidates in Phase 3 clinical trials, our lead product candidates are positioned at the forefront of genomic medicine. Our strategy involves building a foundation designed to position us for the successful commercial launch of our product candidates.

Progressing 
Ex Vivo
 Therapeutic Programs.
 We are researching proprietary engineered cell therapies to treat various cancers and autoimmune diseases. We are deploying our LNP-based cell engineering platform and a proprietary allogeneic technology, a first-of-its-kind solution designed to avoid immune rejection by both T cells and natural killer (“NK”) cells, to advance a pipeline of wholly owned and partnered 
ex vivo
 programs. We are pursuing targeting modalities, such as T cell receptors (“TCRs”) and chimeric antigen receptors (“CARs”), with broad potential in multiple immuno-oncology and autoimmune

indications.

Advancing the Science of Genome Editing.
 Since our founding, we have been at the scientific forefront of genome editing. Our scientific co-founder, Dr. Jennifer Doudna, and her collaborators developed the Nobel Prize-winning CRISPR/Cas9 system. The versatility of this groundbreaking genome editing system opened the door to numerous scientific breakthroughs and provided the foundation of our genome editing therapeutics, including those that led to our first-in-class clinical product candidates. The versatility of the CRISPR/Cas9 system is exemplified by the diverse types of edits it can facilitate, including knockouts, repairs and insertions, which can be accomplished solely by the endonuclease activity of the Cas9 enzyme or by fusing variants of the Cas9 enzyme to other proteins that can edit double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) at specific locations in various ways. CRISPR/Cas9 systems comprise a Cas9 enzyme, or a variant thereof, and a ribonucleic acid (“RNA”) molecule, called a guide RNA (“gRNA”). The complex formed by the Cas9 enzyme and the gRNA enable CRISPR/Cas9 systems’ features by precisely targeting and binding a specific sequence in double-stranded DNA.

We continue to advance the science of genome editing, and therapeutic applications of CRISPR/Cas9 systems, in order to maximize our opportunity to develop clinically successful products. In executing this research strategy, we have applied a risk-mitigated approach to selecting indications with significant unmet medical needs based on four primary criteria:

•
the type of edit: knockout, repair or insertion;

•
the delivery modality for 
in vivo
 and 
ex vivo
 applications;

•
the existence of efficient regulatory pathways to approval; and

•
the potential for the CRISPR/Cas9 system to provide improved therapeutic benefits over existing therapeutic options.

We believe these selection criteria position us to build a diversified pipeline, in which we are not reliant on any single delivery technology or editing approach for success. This approach has the potential to increase the probabilities of success in our initial indications and generate insights that will accelerate the development of additional therapeutic products. Specifically, we believe we can apply the learnings from our current programs to inform our selection of additional indications and targets of interest.

We have built a broad genome editing toolbox, which enables us to select the best tools to develop novel product candidates for each therapeutic application. We continue to invest selectively in developing and deploying our platform capabilities, including innovative genome editing, delivery and cell engineering technologies to advance new therapeutic programs. We will also continue to explore accessing external technologies or opportunities to enhance our leadership position in developing innovative therapeutics.

Hereditary Angioedema (“HAE”) Program

Background

HAE is a rare, genetic disease characterized by severe, recurring and unpredictable inflammatory attacks in various organs and tissues of the body, which can be painful, debilitating and life-threatening. The most common areas of the body to develop swelling are the limbs, face, intestinal tract and airway. Minor trauma or stress may trigger an attack but swelling often occurs without a known trigger. Episodes involving the intestinal tract cause severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Swelling in the airway can restrict breathing and lead to life-threatening obstruction of the airway. The disease is caused by increased levels of bradykinin, a protein which leads to swelling. Most patients with HAE have a deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor (“C1-INH”) protein, which normally prevents the overproduction of bradykinin that causes the recurring, debilitating and potentially fatal swelling attacks in people living with HAE. It is estimated that approximately one in 50,000 people are affected by HAE.

Limitations of Current Treatment Options

Current treatment options often include life-long therapies, which may require chronic IV or subcutaneous (“SC”) administration as often as twice per week, or daily oral administration to ensure constant pathway suppression for disease control. Despite chronic administration, breakthrough attacks still occur. Kallikrein inhibition is a clinically validated strategy for the preventive treatment of HAE attacks.

Our Approach

NTLA-2002 is a wholly owned, investigational 
in vivo
 CRISPR-based therapy designed to knock out the 
kallikrein B1 (“KLKB1”)
 gene in the liver, with the goal of achieving lifelong control of HAE attacks after a single dose. It also aims to eliminate the significant treatment burden associated with currently available HAE therapies.

About the NTLA-2002 Clinical Program

In October 2024, we announced the initiation of the Phase 3 HAELO study of NTLA-2002. HAELO is a global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NTLA-2002 in 60 adults with Type I or Type II HAE. Patients will be randomized 2:1 to receive a single 50 mg infusion of NTLA-2002 or placebo. Patients randomized to the placebo arm will be eligible for optional crossover to NTLA-2002 at week 28. The primary endpoint is the number of HAE attacks from week 5 through week 28. In January 2025, we announced that the first patient had been dosed in the global Phase 3 study. We expect to complete enrollment in the second half of 2025 and submit a biologics license application (“BLA”) in the second half of 2026 to support plans for a potential United States (“U.S.”) launch in 2027.

Also in October 2024, we presented positive Phase 2 data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 study of NTLA-2002, with results continuing to support the potential of NTLA-2002 to be a functional cure for HAE in most patients. Eight of 11 patients in the 50 mg arm ceased having any attacks during the 16-week primary observation period after a single dose of NTLA-2002. These eight patients continued to be attack-free as of the cutoff date. NTLA-2002 was well tolerated. The most frequent adverse events (“AEs”) were headache, fatigue and nasopharyngitis. There have been no serious AEs, and all AEs were either Grade 1 or 2. These interim data were published in The New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the 2024 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (“ACAAI”) Scientific Meeting in Boston, Massachusetts.

We expect to present longer-term data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 study in 2025, which will include patients in the Phase 2 portion who initially received a 25 mg dose or placebo and were subsequently given the 50 mg dose of NTLA-2002 selected for the Phase 3 study.

We have received five regulatory designations for NTLA-2002, including orphan designation in the European Union (“EU”) granted by the European Commission (“EC”) in November 2023. NTLA-2002 was also granted orphan designation and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Innovation Passport by the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”), as well as access to the Priority Medicine (“PRIME”) program by the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”). Access to the PRIME program is granted by the EMA to drug candidates that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments or that benefit patients without treatment options.

Transthyretin (“ATTR”) Amyloidosis Program

Background

ATTR amyloidosis is a progressive and fatal disorder resulting from deposition of insoluble amyloid fibrils into multiple organs and tissues leading to systemic failure. Blood-borne transthyretin (“TTR”) protein is produced by hepatocytes and normally circulates as a soluble homotetramer that facilitates transport of vitamin A, via retinol binding protein, as well as the thyroid hormone, thyroxine. Mutations in the 
TTR
 gene lead to the production of TTR proteins that are destabilized in their tetramer form. These tetramers more readily dissociate into the monomeric form, and thence to an aggregative form that results in amyloid deposits in tissues. These deposits cause damage in those tissues, resulting in a disorder known as hereditary ATTR amyloidosis (“ATTRv”). Over 120 different genetic mutations are currently known to cause ATTRv.

Deposits of TTR amyloid in the heart, nerves and/or other tissues can lead to diverse disease manifestations, including two main hereditary forms – ATTRv with polyneuropathy (“ATTRv-PN”), and ATTRv with cardiomyopathy (“ATTRv-CM”). Typical onset of disease symptoms is during adulthood and can be fatal within two to 15 years. Estimates suggest that approximately 50,000 patients suffer from ATTRv worldwide.

In addition to the hereditary forms described above, ATTR amyloidosis can also develop spontaneously in the absence of any 
TTR
 gene mutation. This wild-type ATTR (“ATTRwt”) is increasingly being recognized as a significant and often undiagnosed cause of heart failure in the elderly and is the subject of active investigation. Recent estimates suggest that, globally, between 250,000 and 500,000 people may suffer from ATTRwt with cardiomyopathy (“ATTRwt-CM”).

Limitations of Current Treatment Options

Currently, there are three marketed therapies for the treatment of ATTRv-PN approved in the U.S., and five approved in most major markets outside of the U.S. While these therapies have shown the potential to slow or halt the progression of neuropathic symptoms, and in some patients lead to an improvement in symptoms, their approved prescribing instructions require them to be administered chronically for the life of the patient in order to sustain benefit. Additionally, patient response to these therapies varies. While some patients may experience symptomatic improvement after being treated with these therapies, the disease continues to progress in many of the treated patients, which highlights the continued need for efficacious and potentially curative

9

therapies. At present, there are two therapies approved for ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (“ATTR-CM”) (including both ATTRv-CM and ATTRwt-CM) which have shown the ability to improve patient outcomes, though most patients still appear to have the progressive disease. As with the treatments for ATTRv-PN, chronic, lifetime dosing is required to sustain the therapeutic effects.

Our Approach

Nex-z is an investigational CRISPR-based therapy designed to inactivate the 
TTR
 gene in liver cells, thereby preventing the production of TTR protein for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis. Delivered with our 
in vivo
 LNP technology, nex-z offers the possibility of halting and reversing the disease by driving a deep, consistent and potentially lifelong reduction in TTR protein after a single dose. Using this approach, we aim to address ATTR amyloidosis regardless of the disease manifestation. It has been clinically validated that a significant correlation between TTR protein reduction and therapeutic benefit exists. Additionally, these studies suggest that loss of 
TTR
 gene expression from the liver would be well-tolerated in adult humans. We believe our approach may improve patient outcomes by significantly and consistently reducing TTR protein after a single dose, as opposed to life-long, chronic therapy.

About the Nex-z Clinical Program

ATTR Amyloidosis with Cardiomyopathy (“ATTR-CM”):

In 2024, we initiated the pivotal Phase 3 MAGNITUDE trial. The MAGNITUDE trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nex-z in adults with ATTR-CM. The primary endpoint of the study is a composite of cardiovascular (“CV”)-related mortality and events. Patients will be randomized 2:1 nex-z:placebo, with a single 55 mg infusion of nex-z administered. In March 2024, the first patients in the U.S. and globally were dosed. The MAGNITUDE trial is currently enrolling and we anticipate enrollment to exceed 550 total patients by the end of 2025.

In November 2024, we presented new data from the ATTR-CM arm of the ongoing Phase 1 study. Across all patients (n=36), a single dose of nex-z led to consistently rapid, deep and sustained serum TTR reduction, regardless of baseline levels, through the latest follow-up. At month 12, the mean serum TTR reduction was 90%, and the mean absolute residual serum TTR concentration was 17 µg/mL. With 11 patients who had reached 24 months of follow-up as of November 2024, all patients continued to show a sustained response with no evidence of a waning effect over time. The consistently low levels of serum TTR are anticipated to reduce the rate of ongoing amyloid formation and potentially allow for amyloid clearance and improvement in cardiac function. Nex-z was generally well tolerated across all patients.

Hereditary ATTR Amyloidosis with Polyneuropathy (“ATTRv-PN”):

In November 2024, we announced that the FDA has cleared our nex-z Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application to initiate the MAGNITUDE-2 pivotal Phase 3 trial for ATTRv-PN. MAGNITUDE-2 is an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nex-z in 50 adults with ATTRv-PN. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive a single 55 mg infusion of nex-z or placebo. Patients randomized to the placebo arm will be eligible for optional crossover to receive nex-z following month 18. The primary endpoints are the change from baseline in modified Neuropathy Impairment Score +7 (mNIS+7) at month 18 and serum TTR at day 29. The mNIS+7 scale is a validated measure specifically designed to assess and quantify polyneuropathy impairment, including muscle weakness, muscle stretch reflexes, sensory loss and autonomic impairment. We are actively screening patients for the Phase 3 MAGNITUDE-2 study and are on track to dose the first patient in the first quarter of 2025.

In November 2024, we presented new data from the ATTRv-PN arm of the ongoing Phase 1 study. Across patients who received a dose of 0.3 mg/kg or higher (n=33), the mean serum TTR reduction was 91% and the mean absolute residual serum TTR concentration was 20 µg/mL at month 12. With 16 patients who had reached 24 months of follow-up as of November 2024, all patients continued to show a sustained response with no evidence of a waning effect over time. It is anticipated that greater TTR reduction may lead to a greater clinical benefit in patients with ATTRv-PN. Nex-z was generally well tolerated across all patients and at all dose levels tested.

Nex-z has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis by both the FDA and the EC and has received RMAT designation from the FDA for the treatment of ATTRv-PN.

We expect to present longer-term data from both ATTR-CM and ATTRv-PN patients in the Phase 1 study in 2025, which will include updated measures of clinical efficacy and safety.

10

Nex-z is the subject of a co-development and co-promotion (“Co/Co”) agreement (the “ATTR Co/Co”) with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Regeneron”), for which we are the clinical and commercial lead party and Regeneron is the participating party. Regeneron shares in approximately 25% of worldwide development costs and commercial profits for the ATTR program and has an option to enter into a co-promotion agreement for the U.S. commercialization. For more information regarding our collaboration with Regeneron, see the section below entitled “

Ex Vivo 
Programs

We and our collaboration partners are advancing preclinical programs utilizing our allogeneic platform for the treatment of immuno-oncology and autoimmune diseases. Our proprietary allogeneic cell engineering platform avoids both T cell- and NK cell-mediated rejection in preclinical models, an unsolved challenge with other investigational allogeneic approaches. Cell therapies engineered with our allogeneic platform, combined with edits to enhance cell function, could offer a new approach to target both hematological and solid tumors. Our proprietary cell engineering technologies, including our LNP-based cell engineering platform and novel allogeneic solution, are designed to offer significant advantages over both autologous cell therapies and allogeneic approaches being investigated by others, and could be used to treat patients with cancer.

•
We are developing an allogeneic CAR T cell therapy, which uses cells derived from unrelated donors and modified outside of the human body to allow them to be administered to and persist in an unrelated patient. Preclinical data based on our differentiated allogeneic engineering platform applied a novel combination of gene edits, including knockout of specific human leukocyte antigen (“HLA”) Class I and II proteins to avoid rejection by T cells while retaining and matching one select HLA protein that is important for blocking NK cells. This strategy led to persistent allogeneic T cells, comparable to autologous T cells, in preclinical models. With our approach, we may be able to pursue a simplified HLA matching strategy between healthy donor T cells and recipient patients, allowing for the development of an “off-the-shelf” therapy that could address the majority of the patient population with only a small set of donors.

•
In addition, we strategically partner with others who possess complementary capabilities or technologies to bring forth innovative engineered cell therapy candidates outside of our core areas of focus, such as our collaborations with AvenCell Therapeutics, Inc., Kyverna Therapeutics, Inc., and ONK Therapeutics, Ltd.

We have shared preclinical data demonstrating that our LNP-based engineering technology is a significant improvement over electroporation, the standard engineering process used to introduce proteins and nucleic acids into cells. The resulting T cells engineered with LNPs had improved cell properties and performance both 
in vitro
 and 
in vivo 
as compared to electroporation. The LNP-based approach has been used in multiple 
ex vivo
 candidates in development by us and our collaborators.

Our Research Programs

We are expanding the range of diseases that can be targeted with our CRISPR-based technologies by expanding our genome editing and delivery technologies to develop new product candidates. This includes advancing gene editing programs in tissues outside the liver, either independently or in collaboration with partners, and using new gene editing technologies, including DNA writing.

We are committed to staying at the forefront of the genome editing revolution and will continue to advance our technology platform through a mix of both internal research and development and external opportunities in order to potentially serve more patients across a broad set of diseases. With proprietary CRISPR/Cas9-based technology at the core of our platform, we have built a comprehensive set of editing and delivery tools to expand our current solutions for therapeutic application. These additions include our proprietary base editor, as well as novel CRISPR-derivative enzymes, which provide us with the capabilities to achieve multiple editing strategies.

We have applied our comprehensive genome editing platform to discover and develop multiple product candidates with complex compositions, including LNPs comprising messenger RNA and gRNA as well as adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) vectors when required for insertion. The product candidates we discovered and developed, both wholly owned and together with our collaborators, apply a broad spectrum of genome editing approaches, including the knockout, insertion, and/or modification of genes. Based on both non-human primate (“NHP”) and rodent disease models, we have demonstrated the ability to knockout multiple targets in the liver, including 
TTR
, 
KLKB1
, 
SERPINA1
, hydroxyacid oxidase 1 (“
HAO1”)
 and lactate dehydrogenase A (“
LDHA”)
. We have also demonstrated in NHP and rodent preclinical models the ability to precisely insert a gene, including 
SERPINA1 
and 
Factor 9 (“F9”
), to produce normal human levels of the missing protein.

In addition, we have developed a leading LNP platform that has proven to be critical to the initial success of our, and our collaborators’, liver-focused product candidates, where we deliver the CRISPR/Cas9 therapy intravenously to patients using our

11

proprietary LNP platform. In our research programs, we are focusing on applying those learnings from our initial 
in vivo 
applications in the liver, to expand our delivery technology to develop product candidates that require delivery to tissues other than the liver. We believe that our proprietary LNP platform provides distinct advantages over other delivery technologies because, 
inter alia
, our LNPs provide our product candidates with stability, selective delivery, improved pharmacologic properties and controlled circulation time. LNPs are chemically well-defined and have a completely synthetic route of manufacture, which permits greater scalability, product quality and controls. LNPs are tunable, do not exhibit cargo size limitations and can co-formulate different nucleic acid components, such as messenger RNA and gRNAs. There is no pre-existing immunity to the LNP or limiting de novo immunity after dosing, allowing for repeat dosing as required by the therapeutic approach. We are currently advancing our programs using our proprietary LNP delivery system, which uses a set of biodegradable, well-tolerated lipids, based on lipids originally developed by Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc. (“Novartis”) and in-licensed by us for use with all genome editing technologies, including CRISPR/Cas9 products.

Collaborations and Other Arrangements

To accelerate the development and commercialization of CRISPR/Cas9-based products in multiple therapeutic areas, we have formed, and intend to seek other opportunities to form, strategic alliances with collaborators who can augment our leadership in CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutic development.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Regeneron”)

In April 2016, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Regeneron (as amended from time to time, the “2016 Regeneron Agreement”). The 2016 Regeneron Agreement has two principal components: (i) a product development component under which the parties will research, develop and commercialize CRISPR/Cas-based therapeutic products primarily focused on genome editing in the liver, and (ii) a technology collaboration component, pursuant to which we and Regeneron will engage in research-related activities aimed at discovering and developing novel technologies and improvements to CRISPR/Cas technology to enhance our genome editing platform. Under this agreement, we also may access the Regeneron Genetics Center and proprietary mouse models to be provided by Regeneron for a limited number of our liver programs. As currently amended, the technology collaboration, and related target selection rights, under the 2016 Regeneron Agreement extends until April 2026. In addition, the 2016 Regeneron Agreement has been amended to (a) increase the number of exclusive 
in vivo
 targets to which Regeneron may develop CRISPR/Cas-based therapeutic products to fifteen and (b) grant Regeneron a non-exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property (“IP”) to independently develop and commercialize up to 10 CRISPR/Cas-based 
ex vivo 
gene edited products made using certain defined cell types. In September 2023, we further amended the 2016 Regeneron Agreement (the “2023 Regeneron Amendment”) to expand the research and development collaboration to develop additional 
in vivo
 CRISPR-based gene editing therapies focused on neurological and muscular diseases. The expanded research and development collaboration leverages our proprietary Nme2 CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing systems adapted for viral vector delivery and designed to precisely modify a target gene and Regeneron’s proprietary antibody-targeted AAV vectors and delivery systems; each party will have the opportunity to lead potential development and commercialization for one product candidate, and the party that is not leading development and commercialization will have the option to enter into a co-development and co-commercialization agreement for the target. Under the 2016 Regeneron Agreement, we will be eligible to receive up to $320.0 million per 
in vivo 
target in development and commercial milestone payments, as well as up to mid-single-digit royalties on potential future sales.

In 2018, we entered into the ATTR Co/Co agreement with Regeneron. In May 2020, we entered into co-development and co-funding agreements for the treatment of hemophilia A and hemophilia B (the “Hemophilia Co/Co”) agreements. We terminated the hemophilia B Co/Co agreement in September 2024. We will continue to support Regeneron with the development of gene editing products directed to hemophilia B, as applicable, under the 2016 Regeneron Agreement.

AvenCell Therapeutics, Inc. (“AvenCell”)

AvenCell was formed in July 2021 as a joint venture between us, Cellex Cell Professionals GmbH (“Cellex”) and funds managed by Blackstone Life Sciences Advisors L.L.C. (“BXLS”). As part of our contribution to AvenCell, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the “AvenCell LCA”), under which we are collaborating with AvenCell to develop allogeneic universal CAR-T cell therapies and which granted AvenCell a license to develop and commercialize genome edited universal CAR-T cell therapies (limited to its use with their switchable, universal CAR-T cell UniCAR and RevCAR platforms). In exchange for the license, we received a 33.33% equity interest in AvenCell at the time of the initial closing. In the fourth quarter of 2024, AvenCell completed a Series B financing which resulted in our equity interest being reduced to below 10%.

We have one option to enter into an additional co-development and co-funding agreement for a payment of $30.0 million to AvenCell.

12

SparingVision SAS (“SparingVision”)

In October 2021, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with SparingVision, a genomic medicine company developing vision saving treatments for ocular diseases, to develop novel genomic medicines utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 technology for the treatment of ocular diseases. We granted SparingVision exclusive rights to our proprietary 
in vivo
 CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing technology for up to three ocular targets addressing diseases with significant unmet medical need. In addition, the parties are collaborating to research and develop novel self-inactivating AAV vectors and LNP-based product candidates to address delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing reagents to the retina. SparingVision will lead and fund the preclinical and clinical development for the genome editing product candidates pursued under the collaboration. We will also be eligible to receive certain research, development and commercial milestone cash payments (up to approximately $200.0 million per product) as well as royalties on potential future sales of products arising from the collaboration. We will have an option to obtain exclusive

U.S. commercialization rights for product candidates arising from two of three collaboration targets.

In December 2024 SparingVision provided notice to us to terminate one of their three ocular targets due to a reprioritization strategy, effective in November 2024.

Kyverna Therapeutics, Inc. (“Kyverna”)

In December 2021, we entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with Kyverna, a cell therapy company engineering a new class of therapies for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, for the development of an allogeneic CD19 CAR-T cell therapy for the treatment of a variety of B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. We granted Kyverna rights to our proprietary 
ex vivo 
CRISPR/Cas9-based allogeneic platform for the development of KYV-201, an allogeneic CD19 CAR-T cell investigational candidate for the treatment of select autoimmune diseases. Kyverna will lead and fund preclinical and clinical development for KYV-201 and we will be eligible to receive certain development and commercial milestone payments, as well as low-to-mid-single-digit royalties on potential future sales. We may also exercise an option to lead U.S. commercialization for KYV-201 under a co-development and co-commercialization agreement. If we choose to co-develop and co-commercialize KYV-201, we will pay an opt-in fee of $5.0 million and share in 50% of development costs and future net profit and/or loss arising from commercializing KYV-201 in the U.S. Kyverna would retain all rights outside of the U.S., and we would receive low-to-mid-single-digit royalties on net sales generated outside of the U.S.

ONK Therapeutics, Ltd. (“ONK”)

In February 2022, we announced a license, collaboration and option agreement with ONK for the development of engineered NK cell therapies to cure patients with cancer. The agreement grants ONK a non-exclusive license to our proprietary 
ex vivo
 CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing platform and our LNP-based delivery technologies for development of up to five allogeneic NK cell therapies. ONK will be responsible for preclinical and clinical development for the engineered NK cell therapies enabled by the agreement. We will be eligible to receive up to $184.0 million per product in development and commercial milestone payments, as well as up to mid-single-digit royalties on potential future sales. In addition, the agreement grants us options to co-develop and co-commercialize up to two products worldwide with rights to lead commercialization in the U.S.

Rewrite Therapeutics Inc. (“Rewrite”)

On February 2, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with, 
inter alia
, Rewrite (the “Rewrite Merger Agreement”). Under the Rewrite Merger Agreement, we agreed to pay Rewrite’s former stockholders and option holders (the “Rewrite Holders”) (a) upfront consideration in an aggregate amount of approximately $45.0 million payable in cash, excluding customary purchase price adjustments, and (b) up to an additional $155.0 million in milestone payments, including $55.0 million upon the achievement of certain pre-specified research milestones and $100.0 million upon achievement of a certain regulatory approval milestone, payable through a mixture of $130.0 million in cash and $25.0 million in shares of common stock. In September 2022, Rewrite merged into Intellia, with Intellia as the surviving entity. In January 2023, a $25.0 million research milestone was achieved and, in February 2023, we paid the Rewrite Holders a mixture of cash and 567,045 shares of common stock in order to fulfill this obligation.

ReCode Therapeutics, Inc. (“ReCode”)

On February 14, 2024, we entered into a license, collaboration and option agreement with ReCode (the “ReCode LCA”), a clinical-stage genetic medicines company, to develop novel genomic medicines for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (“CF”). The ReCode LCA leverages our proprietary CRISPR-based gene editing platform, including our DNA writing technology, and ReCode’s proprietary Selective Organ Targeting (“SORT”) LNP delivery platform to precisely correct one or more CF disease-causing gene mutations. As part of the agreement, ReCode and Intellia will focus initial research efforts on therapeutic approaches that address CF for patients who have limited or no treatment options available, with the opportunity to expand the scope of the collaboration in later phases. We will be responsible for the design of the editing strategy and research-grade components for the

investigational therapies. ReCode will lead the subsequent preclinical and clinical development and worldwide commercialization for certain programs arising from the collaboration and we will be eligible to receive certain development and commercial milestone payments, as well as low-to-mid-single-digit royalties on potential future sales. We also have an option to lead commercialization in the U.S. for certain programs (the “Co/Co option”).

Potential Future Collaborations

We view strategic partnerships as important drivers for helping accelerate our goal of rapidly treating patients. The potential application of CRISPR/Cas9 is extremely broad, and we plan to continue to identify partners who can contribute meaningful resources and insights to our programs and allow us to more rapidly bring scientific innovation to a broader patient population.

Intellectual Property

We believe we are well positioned in terms of our IP because we:

•
have built, and intend to expand, a broad worldwide portfolio of IP, including patents and patent applications, in areas relevant to the development and commercialization of human therapeutic products using CRISPR/Cas9 technology;

•
protect our IP by maintaining trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology innovations and know-how; and

•
intend to take additional steps, where appropriate, to further protect our IP rights, including, for example, through the use of copyright protection, trademark and regulatory protections available via orphan drug designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions.

We have a broad portfolio of wholly owned and in-licensed patents and patent applications, including foundational filings on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 systems for genome editing, as well as improvement to CRISPR/Cas9 systems, such as base editor and DNA writing technologies, and delivery technologies, including LNP technologies. We co-own some of these patent portfolios with our collaboration partners, such as Regeneron, and we have licensed some of these patent portfolios from licensors, including Caribou Biosciences, Inc. (“Caribou”) and others. If issued, patents resulting from our wholly owned patent portfolio, which may claim our product candidates, would expire no earlier than 2036.

We actively apply for, maintain, and plan to defend and enforce, as needed, our internally developed and externally licensed patent rights. Furthermore, we continue to search for and evaluate opportunities to in-license IP relevant to our therapeutic programs and platforms and to develop and acquire new IP in collaboration with third parties.

Caribou Biosciences In-Licensed Intellectual Property (“Caribou”)

In July 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Caribou (the “Caribou License”), as subsequently amended and supplemented, for an exclusive, worldwide license for human therapeutic, prophylactic, and palliative uses, except for anti-fungal and anti-microbial uses, defined in the license agreement as our field of use, of any CRISPR/Cas9-related patents and applications owned, controlled or licensed by Caribou as well as companion diagnostics to our product or product candidates.

The Caribou License includes an exclusive sublicense in our field of use to the Regents of the University of California (“UC”) and University of Vienna’s (“Vienna”) rights in U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications covering the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, which they co-own with Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier (collectively, the “UC/Vienna/Charpentier IP”). In July 2015, we exercised our option to include in the licensed Caribou patent portfolio the U.S. and foreign patent and patent applications owned or controlled by Pioneer Hi-Bred International (“Pioneer”) and its affiliates. We have the right to grant sublicenses to the licensed Caribou patent portfolio to third parties in our field of use. Caribou retains the right to practice the licensed IP in all other fields, including for its own specific therapeutic product candidates outside our field of use. The UC/Vienna/Charpentier IP and Pioneer IP, and our rights to the same, are further described below.

We have agreed to pay 30.0% of Caribou’s patent prosecution, filing and maintenance costs for the IP included in the license agreement. Any patents that grant or have granted from these applications will expire in or after 2034, assuming payment of necessary maintenance fees.

The Caribou License terminates on the expiration of the last-to-expire patent right that is licensed to either party. We must use commercially reasonable and diligent efforts to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize at least one product covered by the licensed IP. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach, bankruptcy or insolvency-related events, or breach of its obligations with respect to the included in-licenses.

14

In June 2021, we executed a Leaseback Agreement (“Leaseback”) with Caribou, concluding an arbitration between us and Caribou in which an arbitration panel found that Caribou had violated the terms of the Caribou License. The arbitration panel required us to grant Caribou an equitable “leaseback” to use certain IP exclusively licensed to us in Caribou’s ongoing CB-010 program.

The Regents of the University of California and the University of Vienna Intellectual Property

The UC/Vienna/Charpentier IP covers methods of use and compositions relating to engineered CRISPR/Cas9 systems for, among other things, cleaving or editing DNA and altering gene product expression in various organisms, including humans. The earliest claimed priority date for the patents in the UC/Vienna/Charpentier IP is May 25, 2012.

In April 2013, Caribou entered into an exclusive, worldwide license in all fields, with the right to sublicense, for this patent family with UC/Vienna solely under UC/Vienna ownership rights. Caribou’s license remains in effect for the life of the last-to-expire patent or last-to-be-abandoned patent application licensed, whichever is later. As noted above, under the Caribou License, we have an exclusive, worldwide sublicense to UC/Vienna’s interest in this foundational CRISPR/Cas9 patent family in our field of use. For therapeutic products covered by this license and their companion diagnostics, we will owe mid-single-digit royalties on net sales. We may also be subject to additional milestone payments in the future. Caribou has the right to terminate its agreement with UC/Vienna at any time or the agreement may be terminated by UC/Vienna due to an uncured material breach. We cannot guarantee that Caribou will maintain the UC/Vienna license for its full term. Should the license between Caribou and UC/Vienna be terminated for any reason, any compliant Caribou sublicenses as of the termination date will remain in effect and will be assigned to UC/Vienna in place of Caribou. Specifically, if we are in compliance with our obligations under our sublicense and Caribou and UC/Vienna terminate their agreement, UC/Vienna would replace Caribou as our licensor.

Since 2015, certain U.S. patents and patent applications within the UC/Vienna/Charpentier IP and a patent portfolio owned by the Broad Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the President and Fellows of Harvard College (collectively, the “Broad Institute patent family” or the “Broad”) have been involved in interferences at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”)’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board (the “PTAB”). The most recent interference began in 2019 (the “Broad Interference”) and its subject matter pertain to aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 systems and methods to edit genes in eukaryotic cells, including human cells. An interference is an adversarial proceeding conducted by the PTAB to determine who was the first to invent a particular invention claimed in U.S. patents and patent applications owned by different parties and in this situation, to determine which research group first invented the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology in eukaryotic cells and, therefore, is entitled to the patents covering the invention. As of December 31, 2024, the interference involved 14 allowable patent applications from the UC/Vienna/Charpentier eukaryotic patent family and 13 patents and one patent application from the Broad Institute patent family. On February 28, 2022, the PTAB issued a Decision of Priority and Judgment in the patent interference, finding that the involved patents and application in the Broad Institute patent family have priority over the patent applications in the UC/Vienna/Charpentier IP with respect to the subject matter of the interference. Both parties appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which held a hearing in May 2024.

In addition, the PTAB has instituted and completed the motions phase in two interferences involving the same UC/Vienna/Charpentier patent applications involved in the Broad Interference—one interference involving certain patent rights owned by ToolGen, Inc. (“ToolGen”) and another involving certain patent rights owned by Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC, a Merck KGaA subsidiary (“Sigma-Aldrich”). In both interferences, ToolGen and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively, purport that their patent rights cover the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene editing in eukaryotic cells. Both interferences are stayed pending a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in the Broad Interference. If either the Broad, ToolGen or Sigma-Aldrich were to succeed in their respective interference, the prevailing party or parties could seek to assert its issued patents against us based on our CRISPR/Cas9-based activities, including product commercialization. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense, would be a substantial diversion of management and other employee resources from our business and may impact our reputation. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties, delay launch or redesign our infringing products, which may not be feasible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. In that event, we may be unable to further develop and commercialize one or more of our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly.

Invention Management Agreement

On December 15, 2016, we entered into a Consent to Assignments, Licensing and Common Ownership and Invention Management Agreement (the “Invention Management Agreement”), with UC, Vienna, Dr. Charpentier, Caribou, CRISPR Therapeutics AG, ERS Genomics Ltd. and TRACR Hematology Ltd. Under the Invention Management Agreement, Dr. Charpentier retroactively consented to UC/Vienna’s CRISPR/Cas9 license to Caribou as well as Caribou’s sublicensing to Intellia

15

certain of its rights to the UC/Vienna/Charpentier CRISPR/Cas9 IP, subject to the restrictions of our license from Caribou. Under the agreement, the parties commit to maintain and coordinate the prosecution, defense and enforcement of the CRISPR/Cas9 foundational patent portfolio worldwide, and each of the co-owners of the IP grants cross-consents to all existing and future licenses and sublicenses based on the rights of another co-owner. The Invention Management Agreement also includes retroactive approval by certain parties of certain prior assignments of interests in patent rights to other parties, and provides for, among other things, (i) good faith cooperation among the parties regarding patent maintenance, defense and prosecution, (ii) cost-sharing arrangements, and (iii) notice of and coordination in the event of third party infringement of the subject patents. Unless earlier terminated by the parties, the Invention Management Agreement will continue in effect until the later of the last expiration date of the UC/Vienna/Charpentier patents underlying the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, or the date on which the last underlying patent application is abandoned.

Manufacturing

We have entered into certain manufacturing and supply arrangements with third party suppliers to support production of our product candidates and their components. We plan to continue to rely on qualified third party organizations and our own capabilities to produce or process bulk compounds, formulated compounds, viral vectors or engineered cells for IND-supporting activities and to supply materials for clinical trials. We expect that clinical and commercial quantities of any 
in vivo 
product or engineered cells that we may seek to develop will be manufactured in good manufacturing practice (“GMP”) compliant facilities and by processes that comply with FDA and other regulatory agency requirements.

Competition

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are extremely competitive in the race to develop new products. While we believe we have significant competitive advantages with our industry-leading expertise in genome editing, clinical development expertise and dominant IP position, we currently face and will continue to face competition for our development programs from companies that use genome editing or gene therapy development platforms and from companies focused on more traditional therapeutic modalities such as small molecules and antibodies. The competition is likely to come from multiple sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many of these competitors may have access to greater capital and resources than us. For any products that we may ultimately commercialize, not only will we compete with any existing therapies and those therapies currently in development, but we will also have to compete with new therapies that may become available in the future.

Specific to our nex-z program, we are aware of other companies that are currently commercializing or developing products and therapies used to treat ATTR amyloidosis, including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, BridgeBio Pharma Inc., Bayer AG, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Metagenomi Technologies, LLC, Novo Nordisk A/S, Pfizer, Inc. and YolTech Therapeutics.

Specific to our NTLA-2002 program, we are aware of other companies that are currently commercializing or developing products used to treat HAE, including ADARx Therapeutics, Inc., Astria Therapeutics Inc., BioCryst Pharmaceuticals Inc., CSL Limited, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pharming Group N.V., Pharvaris N.V. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.

Our platform and product foci are on the development of therapies using CRISPR-based technologies. Genome editing companies focused on CRISPR-based technologies include: Arbor Biotechnologies, Inc., Beam Therapeutics Inc., Caribou Biosciences, Inc., CRISPR Therapeutics AG, EdiGene, Inc., Editas Medicine, Inc., Emendo Biotherapeutics, Inc., Ensoma, Inc., Excision Biotherapeutics, Inc., Integra Therapeutics, S.L., Mammoth Biosciences, Inc., Metagenomi Technologies, LLC, Modalis Therapeutics Inc., nChroma Bio (formerly Chroma Medicine, Inc.), Prime Medicine, Inc., Scribe Therapeutics, Inc., Tessera Therapeutics, Inc., ToolGen, Inc., Tune Therapeutics, Inc., Verve Therapeutics, Inc. and YolTech Therapeutics.

There are also companies developing therapies using additional genome editing technologies, which include Allogene Therapeutics, Inc., bluebird bio, Inc., Cellectis S.A., Editas Medicine, Inc., Life Edit Therapeutics (an ElevateBio Company), Myeloid Therapeutics, Inc., Poseida Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired by Roche Holdings, Inc.), Precision Biosciences, Inc., Prime Medicine, Inc., Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc., Seamless Therapeutics, Inc., Stylus Medicine, Inc. and Tessera Therapeutics, Inc.

Metagenomi Technologies, LLC, Orna Therapeutics, Inc., Precision Biosciences, Inc., Prime Medicine, Inc., Tessera Therapeutics, Inc., Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Verve Therapeutics, Inc.

Our competitors will also include companies that are or will be developing other genome editing methods as well as small molecules, biologics, 
in vivo
 gene therapies, engineered

cell therapies and nucleic acid-based therapies for the same indications that we are targeting with our CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutics.

Government Regulation and Product Approval

As a biopharmaceutical company, we are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements. For example, we need approval from regulatory agencies for our clinical studies, development, manufacturing, distribution, exportation and importation, commercialization, marketing and reimbursement relating to our products and product candidates. Relevant regulatory authorities include, but are not limited to, the FDA, the EMA, the EC, EU Member State agencies, such as Germany’s Paul Ehrlich Institute (“PEI”), and other countries’ similar agencies, such as the MHRA, as well as health technology assessment bodies and public authorities responsible for market access and pricing, such as the U.K. National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (“NICE”).

We expect our future 
in vivo
 and 
ex vivo
 product candidates to be regulated as biologics. Biological products are subject to regulation under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic (“FD&C”) Act and the Public Health Service Act (“PHS Act”), and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving drug and biological products. As is the case for all investigational products, before clinical testing of biological products in the U.S. may begin, we must submit an IND application to the FDA, which reviews the clinical protocol and other information, and the IND application must become effective before clinical trials may begin. Prior to initiating clinical trials in foreign countries, clinical trial applications (“CTAs”) or other equivalent applications, similar to IND applications, must be approved.

Biologic products must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agencies before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.

Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) regulates biological products, including gene and cell therapies. CBER’s Office of Therapeutic Products (“OTP”) is responsible for oversight of gene therapy and related products, and the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee (“CTGTAC”) advises CBER on its reviews. Human gene therapy products are defined as all products that mediate their effects by transcription or translation of transferred genetic material or by specifically altering host (human) genetic sequences. Some examples of gene therapy products include nucleic acids, genetically modified microorganisms (e.g., viruses, bacteria, fungi), engineered site-specific nucleases used for human genome editing, and 
ex vivo
 genetically modified human cells. FDA has published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general and their preclinical assessment, potency or other quality testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy IND applications, and long-term adverse event monitoring of clinical trial subjects; all of which are intended to facilitate industry’s development of these products. More recently and as part of the implementation of the 21st Century Cures Act, FDA has issued a number of guidances pertaining to regenerative medicine advanced therapies, which include cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products and combination products using any such therapies or products. Additionally, gene therapies, including genetically modified cells, that lead to a durable modification of cells or tissues may meet the definition of a regenerative medicine therapy. A number of guidances have been revised to reflect the growing knowledge and incorporation of newer technology, including certain considerations for genome editing. A small, but growing number of gene therapy products, including gene editing therapies, have been approved by regulatory agencies.

U.S. Gene and Cell Therapy Products Development Process

The FDA approves biologics, including gene and cellular therapy products, through the BLA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. This process generally involves the following:

•
completion of extensive nonclinical, sometimes referred to as preclinical laboratory tests, and preclinical animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including good laboratory practice (“GLP”) and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals;

•
submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;

17

•
performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials, according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practice (“GCP”) and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product for its intended use;

•
submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, efficacy, and purity and potency, from nonclinical and 
in vitro
 testing and clinical trials;

•
satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practice (“cGTP”) requirements for the use of human cellular and tissue products;

•
positive results from potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;

•
review of the proposed product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;

•
payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA (unless a fee waiver applies, such as for product candidates designated as orphan drugs); and

•
FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.

Before testing any drug or biological product candidate, including gene and cellular therapy product candidates, in humans, the product candidate is evaluated through preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with applicable federal regulations and requirements, including GLP.

The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND application is submitted. The IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the clinical trial sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to, among other reasons, safety concerns or non-compliance with regulatory requirements. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not proceed without FDA authorization and then only under authorized terms. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND application will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that result in the suspension or termination of such trials.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the study sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and its amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.

In addition to the submission of an IND to the FDA before initiation of a clinical trial in the U.S., certain human clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules are subject to oversight of institutional biosafety committees, (“IBCs”), as set forth in the National Institutes for Health (“NIH”) Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (“NIH Guidelines”). Under the NIH Guidelines, recombinant and synthetic nucleic acids are defined as: (i) molecules that are constructed by joining nucleic acid molecules and that can replicate in a living cell (i.e., recombinant nucleic acids); (ii) nucleic acid molecules that are chemically or by other means synthesized or amplified, including those that are chemically or otherwise modified but can base pair with naturally occurring nucleic acid molecules (i.e., synthetic nucleic acids); or (iii) molecules that result from the replication of those described in (i) or (ii). Specifically, under the NIH Guidelines,

18

supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them.

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

•
Phase 1. The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.

•
Phase 2. The product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.

•
Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency (for BLA products), and safety in an expanded patient population at dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product, including as compared to current standard treatments, and provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling.

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional evidence about the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA typically advises that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for up to a 15-year period after administration, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire.

During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events that are associated with the use of the product candidate, any findings from other trials, tests in laboratory animals or 
in vitro
 testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.

Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including biologics such as gene and cellular therapy products, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information to NIH. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made publicly available as part of the registration at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Sponsors also are obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved, up to a maximum of two years.

19

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the product candidate, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP, and in certain cases, cGTP, requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final product to support a BLA. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

U.S. Review and Approval Processes

FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal trials, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”), a BLA or supplement to a BLA, for a product candidate with certain novel characteristics must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 (“FDASIA”) requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a biological product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (“PSP”) within sixty days after an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA, unless exempt due to orphan drug designation. The initial PSP must include, among other things, an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including, to the extent practicable, study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information, along with any other information specified in FDA regulations. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from nonclinical studies, early phase clinical trials, or other clinical development programs. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan drug designation has been granted. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.

Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission, including for failure to pay required fees, and may request additional information. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective (or, in the case of biologics, to ensure safety, purity and potency), and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP, and in certain cases, cGTP, requirements to ensure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the FDA review and approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product candidate. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the application without a REMS, if required.

Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and, if applicable, cGTP requirements are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted

20

in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, cGTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.

Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the application identified by the FDA. Addressing the deficiencies identified may require significant development work, such as product reformulation or additional clinical trials. The complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the application, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, challenge the determination set forth in the letter by requesting a hearing or withdraw the application.

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases, dosages or patient subgroups or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, precautions or adverse events be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.

One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA VII (Fiscal Years 2023-2027) is to review 90% of BLAs in 10 months from the 60-day filing date, and 90% of priority BLAs in six months from the 60-day filing date, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs, and its review goals are subject to change with PDUFA reauthorization. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission, also known as a Major Amendment, within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.

Orphan Drug Designation

The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to biological products, including cellular and gene therapy products, intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submission of BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.

In the U.S., orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same orphan indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan designated product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity, which may permit off-label use for the orphan indication. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA for the same orphan indication or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.

Expedited Development and Review Programs

In the U.S. and the EU, as well as in other countries, there are a number of programs to expedite development, review and approval of products for serious or life-threatening disease or condition that address an unmet medical need in the relevant regulatory jurisdiction. In the U.S., these FDA programs include Fast Track Designation, priority review, accelerated approval, Breakthrough Therapy designation and RMAT. Similar programs in the EU include accelerated assessment, conditional approval and the PRIME program.

The FDA’s Fast Track program intends to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new biologic, including gene and cellular therapy products, may request that the FDA designate the product as a Fast Track product at any time during the product’s clinical development, but ideally not later than the pre-BLA meeting. The FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application for a Fast Track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.

In the U.S., any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness of the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of that condition. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product subject to accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled, post-marketing confirmatory clinical trials to confirm the effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (“FDORA”), the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that post-approval confirmatory trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after accelerated approval is granted. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies with due diligence, or to confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market and, under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw approval of a product granted accelerated approval. In addition, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, pre-approval of promotional materials as a condition for accelerated approval, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.

FDA's Breakthrough Therapy designation program is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biological product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the features of Fast Track designation, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, but these can also be granted to the same product candidate if the relevant criteria are met. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. All requests for Breakthrough Therapy designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt, and FDA will either grant or deny the request.

Orphan designation, Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.

Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapies (“RMAT”) Designation

As part of the 21
st
 Century Cures Act, the FD&C Act was amended to facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of regenerative advanced therapies, which include cell and gene therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. Gene therapies,

22

including genetically modified cells, that lead to a durable modification of cells or tissues may meet the definition of a regenerative medicine therapy. This program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of regenerative medicine therapies, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and qualify for RMAT designation. A drug sponsor may request that FDA designate a drug as a RMAT concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A BLA for a regenerative medicine therapy that has received RMAT designation may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through use of surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of RMAT designation also include early interactions with FDA and, for those granted accelerated approval, post-approval requirements may be fulfilled through the submission of clinical evidence from clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real-world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval. Like the FDA’s other expedited development programs, RMAT designation does not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.

Post-Approval Requirements

Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations and, as applicable, their counterparts in other jurisdictions, requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products, including gene and cellular therapy products, continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of certain components of products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control, quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products, including gene and cellular therapy products.

We also would have to comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet and social media platforms. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the labeling or marketing of a product, imposition of a REMS or post-market study requirement or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.

Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products, including gene and cellular therapy products, in the U.S. are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain other federal and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain other federal and state agencies for compliance with cGMP, and in certain cases, cGTP, requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market, as well as potential civil and criminal liability. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

Biosimilars and Exclusivity

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act” or “ACA”), signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (“BPCIA”), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product in the U.S. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. Starting in 2015, the FDA commenced licensing biosimilars under the BPCIA, and there are currently numerous biosimilars approved in the U.S. and Europe. The FDA has issued a number of draft and final guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars and interchangeable biological products.

The BPCIA also contains various provisions regarding exclusivity for reference and interchangeable products and procedures for sharing and litigating patents covering the reference product. A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product is eligible for a period of exclusivity against other biologics submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway during which time the FDA may not determine that another product is interchangeable with the same reference product for any condition of use. The FDA may approve multiple “first” interchangeable products so long as they are all approved on the same first day of marketing. This exclusivity period, which may be shared amongst multiple first interchangeable products, lasts for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologic’s patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period. The BPCIA, however, is complex and only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, proposed legislation has sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.

A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the U.S. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods for all formulations, dosage forms, and indications of the biologic. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study, provided that at the time pediatric exclusivity is granted there is not less than nine months of term remaining.

Additional Regulation

In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, all affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.

Other Healthcare and Privacy Laws

In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of biological products, other U.S. federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, which include, but are not limited to, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, data privacy and security, and physician payment transparency laws. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

•
the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or certain rebates), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order, arrangement for or recommendation of the purchase, lease, order, arrangement for any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have 

24

actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”). Violators are subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties, as well as imprisonment and exclusion from government healthcare programs;

•
federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including, without limitation, the federal FCA, and civil monetary penalty laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from the federal government, including Medicare, Medicaid and other government payors, that are false or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, promoting a product off-label. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring civil whistleblower or 
qui tam
 actions against individuals (including biopharmaceutical manufacturers and sellers) on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. These laws impose criminal and civil penalties on violators;

•
the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), and its implementing regulations, which impose criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. HIPAA violations can lead to civil and criminal liability;

•
HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, which impose, among other things, requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state and non-U.S. laws govern the privacy and security of health and other personal information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating efforts to comply with their respective provisions;

•
the U.S. federal physician payment transparency requirements, sometimes referred to as the “Physician Payments Sunshine Act,” created under the ACA, and their implementing regulations, which require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually, to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other licensed healthcare practitioners, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians, other healthcare providers, and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately, and completely reported in an annual submission;

•
federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;

•
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other laws which prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business;

25

•
the FD&C Act, which prohibits, among other things, the commercialization of adulterated or misbranded drugs and medical devices and the PHS Act, which prohibits, among other things, the commercialization of biological products unless a biologics license is in effect; and

•
analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers, and may be broader in scope than their federal equivalents; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Because of the breadth of these laws and the limited statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.

In the EU, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) regulates the collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer or other processing of personal data, including personal health data. The GDPR covers any business, regardless of its location, that provides goods or services to residents in the EU and, thus, could incorporate our activities in EU Member States. The GDPR imposes strict requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including special protections for “sensitive information,” which includes health and genetic information of individuals residing in the EU, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, ensuring certain accountability measures are in place and taking certain measures when engaging third party processors. The GDPR grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal data, allows them to request deletion of personal data in certain circumstances, and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. Further, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to regions that have not been deemed to offer “adequate” privacy protections. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States, which may deviate slightly from the GDPR, may result in warning letters, mandatory audits and financial penalties, including fines of up to 4% of annual global revenues, or €20,000,000, whichever is greater. As a result of the GDPR, we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules, including as implemented by individual countries.

Further to the U.K.’s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the U.K. incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain U.K. specific amendments) into U.K. law, referred to as the U.K. GDPR. The U.K. GDPR and the U.K. Data Protection Act 2018 set out the U.K.’s data protection regime, which is independent from but currently still aligned to the EU’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the U.K. GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. Although the U.K. is regarded as a third country under the EU’s GDPR, the U.K. is recognized as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the U.K. remain unrestricted. Likewise, the U.K. government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the U.K. to the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which consists of the EU Member States, plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland remain free flowing.

In California, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires covered businesses to comply with specific privacy and security obligations, such as providing disclosures to consumers in California about such companies’ data collection, use and sharing practices, and providing consumers the ability to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information, and providing consumers with a private right of action for certain data breaches. The law also created a new state regulatory agency that is vested with the authority to implement and enforce the CCPA.

Several other U.S. states have either passed or enacted privacy legislation similar to the CCPA, which incorporate similar concepts of the CCPA, but contain key differences in the scope, application, and enforcement which may complicate compliance efforts. Further, in addition to comprehensive laws at the state level, some states have been proposing or passing laws that target particular aspects of privacy. For example, the state of Washington has enacted a wide-ranging law that protects the privacy of medical and health-related information that is not covered by HIPAA and a small number of states have passed laws specifically focused on biometric information.

26

At the federal level, regulators and legislators in the U.S. are increasingly scrutinizing and restricting certain personal data transfers and transactions involving foreign countries. For example, the Biden Administration’s executive order Preventing Access to Americans’ Bulk Sensitive Personal Data and United States Government-Related Data by Countries of Concern, as implemented by Department of Justice regulations issued in December 2024, prohibits data brokerage transactions involving certain sensitive personal data categories, including health data, genetic data, and biospecimens, to countries of concern, including China. The regulations also restrict certain investment agreements, employment agreements and vendor agreements involving such data and countries of concern, absent specified cybersecurity controls. Actual or alleged violations of these regulations may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions and may result in exclusion from participation in federal and state programs.

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, individual imprisonment, and additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with this law, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.

To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.

Regulation in the European Union

Clinical Trial Approval

In April 2014, the EU adopted the Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, which replaced the previous Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC on 31 January 2022. The Clinical Trials Regulation is directly applicable in all EU Member States meaning no national implementing legislation in each EU Member State is required. The Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the Regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point through the Clinical Trials Information System (“CTIS”); a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned) of a draft report prepared by a reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of CTAs. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure continues to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State, however, overall related timelines are defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. The Clinical Trials Regulation also provides for simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors.

Marketing Authorization

In the EU, medicinal products, including advanced therapy medicinal products (“ATMPs”), are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by regulatory authorities at both the EU and national levels. ATMPs comprise gene therapy products, somatic cell therapy products and tissue engineered products. We anticipate that our gene therapy development products would be regulated as ATMPs in the EU.

To obtain regulatory approval of our medicinal products in the EU, we must submit a marketing authorization application (“MAA”) to the EMA.

The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the EC that is valid throughout the EU, and in the additional member states of the EEA (Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein). Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, ATMPs, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including products for the treatment of cancer, HIV or AIDS, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. For those products for which the use of the centralized procedure is not mandatory, applicants may elect to use the centralized procedure where either the product contains a new active substance indicated for the treatment of diseases other than those listed above, or where the applicant can show that the product

27

constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which the centralized procedure is in the interest of patients at an EU level.

Specifically, the grant of marketing authorization in the EU for ATMPs is governed by Regulation (EC) No. 1394/2007 on ATMPs, read in combination with Directive 2001/83/EC on medicinal products. Regulation (EC) No. 1394/2007 lays down specific rules concerning the authorization, supervision, and pharmacovigilance of gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products, and tissue engineered products. Manufacturers of ATMPs must demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of their products to the Committee for Advanced Therapies (“CAT”), at the EMA, which conducts a scientific assessment of the MAA and provides an opinion regarding the MAA for an ATMP.

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”), established at the EMA, is responsible for issuing a final opinion on whether an ATMP meets the required quality, safety and efficacy requirements, and whether the product has a positive benefit/risk profile. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days from receipt of a valid MAA, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Clock stops may extend the timeframe of evaluation of an MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, it provides the opinion, together with supporting documentation, to the EC, who make the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the time frame of 210 days for assessment will be reduced to 150 days (excluding clock stops), but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.

Data and Market Exclusivity

The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the EU, upon receiving marketing authorization, innovative medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. Data exclusivity prevents applicants for authorization of generics or biosimilars of these innovative products from referencing the innovator’s pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the EU, during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may therefore not qualify for data exclusivity. Even if a product is considered to be an innovative medicinal product so that the innovator gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, pre-clinical tests and clinical trials.

Orphan Designation and Exclusivity

Products with an orphan designation in the EU will, upon the grant of a marketing authorization for such orphan product, receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time no “similar medicinal product” for the same indication may be placed on the market. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. An orphan product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU where an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan (“PIP”) for pediatric studies has been complied with. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate (“SPC”) can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for a product with an orphan designation.

The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the EU are similar in principle to those in the U.S. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as an orphan medicinal product if it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made; or (b) it is unlikely that the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as

28

defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the MAA if the orphan drug designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the MAA is submitted. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.

The ten-year market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication as an authorized orphan product at any time if:

•
the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar to an authorized orphan product, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to such authorized product;

•
the marketing authorization holder for the authorized orphan product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or

•
the marketing authorization holder for the authorized orphan product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.

Pediatric development

In the EU, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a PIP with the EMA and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a waiver applies, (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults). This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The MAA for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been granted, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date. Products that are granted a marketing authorization on the basis of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six month extension of the protection under a SPC provided an application for such extension is made at the same time as filing the SPC application for the product, or at any point up to two years before the SPC expires, even where the trial results are negative. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.

Post-approval controls

The holder of a marketing authorization must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports (“PSURs”).

All new MAAs must include a risk management plan (“RMP”), describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions.

The manufacturing of authorized medicinal products, for which a separate manufacturer’s license is mandatory, must also be conducted in strict compliance with the applicable EU laws, regulations and guidance, including Directive 2001/83/EC, Directive 2017/1572, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and the European Commission Guidelines for Good Manufacturing Practice. These requirements include compliance with EU cGMP standards when manufacturing medicinal products and active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients outside of the EU with the intention to import the active pharmaceutical ingredients into the EU.

All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved Summary of Product Characteristics and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each EU Member State and can differ from one country to another.

29

All of the aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA, which consists of the EU Member States, plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.

The EC introduced legislative proposals in April 2023 that, if implemented, will replace the current regulatory framework in the EU for all medicines (including those for rare diseases and for children). The EC has provided the legislative proposals to the European Parliament and the European Council for their review and approval, and, in April 2024, the European Parliament proposed amendments to the legislative proposals. Once the EC’s legislative proposals are approved (with or without amendment), they will be adopted into EU law.

For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.

If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

Other Government Regulation

In addition to the healthcare laws and regulations in the U.S. and EU discussed above, we may be subject to a variety of regulations in these and other jurisdictions governing, among other things, animal research, clinical studies, manufacture, marketing approval, and any commercial sales and distribution of biological products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. These regulations may continue to change, and we may be required to change our operations and business conduct in response to these changes.

Coverage and Reimbursement

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any biological product for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third party payors. Third party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, health maintenance organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. Coverage and reimbursement by a third party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third party payor’s determination that use of a product is:

•
a covered benefit under its health plan;

•
safe, effective and medically necessary;

•
appropriate for the specific patient;

•
cost-effective; and

•
neither experimental nor investigational.

In the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for biological products, including gene and cellular therapy products, exists among third party payors. As a result, obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for such a product from a government or other third party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data regarding the products’ clinical benefits and risks on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. Even if we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate for us to achieve or sustain profitability or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, third party payors may not cover, or provide adequate reimbursement for, long-term follow-up evaluations required following the use of our gene editing products. Patients are unlikely to use, and health care providers may not prescribe, our product candidates unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the product’s cost to the patient. Because our product candidates may have a higher cost of goods than conventional therapies, and may require long-term follow up evaluations, the risk that coverage and reimbursement rates may be inadequate for us to achieve profitability may be greater. Moreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third party payors in the U.S. and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to

30

limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for biological products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. In addition, we expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates upon their approval due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, cost containment initiatives and additional legislative changes. For these reasons, there is significant uncertainty related to coverage and reimbursement of our future products. It is difficult to predict at this time what third party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates.

Third‑party and government payors consistently seek to reduce reimbursements for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs is a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost‑containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost‑containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third‑party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third‑party payor to not cover our products could reduce physician usage of the products and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.

Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non‑governmental payors.

It is likely that our product candidates, once approved, will have to be administered by a health care provider. Under currently applicable U.S. law, certain products not usually self-administered (including injectable drugs) may be eligible for coverage under Medicare Part B. As a condition of receiving Medicare Part B reimbursement, the manufacturer of the therapy is required to participate in other government healthcare programs, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the 340B Drug Pricing Program, both of which require the manufacturer to provide rebated pricing under certain conditions. For example, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to have a national rebate agreement with the federal government as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to program eligible entities, which generally are federally funded clinics and hospitals that serve large numbers of low-income and uninsured patients.

In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. An EU Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.

Healthcare Reform

In the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare.

For example, in 2010, the ACA was enacted in the U.S. The ACA includes measures that have significantly changed, and are expected to continue to significantly change, the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are that the ACA:

•
subjects biological products to potential competition by biosimilars;

•
increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program;

•
created a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to provide a 70% point‑of‑sale discount off the negotiated price of applicable branded drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs being covered under Medicare Part D;

31

•
extended a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;

•
expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program;

•
imposed an annual, nondeductible fee and tax on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs; and

•
established mechanisms to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.

Other legislative changes relevant to the healthcare system have been adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted.

•
In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress that include aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which remain in effect through 2031. 

•
In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers, cancer centers and other treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 

•
On May 30, 2018, the Right to Try Act was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. 

•
In May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option to use step therapy, a type of prior authorization, for Part B drugs. This final rule codified CMS’s policy change that was effective January 1, 2019.

•
On March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. These laws and regulations may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used.

Additionally, there have been a number of proposed regulatory actions and legislative recommendations aimed at lowering prescription drug prices. Specifically, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs.

•
In August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) was signed into law. The IRA includes several provisions that will impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that create a $2,000 out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries, impose new manufacturer financial liability on all drugs in Medicare Part D, allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D pricing for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition, require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for drug prices that increase faster than inflation, and delay the rebate rule that would require pass through of pharmacy benefit manager rebates to beneficiaries. Further, under the IRA, orphan drugs are exempted from the Medicare drug price negotiation program, but only if they have one orphan designation and for which the only approved indication is for that disease or condition. If a product receives multiple orphan designations or has multiple approved indications, it may not qualify for the orphan drug exemption. The implementation of the IRA is currently subject to ongoing litigation challenging the constitutionality of the IRA’s Medicare drug price negotiation program. The effect of the IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known.

•
At a federal level, President Trump reversed some of President Biden’s executive orders including rescinding Executive Order 14087 entitled “Lowering Prescription Drug Costs for Americans.” President Trump may issue new 

32

executive orders designed to impact drug pricing, and/or rescind or modify the previous administration’s efforts to address drug costs. A number of these and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective. Congress and the Trump administration have indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs.

We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.

Risks Related to Our Business

Risks Related to Preclinical and Clinical Development

CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology has only recently been clinically validated for human therapeutic use.

We are focused on developing novel therapeutics utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology, including 
in vivo 
therapies and 
ex vivo
 engineered cell therapies. Although there have been significant advances in recent years in the fields of gene therapy and genome editing, 
in vivo
 CRISPR-based genome editing technologies are relatively new and their therapeutic utility is largely unproven. Our approach to developing therapies centers on using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to alter, introduce or remove genetic information 
in vivo 
to treat various disorders, or to engineer human cells 
ex vivo
 to create therapeutic cells that can be introduced into the human body to address the underlying disease.

The approaches we are taking to discover and develop novel therapeutics using CRISPR/Cas9 systems are unproven and may never lead to marketable products.

Successful development of products by us will require solving a number of issues, including developing or obtaining technologies to safely deliver a therapeutic agent into target cells within the human body or engineer human cells while outside of the body such that the modified cells can have a therapeutic effect when delivered to the patient, optimizing the efficacy and specificity of such products, and demonstrating the therapeutic selectivity, efficacy, potency, purity and safety of such products. There can be no assurance we will be successful in solving any or all of these issues. With regards to CRISPR/Cas9-based therapies specifically, we are in clinical-stage development for nex-z and NTLA-2002 and advancing towards clinical testing for our other 
in vivo
 and 
ex vivo 
product candidates. Although one CRISPR/Cas9-edited 
ex vivo
 therapy has been approved in the United States (“U.S.”) and European Union (“EU”), no genome editing 
in vivo 
therapy has been approved in the U.S., EU countries or other key jurisdictions, and the potential to successfully obtain approval for any of our CRISPR/Cas9 product candidates remains uncertain.

If we are unable to develop viable product candidates, achieve regulatory approval for any such product candidate or market and sell any resulting product, we may never achieve profitability.

Our future success also is highly dependent on the successful development of CRISPR-based genome editing technologies, cellular delivery methods and therapeutic applications for the indications on which we have focused our ongoing research and development efforts. We may decide to alter or abandon these programs as new data become available and we gain experience in developing CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutics. We cannot be sure that our CRISPR/Cas9 efforts and technologies will yield satisfactory products that are safe and effective, sufficiently pure or potent, manufacturable, scalable or profitable in our selected

34

indications or any other indication we pursue. We cannot guarantee that progress or success in developing any particular CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutic product will translate to other CRISPR/Cas9-based products.

Public perception and related media coverage of potential therapy-related efficacy or safety issues, including adoption of new therapeutics or novel approaches to treatment, as well as ethical concerns related specifically to genome editing and CRISPR-based therapies, may adversely influence the willingness of subjects to participate in clinical trials, or if any therapeutic is approved, of physicians and patients to accept these novel and personalized treatments. Physicians, healthcare providers and third party payors often are slow to adopt new products, technologies and treatment practices, particularly those that may also require additional upfront costs and training. Physicians may not be willing to undergo training to adopt these novel therapies, may decide the particular therapy is too complex or potentially risky to adopt without appropriate training, and may choose not to administer the therapy. Further, due to health conditions, genetic profile or other reasons, certain patients may not be candidates for the therapies. In addition, responses by federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments to negative public perception, ethical concerns or financial considerations may result in new legislation, regulations, or medical standards that could limit our ability to develop or commercialize any product candidates, obtain or maintain regulatory approval or otherwise achieve profitability. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. Based on these and other factors, healthcare providers and payors may decide that the benefits of these new therapies do not or will not outweigh their costs, which would affect our ability to market and sell our product candidates and achieve profitability.

Clinical development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome.

All of our programs are still in the discovery, preclinical or clinical stage. Our current and future product candidates will require preclinical and clinical activities and studies, regulatory review and approval in each jurisdiction in which we intend to market the products, substantial investment, establishing manufacturing capabilities, access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity and significant marketing efforts before we can generate any revenue from product sales. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of a product candidate, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, potency and efficacy of the product in humans. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our programs will prove effective and safe in humans or will receive regulatory approval. Preclinical and clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. We may be unable to establish clinical endpoints that regulatory authorities consider clinically meaningful, and a clinical trial can fail at any stage. The outcome of preclinical testing and clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain approval of their products.

We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of any product candidates.

Successful completion of clinical trials is a prerequisite to submitting a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), and similar applications to comparable foreign regulatory authorities, for each product candidate and, consequently, the ultimate approval and commercial marketing of any product candidates. We do not know whether any of our clinical trials will begin or be completed on schedule, if at all. In addition, the regulatory requirements for later phase clinical trials, such as pivotal trials, are generally more stringent than earlier phase clinical trials, such as Phase 1 trials. We may not meet the requirements of regulatory authorities, such as the FDA, for initiating later phase clinical trials for our product candidates, which could delay the development of our product candidates, including the submission of a BLA or comparable marketing application.

35

Because these are new therapeutic approaches, discovering, developing, manufacturing and commercializing our product candidates may subject us to a number of challenges or delays in completing our preclinical studies and initiating or completing clinical trials. We also may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, any current or future clinical trials that we conduct, which could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:

•
challenges in obtaining regulatory authorization or approval to conduct clinical trials in the U.S. from the FDA through an investigational new drug (“IND”) application or from other regulatory agencies outside the U.S., such as the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) or the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), through corresponding applications, such as a clinical trial application, a clinical trial notification or a clinical trial exemption, because these agencies have very limited or no experience with the clinical development of CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutics, particularly 
in vivo 
therapeutics, which may require additional significant testing or data compared to more traditional therapies or otherwise delay the development of our product candidates;

•
successfully developing processes for the safe administration of these product candidates, including long-term follow-up for patients who receive treatment with any of our product candidates; 

•
regulators, institutional review boards (“IRBs”) or ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial; 

•
inability to reach, or delays in reaching, agreement on acceptable terms with trial sites and contract research organizations (“CROs”); 

•
clinical trials of any product candidates may fail to show safety or efficacy, or could produce negative or inconclusive results, which could result in having to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials or terminating the product development programs; 

•
we may not be able to initiate or complete clinical trials of a product candidate if the required number of subjects is larger than we anticipated, the number of subjects willing to enroll is smaller than required, the pace of enrollment is slower than anticipated, or subjects drop out or fail to return for post-treatment follow-up at a higher rate than we anticipated;

•
we may need to educate medical personnel, including clinical investigators, and patients regarding the potential benefits and side effect profile of each of our product candidates;

•
regulatory agencies may require us to amend our INDs or equivalent regulatory filings, modify the design of our clinical trials or perform more extensive or lengthier preclinical or clinical testing compared to existing therapeutic modalities, any of which may delay the initiation or progression of any of our clinical trials;

•
animal models may not exist, or available animal models may be inadequate, for some of the human diseases we choose to pursue in our programs, or the preclinical studies we perform as part of our programs;

•
our third party contractors, clinical trial sites or investigators may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their performance obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all, or may deviate from the clinical trial protocol or drop out of the trial, which may require that we add new clinical trial sites or investigators; 

•
we may elect to, or regulators, IRBs or ethics committees may require that we or our investigators, suspend or terminate clinical research or trials for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; 

•
the cost of preclinical studies and clinical trials of any product candidates may be greater than we anticipate; 

•
the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate, or not available in a reasonable timeframe, and any transfer of manufacturing activities may require unforeseen manufacturing or formulation changes; 

•
we may face challenges in sourcing preclinical, clinical and, if approved, commercial supplies for the materials used to manufacture and process our product candidates, which may include importing or exporting materials between different jurisdictions;

36

•
our product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, such as effects or characteristics resulting from their biodistribution or mechanism of action, causing us or our investigators, regulators, IRBs or ethics committees to suspend or terminate the trials, or reports may arise from preclinical or clinical testing of other gene therapies or genome editing-based therapies that raise safety or efficacy concerns about our product candidates; 

•
the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require us to submit additional data, such as long-term toxicology studies, or impose other requirements, including submitting preclinical data earlier in clinical development compared to existing therapeutic modalities or requiring amendments to our regulatory filings, before permitting us to initiate or rely on a clinical trial;

•
we may face challenges in establishing sales and marketing capabilities in anticipation of, and after obtaining, any regulatory approval to gain market authorization; 

•
the FDA or other regulatory authorities may revise the requirements for authorizing our clinical trials or approving our product candidates, or their interpretation of the authorization or approval requirements may not be what we anticipate or require us to adopt Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) as a condition of approval; and 

•
we may not ultimately obtain regulatory approval for a BLA, or corresponding applications outside the U.S., such as a marketing authorization application in the U.K. and other similar regulatory authorities, which may have very limited or no experience with the clinical development of CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutics, particularly 
in vivo 
therapeutics. 

We could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, the relevant ethics committee or the FDA or other relevant regulatory authorities, or if the Data Monitoring Committee (“DMC”) for such trial recommends such suspension or termination. Such authorities may impose or recommend such a suspension or termination due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our study protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, manufacturing or quality control issues, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product or treatment, failure to establish or achieve clinically meaningful trial endpoints, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. Many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also lead to a delay in submitting a BLA or comparable marketing application or ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. Further, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may disagree with our clinical trial design and our interpretation of data from clinical trials or may change the requirements for approval even after they have reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials.

Additionally, because our 
in vivo 
technology potentially involves genome editing across multiple cell and tissue types, we are subject to many of the challenges and risks that other genome editing therapeutics and gene therapies face, including:

•
regulatory guidance for gene and genome editing therapy products has changed and may continue to change in the future, including, e.g., the finalized guidance document titled “Human Gene Therapy Products Incorporating Human Genome Editing” that the FDA issued in January 2024 and the draft guidance document titled “Frequently Asked Questions — Developing Potential Cellular and Gene Therapy Products” published in November 2024;

•
to date, only a limited number of products that involve 
in vivo 
gene transfer have been approved globally;

•
improper modulation of a gene sequence, including unintended editing events, insertion of a sequence into certain locations in a patient’s chromosome or other effects related to the biodistribution of our product candidates, could lead to cancer, other aberrantly functioning cells or other diseases, including death;

•
transient expression of the Cas9 protein or other genome editing components of our product candidates could lead to patients having an immunological reaction towards those modified cells, which could be severe or life-threatening;

•
corrective expression of a missing protein in patients’ cells could result in the protein being recognized as foreign, and lead to a sustained immunological reaction against the expressed protein or expressing cells, which could be severe or life-threatening; and

•
regulatory agencies may require extended follow-up observation periods of patients who receive treatment using genome editing products including, for example, the FDA’s recommended 15-year follow-up observation period for these patients, and we will need to adopt such observation periods for our product candidates if required by the relevant regulatory agency, which could vary by country or region.

37

Further, because our 
ex vivo 
product candidates involve editing human cells and then delivering modified cells to patients, we are subject to many of the challenges and risks that engineered cell therapies face. For example, patients treated with engineered cell-based gene therapies may experience an allogeneic response leading to allograft rejection and potential local and systemic toxicities, which could be severe or life-threatening.

To date, most human clinical trials utilizing either 
in vivo
 or 
ex vivo 
CRISPR-based therapeutics are still at a clinical stage, with only one 
ex vivo 
CRISPR-based therapeutic product approved in the U.S. and EU. We have ongoing clinical trials in various countries for nex-z for transthyretin (“ATTR”) amyloidosis and NTLA-2002 for hereditary angioedema (“HAE”). There is no certainty that the FDA or other similar agencies will continue to apply to all our CRISPR/Cas9 product candidates the same regulatory pathway and requirements it is applying to other 
in vivo 
therapies or 
ex vivo 
engineered therapeutics.

In addition, if any product candidates encounter safety or efficacy problems, development delays, regulatory issues or other problems, our development plans and business could be significantly harmed. For the reasons described above, among others, regulatory bodies, particularly the FDA, have requested, and may request in the future, additional preclinical studies for genome editing products, such as additional studies related to toxicology, biodistribution or reproductive health, and/or preclinical studies earlier in clinical development compared to other therapeutic modalities. Although the FDA cleared the INDs that we have submitted, it is possible that the FDA may impose requirements that result in a delay of any of our programs, including our submission of a BLA or comparable marketing application, or their regulatory approval. If we are unable to complete the required studies satisfactorily, the FDA or other regulatory bodies could require that we exclude certain patient populations from clinical studies, place our clinical studies on hold, or require us to cease further clinical studies or deny approval of such product candidates. Further, competitors that are developing 
in vivo
 or 
ex vivo
 products with similar technology may experience problems with their product candidates or programs that could in turn cause us to identify problems with our product candidates and programs or cause the FDA or other regulatory bodies to impose additional requirements, that could cause us to delay or pause development of our product candidates. Any of these occurrences may harm our ability to identify and develop product candidates, and may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects significantly.

We may experience manufacturing delays or other issues that prevent us from executing the clinical trials for nex-z and NTLA-2002 or our other product candidates on the timeline we expect. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that the FDA, MHRA, the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority, or other regulatory authorities will not change their requirements in the future or that they will approve amendments to our INDs or equivalent regulatory filings, including for nex-z and NTLA-2002, or our other product candidates, on the timeline we expect.

Results, including data from our preclinical and clinical studies, are not necessarily predictive of our other ongoing and future preclinical and clinical studies, and they do not guarantee or indicate the likelihood of approval of any potential product candidate by the FDA or any other regulatory agency. If we cannot replicate positive results from any of our preclinical or clinical activities and studies, we may be unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize any potential product candidate.

From time to time, we may disclose interim data from our clinical trials, such as the interim results of our ongoing Phase 1 study of nex-z or Phase 1/2 study of NTLA-2002. Interim data from clinical trials that have not been completed are subject to the risk that the later results may be materially different as patient enrollment continues. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Consequently, interim data should be viewed with caution until we make the final data and analysis available.

In addition, there is a high failure rate, as well as potential substantial and unanticipated delays, for product candidates progressing through preclinical and clinical studies. Even if we are able to successfully complete our ongoing and future preclinical and clinical activities and studies for any potential product candidate, we may not be able to replicate, or may have to engage in significant efforts and resource and time investments to replicate, any positive results from these or any other studies in any of our future preclinical and clinical trials, and they do not guarantee approval of any potential product candidate by the FDA or any other necessary regulatory authorities in a timely manner or at all. For more information regarding these risks, see also the remainder of this risk factor section.

38

Negative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of CRISPR/Cas9 use, genome editing or gene therapy may damage public perception of the safety of our product candidates and adversely affect our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for such product candidates.

Gene therapy in general, and genome editing in particular, remain novel technologies, with only a limited number of gene therapy products, and only one 
ex vivo
 genome editing product, approved to date in the U.S. and EU. Public perception may be influenced by claims that gene therapy or genome editing, including the use of CRISPR/Cas9, is unsafe or unethical, or carries an undue risk of side effects, such as improper modification of a gene sequence in a patient’s chromosome that could lead to disease such as cancer, and gene therapy or genome editing may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. In particular, our success will depend upon physicians who specialize in the treatment of diseases targeted by our product candidates prescribing our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments with which they are more familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available. In addition, responses by the U.S., state or foreign governments to negative public perception or ethical concerns may result in new legislation or regulations that could limit our ability to develop or commercialize any product candidates, obtain or maintain regulatory approval or otherwise achieve profitability. More restrictive statutory regimes, government regulations or negative public opinion could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects, and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our product candidates or demand for any products we may develop. For example, certain gene therapy trials led to several well-publicized adverse events, including cases of leukemia and death. Serious adverse events, such as these, in our clinical trials, or other clinical trials involving gene therapy or genome editing products or our competitors’ products, even if not ultimately attributable to the relevant product candidates, and the resulting publicity could result in increased government regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that are approved and a decrease in demand for any such product candidate. In addition, the use of genome editing technology by third parties in areas that are not being pursued by us, such as for targeting and editing of embryonic cells, could adversely impact public and governmental perceptions regarding the ethics and risks of CRISPR/Cas9 technology and lead to social or legal changes that could limit our ability to apply the technology to develop human therapies addressing disease. For example, reports of the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in China and Russia to edit embryos 
in utero 
have generated, and may continue to generate, negative public perception about the use of the technology in humans. Negative public and governmental perception of the technology, or additional governmental regulation of our technologies, could also adversely affect our stock price or our ability to enter into revenue generating collaborations or obtain additional funding from the public markets.

Risks Related to the Industry

Inconclusive results, lack of efficacy, adverse events or additional safety concerns in clinical trials that we or others conduct may impede the regulatory approval process or overall market acceptance of our product candidates.

Therapeutic applications of genome editing technologies, and CRISPR/Cas9 in particular, for both 
in vivo
 products and 
ex vivo 
products, are uncertain and must undergo rigorous clinical trials and regulatory review before receiving marketing authorization. If the results of our clinical studies or those of any other third parties, including with respect to genome editing technology or engineered cell therapies, are inconclusive or fail to show efficacy or if such clinical trials give rise to safety concerns or adverse events, we may:

•
be prevented from, or delayed in, obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates; 

•
obtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired; 

•
obtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings; 

•
be subject to the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications, or other types of regulatory restrictions or scrutiny; 

•
be subject to changes in the way the product is administered; 

•
be required to perform additional clinical studies to support approval or be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements; 

•
have regulatory authorities modify or withdraw their legal requirements or written guidance, if any, regarding the applicable regulatory approval pathway or any approval of the product in question, or impose restrictions on its distribution in the form of a modified REMS or similar strategy; 

•
be sued; or 

•
experience damage to our reputation.

39

Additionally, our product candidates could potentially cause other adverse events that have not yet been predicted and the potentially permanent nature of genome editing effects, including CRISPR/Cas9’s effects, on genes or novel cell therapies in the organs of the human body may make these adverse events irreversible. The inclusion of critically ill patients in our clinical studies or those of our competitors may result in deaths or other adverse medical events, including those due to other therapies or medications that such patients may be using. Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining regulatory approval or market acceptance of our product candidates and impair our ability to achieve profitability.

Research and development of biopharmaceutical products is inherently risky. We may not be successful in our efforts to use and enhance our genome editing technology to create a pipeline of product candidates, establish the necessary manufacturing capabilities, obtain regulatory approval and develop commercially successful products, or we may expend our limited resources on programs that do not yield a successful product candidate and fail to capitalize on potential product candidates or diseases that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. If we fail to develop product candidates, our commercial opportunity, if any, will be limited.

We are at a clinical stage of development and our technology and approach has not yet led, and may never lead, to the approval or commercialization of any of our product candidates, including nex-z for ATTR amyloidosis, NTLA-2002 for HAE, or to our other preclinical stage product candidates being deemed appropriate for clinical development and ultimately approval by a regulatory agency. Even if we are successful in building our pipeline of product candidates, completing clinical development, establishing the necessary manufacturing processes and capabilities, obtaining regulatory approvals and commercializing product candidates will require substantial additional funding and are subject to the risks of failure inherent in therapeutic product development. Investment in biopharmaceutical product development involves significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate acceptable safety and efficacy profiles, gain regulatory approval, or become commercially viable.

We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to successfully advance any of our product candidates, including nex-z, NTLA-2002 or product candidates developed through our collaborations, through the entire research and development process. Any of our other programs may show promise yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development or commercialization for many reasons. For more information regarding these risks, see the above risk factor section entitled “
Risks Related to Preclinical and Clinical Development
.
”

Even if we obtain regulatory approval of any product candidates, such candidates may not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, hospitals, third party payors and others in the medical community.

The use of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to create genome editing-based therapies is a recent development and may not become broadly accepted by patients, healthcare providers, third party payors and other stakeholders. A variety of factors will influence whether our product candidates are accepted in the market, including, for example:

•
the clinical indications for which our product candidates are approved; 

•
the potential and perceived advantages of our product candidates over alternative treatments; 

•
the incidence and severity of any side effects, including any unintended deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) changes; 

•
product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities; 

•
limitations or warnings contained in the labeling approved by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which may include warnings or other information about possible unintended DNA changes; 

•
the timing of market introduction of our product candidates;

•
availability or existence of competitive products; 

•
the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments; 

•
the amount of upfront costs or training required for healthcare providers to administer our product candidates, which may include availability of adequate facilities and equipment; 

•
the availability of adequate coverage, reimbursement and pricing by government authorities and other third party payors; 

•
patients’ ability to access healthcare providers capable of delivering our product candidates; 

•
patients’ willingness and ability to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of coverage and reimbursement by government authorities and other third party payors; 

•
the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies; 

40

•
relative convenience and ease of administration, including as compared to alternative treatments and competitive therapies; 

•
any restrictions on the use of our product candidates together with other medications; 

•
interactions of our product candidates with other medicines patients are taking; 

•
potential adverse events for any products developed, or negative interactions with regulatory agencies, by us or others in the gene therapy and genome editing fields; and 

•
the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and distribution support. 

Even if our products achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to maintain that market acceptance over time if new products or technologies are introduced that are more favorably received than our products, are more cost effective or render our products obsolete. In addition, adverse publicity due to the ethical and social controversies surrounding the therapeutic 
in vivo 
use of CRISPR/Cas9, genome edited modified cells, or other therapeutics mediums, such as viral vectors that we may use in our clinical trials may limit market acceptance of our product candidates. If our product candidates are approved but fail to achieve market acceptance among physicians, patients, hospitals, third party payors or others in the medical community, we will not be able to generate significant revenue. Our efforts to educate the healthcare providers, patients and third party payors about our products may require significant resources and may never be successful.

Risks Related to Intellectual Property

Risks Related to Third Party and Licensed Intellectual Property

Third party claims of intellectual property infringement against us, our licensors or our collaborators may prevent or delay our product discovery, research, development, and/or commercialization efforts.

Our commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the valid patents and proprietary rights of third parties.

Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing our product candidates and in areas potentially related to components and methods we use or may use in our research, development, and commercialization efforts. As our product candidates advance through development, as research in the fields in which we work expands, and as more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates, or the resulting products, may give rise to claims of infringement of patent rights owned or controlled by third parties. Our product candidates are complex and may include multiple components, such as Cas9 protein or messenger ribonucleic acid encoding Cas9 protein, guide ribonucleic acids (“gRNAs”), targeting molecules, virus or virus-like particles, or formulation components, such as lipids and lipid nanoparticles. We cannot guarantee that any of these components of our technology, processes, or future product candidates, or the commercialization or use of such product candidates, do not infringe third party patents. It is also possible that we have failed to identify relevant third party patents or applications. Because patent rights are granted jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction, our freedom to practice certain technologies, including our ability to research, develop and/or commercialize our product candidates, or the resulting products, may differ by country.

Third parties may assert that we infringe their patents or that we are otherwise employing their proprietary technology without authorization and may sue us. There may be third party patents with claims to compositions, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods of use or treatment that cover product candidates we discover, research, develop, and/or commercialize. For example, on July 8, 2024, BlueAllele Corp. (“BlueAllele”) filed a complaint alleging infringement by Intellia of various patents in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, as more fully discussed in the Legal Proceedings section below. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies or the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates or products that we develop infringes these patents. If a court of competent jurisdiction were to hold that we infringed such patents, the holders of any such patents may be able to obtain a court order, or other form of relief, blocking our ability to commercialize, manufacture, import, and/or use the applicable product candidate, or resulting products, in the applicable jurisdiction(s) unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or are finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or obtaining such a license may result in significant costs or delays. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be limited in scope or geography or it could be non-exclusive, i.e., our competitors may be able to obtain a similar license on substantially the same or better terms. If we are unable to obtain a license on reasonable terms, we could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing, manufacturing, importing, and/or using the infringing technology or product, or to redesign our infringing products, which could result in significant costs or delays. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees if we are found

41

to have willfully infringed a patent. Any of the foregoing assertions or results could materially harm our business, cause significant costs or delays to our plans, and/or prevent us from further developing and commercializing the affected product candidates or products, thereby causing us significant harm.

In addition, we may be obligated to defend and/or indemnify our existing or potential collaborators, clinical investigators, contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”), CROs, consultants or vendors if a third party asserts similar infringement claims against them based on use of our technologies or the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates or products that we develop, including product candidates or products developed with our collaborators.

Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business. Even if we are not found liable for infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property of a third party, such claims could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.

Third parties may seek to obtain intellectual property rights that encompass or overlap with intellectual property that we own or license from them or others. Legal proceedings may be initiated to determine the scope and ownership of these rights, and could result in our loss of intellectual property rights. As discussed above, legal proceedings asserting that we infringe, do not own, or do not have the right to exploit intellectual property rights of a third party could result in legal orders, such as injunctions or other equitable relief, that could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize our product candidates or products that we develop, or require us to obtain a license to such third party’s intellectual property rights, resulting in significant costs or delays. In addition, as discussed above, such legal proceedings could affect product candidates or products developed with our collaborators, which may also require us to defend and/or indemnify our collaborators.

For example, through a license agreement between Caribou Biosciences, Inc. and us (the “Caribou License”), we sublicense the rights of the Regents of the University of California and the University of Vienna (collectively, “UC/Vienna”) to a worldwide patent portfolio that covers methods of use and compositions relating to engineered CRISPR/Cas9 systems for, among other things, cleaving or editing DNA and altering gene product expression in various organisms, including eukaryotic cells. We sublicense the UC/Vienna rights to this patent portfolio for human therapeutic, prophylactic and palliative uses, including companion diagnostics, except for anti-fungal and anti-microbial uses. Because UC/Vienna co-own this portfolio with Dr. Emmanuelle Charpentier (who has separately licensed her rights to other parties), we refer to this co-owned worldwide patent portfolio as the “UC/Vienna/Charpentier patent family.” In addition, we have granted further sublicenses to this portfolio to our collaborators in certain fields of use. The UC/Vienna/Charpentier patent portfolio to-date includes, for example, multiple granted, allowed, and/or allowable patent applications in the U.S., as well as granted patents from the European Patent Office, the United Kingdom’s Intellectual Property Office, the German Patent and Trade Mark Office, Australia’s Intellectual Property agency and China’s Intellectual Property Office, among others.

Third parties could assert, and have in the past asserted, that our licensors do not have rights to the licensed patents and/or patent applications (such as, in the case of the Caribou License, the UC/Vienna/Charpentier patent family), including inventorship and ownership rights to currently issued or allowable patents. In addition, third parties could assert, and have asserted, that our licensors, or any rights owned by our licensors, such as UC/Vienna/Charpentier, are limited. If such third parties were found to have rights to patents or patent applications covering our licensed technology (such as CRISPR/Cas9 technology), they could assert that we infringe such patents and, as discussed above, we may be required to obtain rights from such parties (e.g., by obtaining a license) or cease our development and commercialization efforts. Even if such third parties are not ultimately successful in their claims, such assertions could result in significant costs or delays to our programs.

For example, various patent applications within the UC/Vienna/Charpentier patent family and the Broad Institute patent family have been involved in patent interferences and other patent challenges in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, in which the respective owners have alleged, and are alleging, that they invented and/or own intellectual property claiming overlapping aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 systems. Specifically, certain patent applications within the UC/Vienna/Charpentier patent family, licensed to us under the Caribou License, covering certain aspects of CRISPR/Cas9 systems to edit genes in eukaryotic cells, including human cells (collectively, the “UC/Vienna/Charpentier eukaryotic patent family”) have been the subject of patent interferences involving patents and patent application co-owned by the Broad Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Rockefeller University (collectively, the “Broad Institute”) that also claim CRISPR/Cas9 systems to edit genes in eukaryotic cells (collectively, the “Broad Institute patent family”). For example, on June 25, 2019, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) declared an interference between the UC/Vienna/Charpentier eukaryotic patent family and the Broad Institute patent family to determine which research group first invented the use of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology in eukaryotic cells and, therefore, is entitled to the U.S. patents covering that invention. The interference involved 14

allowable patent applications from the UC/Vienna/Charpentier eukaryotic patent family

42

and 13

patents and one patent application from the Broad Institute patent family. On February 28, 2022, the PTAB issued a Decision of Priority and Judgment in the interference finding that the Broad Institute patent family has priority over the UC/Vienna/Charpentier patent family with respect to the subject matter of the interference. An appeal and cross-appeal from the interference are pending at the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit as Case Nos. 22-1594 and 22-1653 (the “Interference Appeal”), and the oral argument occurred on May 7, 2024.

In addition, on December 14, 2020, the PTAB declared an interference between the same 14 allowable patent applications in the UC/Vienna/Charpentier eukaryotic patent family, and one patent application owned by ToolGen, Inc. And, on June 21, 2021, the PTAB declared another interference between the same 14 allowable patent applications in the UC/Vienna/Charpentier eukaryotic patent family and one patent application owned by Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC (a subsidiary of Merck KGaA). Because the patent applications involved in these interferences also purport to cover the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene editing in eukaryotic cells, the PTAB seeks to determine between the various groups which one invented first and is entitled to the resulting U.S. patents. A decision on motions issued in the ToolGen interference on September 28, 2022, and the priority phase of that interference was suspended until a mandate concludes the Interference Appeal. The Sigma-Aldrich interference is in its motions phase, and an order scheduling oral argument issued on October 24, 2022. In addition, other third parties, such as Vilnius University (whose patents we have sublicensed under our Caribou Agreement) and Harvard University, filed patent applications claiming CRISPR/Cas9-related inventions around or within a year after the first patent application filed in the UC/Vienna/Charpentier patent family and allege (or may allege) that they invented one or more of the inventions claimed by UC/Vienna/Charpentier before UC/Vienna/Charpentier. If the USPTO deems the scope of any of such third party’s claims sufficiently overlap with the allowable claims from the applicable patent applications in the UC/Vienna/Charpentier patent family, the USPTO could declare other interference proceedings to determine the actual inventor of such claims.

If either the Broad Institute, ToolGen or Sigma-Aldrich were to succeed in any of their respective interferences, or if other third parties, such as Vilnius University or Harvard University, pursue claims and succeed in such claims, the prevailing party or parties could assert its issued patents against us based on our CRISPR/Cas9-based activities, including research, development, and commercialization of our product candidates or resulting products. In addition, such claims could result in the loss of rights to certain patents and patent applications in the UC/Vienna/Charpentier patent family and, thus, we (and our sublicensees) could lose the benefits that we obtained under our Caribou License to the UC/Vienna/Charpentier patent family. The prevailing party may also assert similar infringement claims against our existing or potential collaborators, clinical investigators, CMOs, CROs, consultants or vendors, and we may be obligated to defend and/or indemnify those parties against such infringement claims. As discussed above, such allegations or litigation may affect our ability to market and sell CRISPR/Cas9-based human therapeutics and may result in significant costs or delays to our programs.

Further, many third parties, including the third parties described above, have also filed patent applications and obtained patents covering aspects of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology in other key jurisdictions, including the EU members, the U.K., China and Japan. If these patents are deemed valid and cover our product candidates or related activities, we could be prevented from developing and/or commercializing all or some of our product candidates, or the resulting products, unless we license the relevant intellectual property or avoid it.

Defense of any potential infringement claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense, would be a substantial diversion of management and other employee resources from our business and may impact our reputation. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, or a third party that we are obliged to defend and indemnify, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties or redesign our infringing products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. In that event, we could be unable to further develop and commercialize our product candidates, which could harm our business significantly. For example, the BlueAllele litigation described above has required us to divert resources to the defense of BlueAllele’s allegations.

We have licensed intellectual property from third parties for use in our programs, and termination or modification of any of these licenses could result in the loss of those intellectual property rights, which could harm our business.

We are dependent on patents, know-how and proprietary technology, both our own and licensed from others, including Caribou. Any termination of these licenses, loss by our licensors of the rights they receive from others, diminution of our rights or those of our licensors, or a finding that such intellectual property lacks legal effect, could result in the loss of significant rights and could harm our ability to commercialize any product candidates.

Disputes have and may arise between us and our licensors (e.g., Caribou), our licensors (e.g., Caribou) and their licensors (e.g., UC/Vienna), or us and third parties that co-own intellectual property with our licensors or their licensors, regarding the scope of our rights to intellectual property that is subject to a license agreement, including those relating to:

43

•
the scope of rights, if any, granted under the license agreement (e.g, the Caribou License) and other issues related to the terms of the license agreement; 

•
whether and the extent to which our technology, products and processes infringe, or derive from, intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the license agreement;

•
whether our licensor or its licensor in the case of a sublicense (e.g., UC/Vienna as Caribou’s licensor in the case of our Caribou License) had the right to grant the license agreement, or whether they are compliant with their contractual obligations to their respective licensor(s); 

•
whether third parties are entitled to compensation or equitable relief, such as an injunction, for our use of the intellectual property without their authorization; 

•
our right to sublicense patent and other rights to third parties, including those under collaborative development relationships; 

•
whether we are complying with our obligations with respect to the use of the licensed technology in relation to our development and commercialization of product candidates; 

•
our involvement in the prosecution, defense and enforcement of the licensed patents and our licensors’ overall patent strategy; 

•
the allocation of ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and by us and our partners; and 

•
the amounts of royalties, milestones or other payments due under the license agreement. 

If disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on acceptable terms or are insufficient to provide us the necessary rights to use the intellectual property, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates. If we or any such licensors fail to adequately protect this intellectual property, our ability to commercialize our products could suffer.

We depend, in part, on our licensors to file, prosecute, maintain, defend and enforce patents and patent applications that are material to our business.

Patents relating to our product candidates are controlled by certain of our licensors or their respective licensors. Each of our licensors or their licensors generally has rights to file, prosecute, maintain and defend the patents we have licensed from such licensor. If these licensors or any future licensees and in some cases, co-owners from which we do not yet have licenses, having rights to file, prosecute, maintain, and defend our patent rights fail to adequately conduct these activities for patents or patent applications covering any of our product candidates, our ability to develop and commercialize those product candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using or selling competing products. We cannot be certain that such activities by our licensors or their respective licensors have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or in our best interests or will result in valid and enforceable patents or other intellectual property rights. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreements with our licensors, the licensors may have the right to control enforcement of our licensed patents or defense of any claims asserting the invalidity of these patents and, even if we are permitted to pursue such enforcement or defense, we cannot ensure the cooperation of our licensors or, in some cases, other necessary parties, such as the co-owners of the intellectual property from which we have not yet obtained a license. We cannot be certain that our licensors or their licensors, and in some cases, their respective co-owners, will allocate sufficient resources or prioritize their or our enforcement of such patents or defense of such claims to protect our interests in the licensed patents. For example, with respect to our sublicensed rights from Caribou to UC/Vienna/Charpentier intellectual property, UC retained the right to control the prosecution, enforcement and defense of this intellectual property in its license agreement with Caribou and, pursuant to an Invention Management Agreement, shares these responsibilities with CRISPR Therapeutics AG and, under certain circumstances, ERS Genomics, Ltd., as the designated managers of the intellectual property. For these reasons, UC may be unable or unwilling to prosecute certain patent claims that would be best for our product candidates or enforce its patent rights against infringers of the UC/Vienna/Charpentier patent family.

Even if we are not a party to legal actions or other disputes involving our licensed intellectual property, an adverse outcome could harm our business because it might prevent us from continuing to license intellectual property that we may need to operate our business. In addition, even when we have the right to control patent prosecution of licensed patents and patent applications, enforcement of licensed patents, or defense of claims asserting the invalidity of those patents, we may still be adversely affected or prejudiced by actions or inactions of our licensors and their counsel that took place prior to or after our assuming control.

44

We may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining in-licensed rights to product components and processes or other technology for our product development pipeline.

The growth of our business will likely depend in part on our ability to acquire or in-license additional proprietary rights. For example, our programs may involve additional product candidates, delivery systems or technologies that may require the use of additional proprietary rights held by third parties, including competitors. Our ultimate product candidates may also require specific modifications or formulations to work effectively and efficiently. These modifications or formulations may be covered by intellectual property rights held by others, including competitors. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any relevant third party intellectual property rights that we identify as necessary or important to our business operations.

Additionally, we sometimes collaborate with academic institutions to accelerate our preclinical research or development under written agreements with these institutions. Typically, these institutions provide us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution’s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such option, we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified timeframe or under terms that are acceptable to us. If we are unable to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program.

The licensing and acquisition of third party intellectual property rights is a competitive practice and companies that may be more established, or have greater resources than we do, may also be pursuing strategies to license or acquire third party intellectual property rights that we may consider necessary or attractive in order to commercialize our product candidates. More established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their larger size and cash resources or greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete such negotiations and ultimately acquire the rights to the intellectual property surrounding the additional product candidates that we may seek to acquire.

If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to valid third party intellectual property or to maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of such program and our business and financial condition could suffer.

We may be required to pay certain milestones and royalties under our license agreements with third party licensors.

Under our current and future license agreements and other technology agreements, we may be required to pay milestones and royalties based on our revenues, including sales revenues of our products, utilizing the technologies acquired, licensed or sublicensed from third parties, including Caribou and Rewrite Therapeutics, Inc. (“Rewrite”), and these milestones and royalty payments could adversely affect our ability to research, develop and obtain approval of product candidates, as well as the overall profitability for us of any products that we may seek to commercialize. In order to maintain our intellectual property rights under these agreements, we will need to meet certain specified milestones, subject to certain cure provisions, in the development of our product candidates. Further, our counterparties, including our licensors (or their licensors) or licensees, may dispute the terms, including amounts, that we are required to pay under the respective agreements. If these claims were to result in a material increase in the amounts that we are required to pay to our counterparties, including licensors or their licensors, or in a claim of breach of the applicable agreement, our ability to research, develop and obtain approval of product candidates, or to commercialize products, could be significantly impaired.

In addition, these agreements contain diligence milestones and we may not be successful in meeting all of the milestones in the future on a timely basis or at all. We will need to outsource and rely on third parties for many aspects of the clinical development, sales and marketing of our products covered under our license agreements and other technology agreements. Delay or failure by these third parties could adversely affect the continuation of these agreements with their counterparties, including our licensors or their licensors.

Risks Related to Patents and Trademarks

We could be unsuccessful in obtaining or maintaining adequate patent protection for one or more of our products or product candidates, or asserting and defending our intellectual property rights that protect our products and technologies.

We anticipate that we will file additional patent applications both in the U.S. and in other countries, as appropriate. However, we cannot predict:

•
if and when any patents will issue; 

•
the scope, degree and range of protection any issued patents will afford us against competitors, including whether third parties will find ways to invalidate or otherwise circumvent our patents; 

45

•
whether others will apply for or obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications; 

•
whether certain governments will appropriate our intellectual property rights and allow competitors to use them; or 

•
whether we will need to initiate litigation or administrative proceedings to assert or defend our patent rights, which may be costly whether we win or lose. 

Composition of matter patents for biological and pharmaceutical products are generally considered to be the strongest form of intellectual property protection for those types of products, as such patents provide protection without regard to any method of use. We cannot be certain, however, that any claims in our pending or future patent applications covering the composition of matter of our product candidates will be considered patentable by the USPTO or by patent offices in foreign countries, or that the claims in any of our ultimately issued patents will be considered valid and enforceable by courts in the U.S. or foreign countries. Method of use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method, for example a method of treating a certain indication using a product. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products “off-label” for those uses that are covered by our method of use patents. Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method of use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute.

The strength of patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical field can be uncertain, and evaluating the scope of such patents involves complex legal and scientific analyses. The patent applications that we own or in-license may fail to result in issued patents with claims that cover any product candidates or uses thereof in the U.S. or in other foreign countries.

Further, the patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, or in all jurisdictions. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Moreover, in some circumstances, we do not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, covering technology that we license from third parties. We may also require the cooperation of our licensors or other necessary parties, such as the co-owners of the intellectual property from which we have not yet obtained a license, in order to enforce the licensed patent rights, and such cooperation may not be provided. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business.

The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. and we may fail to seek or obtain patent protection in all major markets. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than U.S. law does. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the U.S. and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we will be unable to know with certainty whether we were the first to make any inventions claimed in any patents or patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions, nor can we know whether those from whom we license patents were the first to make the inventions claimed or were the first to file.

The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the U.S. and abroad. There is a substantial amount of litigation as well as administrative proceedings for challenging patents, including interference, derivation, reexamination, and other post-grant proceedings before the USPTO and oppositions and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, involving patents and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we expect this to be true for the CRISPR/Cas9 space as well. As discussed above, a number of third parties have filed oppositions challenging the validity, and seeking the revocation, of several CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing patents granted to UC/Vienna/Charpentier by the European Patent Office (“EPO”). U.S. law also provides for other procedures to challenge patents, including 
inter partes
 reviews, post-grant reviews and, in certain circumstances, interference or derivation proceedings, that add uncertainty to the possibility of challenge to our developed or licensed patents and patent applications in the future. See the above risk factor entitled 
“
Third party claims of intellectual property infringement against us, our licensors or our collaborators may prevent or delay our product discovery, research, development and/or commercialization efforts
.”

Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or freedom to operate or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to practice the invention or stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our

46

owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.

Furthermore, even if they are unchallenged, our patents and patent applications may not adequately protect our intellectual property or prevent others from designing their products to avoid being covered by our claims. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patent applications we hold is threatened, this could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop, and could threaten our ability to commercialize, product candidates. Further, if we encounter delays in our clinical trials, the period of time during which we could market product candidates under patent protection would be reduced. Because patent applications in the U.S. and most other countries are confidential for a period of time after filing, we cannot be certain that we were the first to file any patent application related to our product candidates.

Our pending and future patent applications or the patent applications that we obtain rights to through in-licensing arrangements may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or future product candidates, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the U.S. and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.

Litigation or other administrative proceedings challenging our intellectual property, including interferences, derivation, reexamination, 
inter partes
 reviews and post-grant reviews, may result in a decision adverse to our interests and, even if we are successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. Furthermore, there could be public announcement of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments in any proceeding challenging the issuance, scope, validity and enforceability of our developed or licensed intellectual property. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.

Any of these potential negative developments could impact the scope, validity, enforceability or commercial value of our patent rights and, as a result, have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

We may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property.

We may in the future be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor or other claims challenging the inventorship of our patents or ownership of our intellectual property (including patents and intellectual property that we in-license). For example, the UC/Vienna/Charpentier patent family that is covered by our license agreement with Caribou is co-owned by UC/Vienna and Dr. Charpentier, and our sublicense rights are derived from the first two co-owners and not from Dr. Charpentier. Therefore, our rights to these patents are not exclusive and third parties, including competitors, may have access to intellectual property that is important to our business. In addition, we may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of collaborators, consultants or others who are involved in developing our technology and product candidates. Litigation or other legal proceedings may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.

We have limited foreign intellectual property rights and may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.

We have limited intellectual property rights outside the U.S. Filing, prosecuting, maintaining and defending patents on product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the U.S. can have a different scope and strength than do those in the U.S. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries, such as China, Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa, do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the U.S. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the U.S., or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the U.S. or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement rights are not as strong as those in the U.S. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or adequate to prevent them from competing. In addition, in jurisdictions outside the U.S., a license may not be enforceable unless all the owners of the intellectual property agree or consent to the license. Further, patients may choose to travel to countries in which we do not have intellectual property rights or which do not enforce these rights to obtain the products or treatment from competitors in such countries.

47

Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, such as China, Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property, particularly those relating to biopharmaceutical products, which could make it difficult in those jurisdictions for us to stop the infringement or misappropriation of our patents or other intellectual property rights, or the marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights. Proceedings to enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Furthermore, such proceedings could put our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable, or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims of infringement or misappropriation against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.

We may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, the patents of our licensors or our licenses, which could be expensive, time-consuming, and unsuccessful.

Competitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To cease such infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file patent infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding or a declaratory judgment action against us, a court may decide that one or more of our patents is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business.

Interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to, or the correct inventorship of, our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors. An unfavorable outcome could result in a loss of our current patent rights and could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Litigation, interference or derivation proceedings may result in a decision adverse to our interests and, even if we are successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.

Further, if a party to our licenses, either a licensee or licensor, were to breach or challenge our rights under the relevant license agreement (or if one of our licensor’s own licensors were to challenge our licensor’s rights), we may have to initiate or participate in a legal proceeding to enforce our rights. Any such legal proceeding could be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, if a court or other tribunal were to rule against us, we could lose key intellectual property and financial rights. Pursuing or defending against these legal claims, regardless of merits, would involve substantial legal expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or contractual litigation there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation or proceeding. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.

Issued patents covering our product candidates could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or before the USPTO or comparable foreign authority.

If we or one of our licensing partners initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our product candidate is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace, and there are numerous grounds upon which a third party can assert invalidity or unenforceability of a patent. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the U.S. or other jurisdictions, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination,
 inter partes
 review, post-grant review and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, such as opposition or derivation proceedings. Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover and protect our product candidates. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity of our patents, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we, our patent counsel, and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity, unpatentability and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our product candidates. For example, as highlighted in the above risk factor entitled “
We could

48

be unsuccessful in obtaining or maintaining adequate patent protection for one or more of our products or product candidates, or asserting and defending our intellectual property rights that protect our products and technologies
,”

various third parties have filed, and may file in the future, challenges to the validity of patents we own or license (e.g., patents or patent applications in the UC/Vienna/Charpentier patent family). If we or the owners of patents we license (e.g., UC/Vienna/Charpentier) fail in defending the validity of these patents, we (and our sublicensees) may lose the benefit of patents and patent applications we own or license (e.g., patents and patent applications licensed under the Caribou License), as discussed above. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business in Europe.

Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.

Periodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. Although an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees, and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. In any such event, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.

If our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.

If our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected. Our unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition among potential partners or future, potential customers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our unregistered trademarks or trade names. Over the long term, if we are unable to successfully register our trademarks and trade names and establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.

Risks Related to Potential Disclosure of Confidential Information

Confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties may not prevent unauthorized disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.

In addition to the protection afforded by patents, we seek to rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary and confidential information. We also utilize proprietary processes for which it would be difficult to enforce patents. In addition, other elements of our product discovery and development processes involve proprietary know-how, information, or technology that is not covered by patents. Trade secrets, however, may be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific advisors, contractors (including CMOs and CROs), and collaborators, and we also rely on federal and state laws requiring our directors, employees, consultants, contractors (including CMOs and CROs), and collaborators to protect our proprietary information. Although we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, outside scientific advisors, contractors, and collaborators might intentionally or inadvertently disclose our trade secret information to competitors. In addition, competitors may otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Furthermore, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the U.S. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the U.S. and abroad. If we are unable to prevent unauthorized material disclosure of our intellectual property to third parties, or misappropriation of our intellectual property by third parties, we may not be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage in our market, which could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Our trade secrets and other confidential information of ours may also be exposed through cybersecurity attacks, ransomware attacks, and other hacking attempts directed at our information technology systems and those

49

of our employees, consultants, outside scientific advisors, contractors, vendors and collaborators. For more information, see the risk factor section entitled “
Risks Related to Data and Privacy.
”

We may be subject to claims that our employees, directors, consultants, or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties.

We have received confidential and proprietary information from third parties. In addition, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies as well as academic research institutions. We may be subject to claims that we or our employees, directors, consultants, or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed confidential information of these third parties or our employees’ former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims, which could result in money damages or a judicial order prohibiting the use of certain intellectual property. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and employees.

Risks Related to Our Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital

Risks Related to Past Financial Condition

We have never generated any revenue from product sales and our ability to generate revenue from product sales and become profitable depends significantly on our success in a number of areas.

We have no products approved for commercial sale, have not generated any revenue from product sales, and do not anticipate generating any revenue from product sales until we have received regulatory approval for the commercial sale of one of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenue, and achieve and retain profitability, depends significantly on our success in many areas, including:

•
obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations for our lead programs;

•
obtaining market acceptance of our product candidates as viable treatment options;

•
launching and commercializing product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approvals and marketing authorizations, either directly or with a collaborator or distributor;

•
accurately assessing the size and addressability of potential patient populations; 

•
addressing any competing technological and market developments; 

•
maintaining, protecting and expanding our portfolio of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how; 

•
avoiding infringement of or obtaining licenses to any valid intellectual property owned or controlled by third parties;

•
negotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter or which may be necessary for us to develop, manufacture or commercialize our product candidates; 

•
maintaining good relationships with our collaborators and licensors;

•
attracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel;

•
developing a sustainable and scalable manufacturing process for product candidates, including establishing and maintaining commercially viable supply relationships with third parties, such as CMOs, and potentially establishing our own manufacturing capabilities and infrastructure; 

•
successfully completing research, preclinical and clinical development of product candidates;

•
investing resources in developing commercial manufacturing and operational infrastructure prior to clinical evidence of safety and efficacy for a given product candidate; and

•
selecting commercially viable product candidates and effective delivery methods. 

Even if one or more product candidates that we discover and develop are approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product candidate and the timing of such costs may be out of our control. If we are not able to generate revenue from the sale of any approved products, we may never become profitable.

50

Our operating history may make difficult the evaluation of our business’s success to date and assessment of our future viability.

We are a clinical-stage company. We were founded and commenced operations in mid-2014. All of our product candidates are still in preclinical development or clinical trials. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully complete any clinical trials, including large-scale, pivotal clinical trials, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture clinical and commercial scale therapeutics, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. Our ability to generate product revenue or profits, which we do not expect will occur for many years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of our product candidates, which may never occur. We may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable product.

Each of our programs may require additional discovery research and then preclinical and clinical development, regulatory approval in multiple jurisdictions, obtaining manufacturing supply, capacity and expertise, building of a commercial organization, substantial investment and significant marketing efforts before we generate any revenue from product sales. In addition, our product candidates must be approved for marketing by the FDA, or certain other foreign regulatory agencies, before we may commercialize any product.

Our operating history, particularly in light of the rapidly evolving genome editing field, may make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future performance. Our relatively short history as an operating company makes any assessment of our future success or viability subject to significant uncertainty. We will encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by clinical-stage companies in rapidly evolving fields. If we do not address these risks successfully, our business will suffer.

We have incurred net losses in each period since our inception, anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses in the future and may never achieve profitability.

We are not profitable and have incurred losses in each period since our inception. Our net loss was $519.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $2,177.4 million. We expect these losses to increase as we continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations, seek regulatory approvals for our future product candidates, scale-up manufacturing capabilities, maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio and hire additional personnel to support the development of our product candidates and to enhance our operational, financial and information management systems. We expect to finance our operations through a combination of collaboration revenue, equity or debt financings or other sources, which may include collaborations with third parties.

A critical aspect of our strategy is to invest significantly in our technology to improve the efficacy and safety of potential product candidates that we discover. Even if we succeed in discovering, developing and ultimately commercializing one or more of these product candidates, we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future relating to our substantial research and development expenditures to develop our technologies. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders’ equity and working capital. Further, the net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance.

Risks Related to Future Financial Condition

We may need to raise substantial additional funding to fund our operations. If we fail to obtain additional financing, we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of any product candidates.

Our operations have required substantial amounts of cash since inception, and we expect to spend substantial amounts of our financial resources on our discovery programs going forward and future development efforts. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete preclinical development, manufacture (or have manufactured) product candidates and components, and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of any of our future product candidates in humans. Because preclinical and clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, we may require additional funding to complete these undertakings. Further, if we are able to identify product candidates that are eventually approved, we will require significant additional amounts in order to launch and commercialize our product candidates. For the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Our future capital requirements will depend on and could increase significantly as a result of many factors, including the scope, progress, results and costs of drug discovery, preclinical development, laboratory

51

testing and clinical trials for our current or future product candidates, including additional expenses attributable to adjusting our development plans (including any supply related matters).

We will require additional capital for the further development and commercialization of any product candidates and may need to raise additional funds sooner if we choose to expand more rapidly than we presently anticipate or due to other unanticipated factors. Disruptions in the financial markets in general have made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our fundraising needs.

We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. We have no committed source of additional capital and if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development, manufacture or commercialization of our product candidates or other research and development initiatives. Our collaboration and license agreements may also be terminated if we are unable to meet the payment or other obligations under the agreements. We could be required to seek collaborators for product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available or relinquish or license on unfavorable terms our rights to product candidates in markets where we otherwise would seek to pursue development or commercialization ourselves.

Any of the above events could significantly harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations and cause the price of our common stock to decline.

Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders and restrict our operations.

We will need additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. In addition, the valuation of public companies may require selling equity at lower prices to ensure appropriate capitalization. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.

Unfavorable national or global economic conditions or political developments could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the national or global economy and financial markets. For example, governmental statements, actions or policies, political unrest and global financial crises can cause extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, political unrest or additional global financial crises, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our products, if approved, or our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate, further political developments and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.

Risks Related to Manufacturing and Supply

In vivo 
genome editing products and 
ex vivo 
engineered cell therapies based on CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology are novel, complex and difficult to manufacture.

The manufacturing processes used to produce CRISPR/Cas9-based 
in vivo 
genome editing product candidates and
 ex vivo 
engineered cell therapy

product candidates are novel and complex. In addition, our manufacturing processes may require components that are difficult to obtain or manufacture at the necessary quantities and in accordance with regulatory requirements. Several factors could cause production interruptions, including equipment malfunctions; facility unavailability or contamination; raw material cost, shortages or contamination; natural disasters, such as pandemics or other outbreaks or similar public health crises; disruption in utility services; human error; insufficient personnel; inability to meet legal or regulatory requirements; or disruptions in the operations of our suppliers.

Because our product candidates are regulated as biologics, their processing steps will be more complex than those of most small molecule drugs. Moreover, unlike small molecules, the physical and chemical properties of a complex product such as ours generally cannot be fully characterized. As a result, assays of the finished product or relevant components may not be sufficient to ensure that the product will perform in the intended manner. For this reason, we will employ multiple steps to control the manufacturing process to ensure that the process results in product candidates that meet their specifications, but complications

52

at any one step could adversely impact our manufacturing of products. Further, we may encounter problems achieving adequate quantities and quality of clinical (or, if approved commercial) grade materials that meet the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency’s applicable standards or our specifications with consistent and acceptable production yields and costs. Manufacturing process irregularities, even minor deviations from the normal process, could result in product defects or manufacturing issues that cause lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims and litigation, insufficient inventory or production interruption. In addition, product manufacturing and supply could be delayed if the FDA and other regulatory authorities require us to submit lot samples, testing results and protocols, or if they require that we not distribute a lot until they authorize the product’s release.

We could experience manufacturing problems that result in delays in the development, approval or commercialization of our product candidates or otherwise harm our business.

Certain of our product candidates may require components that are unavailable or difficult to acquire or manufacture at the necessary scale and in compliance with regulatory requirements to support our clinical trials or, if approved, commercial efforts. We expect to continue to rely on third party CMOs to manufacture these components and the final product candidates for the foreseeable future. We may not have full control of these CMOs, and they may prioritize other customers or be unable to provide us with enough manufacturing capacity to meet our objectives. Further, we may rely on CMOs outside the U.S. for certain components of our product candidates and may be subject to importation regulations that may affect our ability to manufacture or increase the cost of our product candidates.

We also may encounter problems developing our own manufacturing capabilities, including hiring and retaining the experienced scientific, engineering, quality and manufacturing personnel needed to operate or supervise the necessary manufacturing processes. These issues could result in delays in production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.

Any of these manufacturing and supply issues or delays could restrict our ability to meet clinical or market demand for our product candidates or products and be costly to us and otherwise harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Further, any problems in manufacturing processes or facilities could make us a less attractive collaborator for potential partners, including larger pharmaceutical companies and academic research institutions, which could limit our access to additional attractive development programs.

Risks Related to Government Regulation

Risks Related to Obtaining Regulatory Approval

While the regulatory framework exists for approval of gene therapy products, including genome editing products, the limited precedent for genome editing products make the regulatory approval process potentially more unpredictable and we may experience significant delays in the clinical development and regulatory approval, if any, of our product candidates.

The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing and distribution of drug products, including genome editing therapeutics and engineered cell therapies, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the U.S. and other regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. For example, we are not permitted to market any drug or biological product, including 
in vivo 
products or engineered cell therapies, until we receive regulatory approval from the relevant regulatory agency, such as the FDA in the U.S. or European Commission in the EU. We expect the novel nature of our product candidates to create challenges or raise questions from regulatory agencies in obtaining regulatory approval. For example, in the U.S., the FDA has not approved any 
in vivo 
gene editing-based therapeutic and has only approved one 
ex vivo
 CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing therapy for human therapeutic use. The FDA may also require a panel of experts, referred to as an Advisory Committee, to deliberate on the adequacy of the safety and efficacy data to support approval. The Advisory Committee’s opinion, although not binding, may significantly impact our ability to obtain approval of our product candidates. Moreover, while we are not aware of any specific genetic or biomarker tests for which regulatory approval would be necessary to advance any of our product candidates to clinical trials or commercialization, regulatory agencies could require the development and approval of such tests. Accordingly, the regulatory approval pathway for such product candidates may be uncertain, complex, expensive and lengthy, as well as different in each jurisdiction, and approval may not be obtained in any, some or all jurisdictions.

Other non-regulatory entities may impact the regulatory agencies’ and ethics committees’ evaluation and approval decision regarding our product candidates. For example, the World Health Organization (“WHO”) has established or recommended standards and registries for research using genome editing technologies. We cannot predict the impact of the WHO’s current and future recommendations, or any policies or actions that ethics committees or regulatory agencies may take in response to such recommendations, on our research, clinical and business plans and results.

53

Patient enrollment is a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials and is affected by many factors, including willingness of physicians to use an experimental therapy, the availability of existing treatments, the trial’s geographic locations and the number of patients in each geographic location. In addition, our ability to enroll and dose patients may be delayed by the relevant regulatory authority, as well as the IRB or another ethics committee (whether local or national). 
For example, as set forth in the National Institutes of Health 
(“NIH”)
 Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules (“NIH Guidelines”), gene therapy clinical trials are also subject to review and oversight by an institutional biosafety committee 
(“IBC”)
, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. Before a clinical trial can begin at any institution, that institution’s IRB and its IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. 
Further, a clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, the relevant IRBs or ethics committees of the trial, or the FDA or other regulatory authorities, or upon a recommendation of the trial’s DMC, due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product candidate, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. If we experience termination of, or delays in the completion of, any clinical trial of product candidates, the commercial prospects for such product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue will be impaired. In addition, any delays in completing any clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue.

We are currently conducting and may in the future conduct other clinical trials for our product candidates outside the U.S., and the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data from such trials.

We are currently conducting our Phase 3 clinical trials of nex-z and NTLA-2002, and may in the future conduct clinical trials for our other product candidates outside the U.S. The acceptance of data from clinical trials conducted outside the U.S. or another jurisdiction by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority may be subject to certain conditions or may not be accepted at all. The FDA will generally not consider the data from a foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND unless (i) the trial was well-designed and well-conducted in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements, including requirements for the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials in a way that provides assurance that the data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety, and well-being of trial subjects are protected, and (ii) the FDA is able to validate the data from the trial through an onsite inspection, if necessary. Additionally, the FDA’s clinical trial requirements, including sufficient size of patient populations and statistical powering, must be met. Many foreign regulatory authorities have similar approval requirements. In addition, such foreign trials would be subject to the applicable local laws of the foreign jurisdictions where the trials are conducted. There can be no assurance that the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority will accept data from trials conducted outside of the U.S. or the applicable jurisdiction. If the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority does not accept such data, it would result in the need for additional trials, which could be costly and time-consuming, and which may result in product candidates that we may develop not receiving approval for commercialization in the applicable jurisdiction.

We have received orphan drug designation for nex-z and NTLA-2002 and may in the future seek orphan drug designation for some of our other product candidates, but we may be unable to obtain such designations or to maintain the benefits associated with orphan drug status, including market exclusivity, which may cause our revenue, if any, to be reduced.

Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the U.S. and Europe, may in response to a request from the sponsor designate products for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a disease or condition with a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the U.S., or a patient population of 200,000 or more in the U.S. when there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the product in the U.S. will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. In the U.S., orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the product and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. In the EU, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) it is unlikely that the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the necessary investment in its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.

54

Generally, if a product with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the approval of another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for that time period. The applicable period is seven years in the U.S. and ten years in the EU (which can be extended to 12 years if the sponsor complies with an agreed-upon Pediatric Investigation Plan). Orphan drug exclusivity may be lost if the FDA or the EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. In addition, the FDA can subsequently approve a marketing application for the same drug, or a product with the same active moiety, for treatment of the same disease or condition if it concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Similarly, the European Commission (“EC”) may grant a marketing authorization to a similar medicinal product for the same indication as an authorized orphan product at any time if it is established that the second product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the authorized product. The FDA and EC also can approve a different drug for the same orphan indication, or the same drug for a different indication, during the orphan exclusivity period.

We have received orphan drug designation from the FDA for nex-z for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis and from the FDA and EC for NTLA-2002 for the treatment of HAE. We may seek orphan drug designation for some of our other product candidates in orphan indications in which there is a medically plausible basis for the use of these product candidates. Even where we obtain orphan drug designation, exclusive marketing rights in the U.S. may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan designated indication and may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. In addition, although we intend to seek orphan drug designation for other product candidates, we may never receive such designations.

The FDA may reevaluate the Orphan Drug Act and its regulations and policies. We do not know if, when, or how the FDA may change the orphan drug regulations and policies in the future, and it is uncertain how any changes might affect our business. In addition, proposed amendments to EU regulations regarding orphan medicines are under consideration that, if implemented, could reduce the current 10-year marketing exclusivity period in the EU for certain orphan medicines. Depending on what changes the FDA and the EC may make to their orphan drug regulations and policies, our business could be adversely impacted.

We have received regenerative medicine advanced therapy (“RMAT”) designation by the FDA for nex-z for the treatment of ATTRv-PN and for NTLA-2002 for the treatment of HAE, and may in the future seek such designation for some of our other product candidates, but such designation may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and we may be unable to obtain or maintain the benefits associated with such designation.

We have received the RMAT designation from the FDA for nex-z for the treatment of ATTRv-PN and NTLA-2002 for the treatment of HAE. A product candidate is eligible for RMAT designation if: (1) it is a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell or tissue product, or a combination product using any such therapies or products; (2) it is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and (3) there is preliminary clinical evidence that indicates that the product candidate has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. This program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of RMATs. A BLA for a product candidate with RMAT designation may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through (1) surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit or (2) reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of such designation also include early interactions with the FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. A product candidate that has RMAT designation and is subsequently granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real-world evidence, such as electronic health records, the collection of larger confirmatory data sets, or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval. RMAT designation is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for RMAT designation, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to grant such designation. In any event, the receipt of RMAT designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to product candidates considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualifies for RMAT designation, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification.

Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of product candidates in other jurisdictions.

Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in

55

one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. For example, even if the FDA approves a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must also authorize the marketing and sale of the product candidate in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and review periods different from those in the U.S., including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, as clinical studies conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions outside the U.S., a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be sold in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we are allowed to charge for our products is also subject to approval or to other legal restrictions.

Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. If we fail to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements or to receive applicable marketing approvals, our target markets will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed.

Existing regulatory policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates.

In June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court overruled the 
Chevron
 doctrine, which gave deference to regulatory agencies’ statutory interpretations in litigation against federal government agencies, such as the FDA and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), agencies within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, where the law is ambiguous. This decision may result in more lawsuits against the FDA to challenge longstanding decisions and policies of the FDA, which could undermine the FDA’s authority, lead to uncertainties in the industry, and disrupt the FDA’s normal operations, any of which could delay the FDA’s review of our regulatory submissions. We cannot predict the full impact of this decision, future judicial challenges brought against the FDA, or the nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action. In addition, the leadership, personnel, policies, and/or priorities of government departments and agencies responsible for establishing and operating programs and regulations related to pharmaceutical products, such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, FDA and CMS, may change. New leadership, personnel, policies, priorities, and/or regulations may affect our industry and/or products. For example, FDA or CMS policies and practices concerning gene and cell therapies may change in a way that disparately impacts our product candidates, such as reducing the staff of these agencies or not retaining experienced staff at these agencies who have expertise relevant to our industry and/or products. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.

Risks Related to Ongoing Regulatory Obligations

Even if we receive regulatory approval of any product candidates or therapies, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates.

If any of our product candidates are approved, they may be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for manufacturing, labeling, packaging, distribution, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, and submission of safety and efficacy data, and other post-market information and potential obligations (such as post-marketing studies), including both federal and state requirements in the U.S. and requirements of comparable foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, we will be subject to continued compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) and GCP, and in certain cases, current good tissue practice (“cGTP”) requirements for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval.

Manufacturers and manufacturers’ facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authority requirements, as applicable, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP and, in certain cases, cGTP requirements, and applicable product tracking and tracing requirements. As such, we and our CMOs will be subject to continual review and inspections to assess compliance with cGMP and adherence to commitments made in any BLA, other marketing applications, and previous responses to inspection observations. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money, and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control.

Any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. For example, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may also require a REMS or similar program as a condition of approval of our product candidates, which could entail requirements for long-term patient follow-up, a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. In addition, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves our product

56

candidates, we will have to comply with their respective legal or regulatory requirements including submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports and registration.

The FDA or other regulatory agencies may seek to impose consent decrees, withdraw approval or prohibit the export or import of a product if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our product candidates, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with our third party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

•
restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of our products, withdrawal of the product from clinical trials or the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls; 

•
manufacturing delays and supply disruptions until issues identified by regulatory inspections are remediated;

•
fines, warning letters or holds on clinical trials; 

•
refusal by the FDA or the relevant regulatory agency to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or suspension or revocation of license approvals;

•
product seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of our product candidates; and 

•
injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties. 

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the U.S. market, and the relevant foreign regulatory agencies do the same in their respective jurisdictions. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.

The FDA’s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. In addition, as discussed above, the U.S. Supreme Court’s June 2024 decision to overturn established case law giving deference to regulatory agencies’ interpretations of ambiguous statutory language has introduced uncertainty regarding the extent to which the FDA’s regulations, policies and decisions may become subject to increasing legal challenges, delays, and/or changes. If we or our collaborators are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or our collaborators are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we or our collaborators may lose any marketing approval that we or our collaborators may have obtained, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.

Our employees, independent contractors, clinical investigators, CMOs, CROs, consultants, collaborators, commercial partners and vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We are exposed to the risk of non-compliance, fraud, misconduct or other illegal activity by our employees, independent contractors, clinical investigators, CMOs, CROs, consultants, collaborators, commercial partners and vendors. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct that fails to: comply with federal and state laws and those of other applicable jurisdictions; provide true, complete and accurate information to the FDA and other regulatory bodies in the U.S. or outside the U.S.; comply with manufacturing standards; comply with federal and state data privacy, security, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations in the U.S. and similar foreign privacy or fraudulent misconduct laws; or report financial information or data accurately; or disclose unauthorized activities to us. If we obtain FDA approval of any of our product candidates and begin commercializing those products in the U.S., our potential exposure under such laws will increase significantly, and our costs associated with compliance with such laws are also likely to increase. These laws may impact, among other things, our current activities with clinical investigators and research patients, as well as proposed and future sales, marketing and education programs. In particular, the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare products and services, as well as certain business arrangements in the healthcare industry, are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, including promotion and marketing of off-label uses of our products, structuring and commission(s), certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or creating fraudulent data in our preclinical studies or clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to

57

detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.

Failure to comply with health and data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.

We and many of our existing or potential collaborators, clinical investigators, CMOs, CROs, consultants or vendors are subject to federal, state, and foreign data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including federal health information privacy laws, state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our collaborators. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (including research institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”), or by comparable laws in other jurisdictions. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we could be subject to civil, criminal, and administrative penalties if we knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by laws or regulations.

Compliance with U.S., both state and federal, and international data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil, criminal and administrative penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. Moreover, clinical trial subjects, employees and other individuals about whom we or our existing or potential collaborators obtain personal information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may limit our ability to collect, use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy rights, failed to comply with data protection laws, or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.

If we, or our collaborators, clinical investigators, CMOs, CROs, consultants or vendors, fail to comply with environmental, health and safety, and laboratory animal welfare laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.

We and many of our existing or potential collaborators, clinical investigators, CMOs, CROs, consultants or vendors are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental, health and safety, and laboratory animal welfare laws and regulations. These legal requirements include those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, as well as those which regulate the care and use of animals in research. Our operations, and those of our collaborators, clinical investigators, CMOs, CROs, consultants or vendors, acting on our behalf, may involve research using research animals and the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations, and those of our collaborators, clinical investigators, CMOs, CROs, consultants or vendors, acting on our behalf, also may produce hazardous waste products. We generally anticipate contracting with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste. We will not be able to eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from any use by us of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.

Although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.

In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety, and laboratory animal welfare laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.

58

Failure to comply with labor and employment laws and regulations could subject us to legal liability and costs, including fines or penalties, as well as reputational damage that could harm our business.

We are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the recruiting, hiring, compensation and treatment of employees and contractors. These laws and regulations cover financial compensation (including wage and hour standards), benefits (including insurance and 401(k) plans), discrimination, workplace safety and health, and workers’ compensation.

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, where most of our employees are based, also has laws that expand on federal laws or create additional rights for employees or obligations for employers. For example, on July 1, 2018, the Massachusetts Equal Pay Act went into effect, which added protections employers must comply with regarding pay equity for “comparable work.” In addition, on July 31, 2024, Massachusetts passed the Frances Perkins Workplace Equity Act, requiring disclosure of the pay range for a particular job under certain circumstances, including job postings, promotions, or when an employee requests. There is currently uncertainty regarding the exact scope of these new legal limits and such uncertainty may remain for the foreseeable future. We may face increased employment and legal costs to ensure we are complying with these laws.

For example, the Massachusetts non-compete law limits the terms under which employers can enter into non-competition agreements with employees. Further, other jurisdictions in which our employees may work limit enforcement of non-competition agreements. Additionally, in California non-competition agreements with employees are generally unenforceable after termination of employment and Illinois contains strict laws affecting the enforcement of non-competition agreements. These non-compete laws may negatively impact our ability to prevent employees from working with direct or indirect competitors in the future and may affect our ability to retain key talent in a competitive market.

Our failure to comply with these and other related laws could expose us to civil and, in some cases, criminal liability, including fines and penalties. Further, government or employee claims that we have violated any of these laws, even if ultimately disproven, could result in increased expense and management distraction, as well as have an adverse reputational impact on us.

Inadequate funding for, substantial changes in leadership, personnel, policies or priorities of, or other disruptions at the FDA and other government agencies in or outside the U.S. could hinder their ability to hire, retain, or deploy key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.

The ability of the FDA and other similar regulatory agencies to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and authorization to accept the payment of user fees, reallocation of resources to address unique or new healthcare issues (or other future public health concerns), and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. In addition, government funding of other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), have had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities.

A prolonged government shutdown in the U.S. or other jurisdictions where we plan to conduct our clinical trials, manufacturing, or other operations, or substantial changes in leadership, personnel, policies or priorities could significantly impact the ability of the relevant agency, such as the FDA, to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Risks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties

Risks Related to Our Reliance on Collaboration Partners

Our technological advancements and any potential for revenue may be derived in part from our collaborations, including, for example, with Regeneron, and if the collaboration or co-development agreements related to a material collaboration were to be terminated or materially altered in an adverse manner, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects would be harmed.

We rely on strategic collaborations to advance our technology and co-develop products that we plan to co-commercialize. If our collaboration partner in a material collaboration fails to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or ultimately commercialize any product candidate from the development programs governed by the respective collaboration agreements, including, e.g., a co-development or co-commercialization agreement, or breaches or terminates our collaboration with it, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed. In addition, any material alteration, in an adverse manner, of any

59

material collaboration agreement, or dispute or litigation proceedings we may have related to a material collaboration in the future could delay development programs, create uncertainty as to ownership of or access to intellectual property rights, distract management from other business activities and generate substantial expense.

As described within Note 9, “Collaborations and Other Arrangements” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have entered into co-development and co-promotion arrangements with Regeneron. Regeneron may change its strategic focus or pursue alternative technologies in a manner that results in reduced, delayed or no revenue to us under these arrangements. For example, Regeneron has a variety of marketed products and product candidates either by itself or with other companies, including some of our competitors. In addition, the corporate objectives of our collaborators, such as Regeneron, may not be consistent with our best interests. Regeneron may change its position regarding its participation and funding of our joint activities, which may impact our ability to successfully pursue those programs.

Our existing and future collaborations will be important to our business. If we are unable to maintain any of these collaborations, or if these collaborations are not successful, our business could be adversely affected.

We have limited capabilities for product development and do not yet have any capability for sales, marketing or distribution. Accordingly, we have entered, and plan to enter, into collaborations with other companies, including our therapeutic-focused collaboration agreements with Regeneron, which we believe can provide such capabilities. For example, in October 2023, we announced an expanded research collaboration with Regeneron to develop therapies for the treatment of neurological and muscular diseases. These current and future therapeutic-focused collaborations could provide us with important technologies and/or funding for our programs and technology. Our existing and future therapeutic collaborations may have a number of risks, including that collaborators:

•
have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply; 

•
may not perform their obligations as expected; 

•
may dispute the amounts of payments owed;

•
may not pursue development and commercialization of any product candidates that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs or license arrangements based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as a strategic transaction that may divert resources or create competing priorities; 

•
may delay, insufficiently fund, stop, initiate new or repeat clinical trials, reformulate a product candidate for clinical testing, or abandon a product candidate; 

•
could develop independently, or with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products and product candidates; 

•
may view product candidates discovered in our collaborations as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause collaborators to cease to devote resources to the development or commercialization of our product candidates; 

•
may dispute ownership or rights in jointly developed technologies or intellectual property;

•
may fail to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements regarding the development, manufacture, sale, distribution or marketing of a product candidate or product;

•
with sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution rights to our product candidates may not commit sufficient resources to the product’s sale, marketing, manufacturing and distribution; 

•
may disagree with us about material issues, including proprietary rights, contract interpretation, payment obligations or the preferred course of discovery, development, sales or marketing, which might cause delays or terminations of the research, development or commercialization of product candidates, lead to additional and burdensome responsibilities for us with respect to product candidates, or result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive; 

•
may not properly maintain or defend their or our relevant intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information or sublicensed intellectual property rights in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation and liability; 

•
may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; 

60

•
could become involved in a business combination or cessation that could cause them to deemphasize or terminate the development or commercialization of any product candidate licensed to it by us; and 

•
may terminate our collaborations, which could require us to raise additional capital to develop or commercialize the applicable product candidates, or lose access to the collaborator’s intellectual property. 

If our therapeutic collaborations do not result in the successful discovery, development and commercialization of products or if a collaborator terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. All of the risks relating to product discovery, development, regulatory approval and commercialization summarized and described in this report also apply to the activities of our therapeutic collaborators.

Additionally, if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to attract new collaborators and our perception in the business and financial communities could be adversely affected.

As part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions or licenses of assets or acquisitions of businesses, or disposition of assets or technologies. For example, in February 2022, we announced the acquisition of Rewrite in order to add additional capabilities to our growing platform, which acquisition included an exclusive license from the Regents of the University of California under certain patents related to DNA writing technology. We also may pursue strategic alliances and joint ventures that leverage our core technology and industry experience. If we decide to collaborate with other companies to discover, develop and commercialize therapeutic products, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators because, for example, third parties have comparable rights to the CRISPR/Cas9 system or similar genome editing technologies. In addition, we have limited experience with acquiring, disposing of or licensing assets or forming strategic alliances and joint ventures. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator’s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator’s evaluation of a number of factors. If we are unable to reach agreements with suitable collaborators on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all, we may have to curtail, delay or abandon discovery efforts or development programs, and the development, manufacture or commercialization of a product candidate, or increase our expenditures and undertake these activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund and undertake discovery, development, manufacturing or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional expertise and additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we fail to enter into collaborations and do not have sufficient funds or expertise to undertake the necessary discovery, development, manufacturing and commercialization activities, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates, manufacture the product candidates, bring them to market or continue to develop our technology and our business may be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, license, strategic alliance or joint venture.

Risks Related to Our Reliance on Other Third Parties

We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely in part on, third parties to manufacture our clinical product supplies, and we intend to rely on third parties for at least a portion of the manufacturing process of our product candidates, if approved. Our business could be harmed if the third parties fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of product inputs or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices or fail to meet legal and regulatory requirements.

We are in the early stages of establishing our own manufacturing facility to provide preclinical, clinical and commercial supply of our product candidates and must rely on outside vendors, such as CMOs, to manufacture supplies and process our product candidates. We are manufacturing and processing product candidate components on a clinical scale and may not be able to successfully continue to do so. We are optimizing and will continue to optimize the manufacturing process for late-stage clinical and commercial supply, and cannot be sure that even minor changes in the process will result in therapies that are safe, pure and potent. We are also unable to predict how changing global economic conditions or ongoing geopolitical conflicts and related global economic sanctions, or potential global health concerns will affect our third party suppliers and manufacturers. Any negative impact of such matters on our third party suppliers and manufacturers may also have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

Any facility that we may have in the future and the facilities used by our CMOs to manufacture our product candidates must be inspected and approved by, as applicable, the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies after we apply for approval or marketing authorization. For the foreseeable future, we will be dependent on our CMO partners to properly manufacture adequate supply of our product candidates and components in a timely manner and in accordance with our specification. We also will depend on these entities for compliance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements for manufacture of our product candidates, including cGMP, and in certain cases, cGTP requirements. If we or our CMOs cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to

61

our specifications and the strict relevant regulatory requirements, we and our CMOs will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for our respective manufacturing facilities. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our CMOs to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel, particularly as we increase the scale of our manufactured material. If the FDA or relevant foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates.

If any CMO with whom we contract fails to perform its obligations, we may be forced to manufacture the materials ourselves, for which we may not have the capabilities or resources, or enter into an agreement with a different CMO, which we may not be able to do on reasonable terms, if at all. In such scenario, our clinical trials supply could be delayed significantly as we establish alternative supply sources. In some cases, the technical skills required to manufacture our product candidates may be unique to the original CMO and we may have difficulty transferring such skills to a back-up or alternate supplier, or we may be unable to transfer such skills at all. In addition, if we are required to change CMOs for any reason, we will be required to verify that the new CMO maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations. We will also need to verify, such as through a comparability study, that any new manufacturing process will produce our product candidate according to the specifications previously submitted to the FDA or another regulatory authority. The delays associated with the verification of a new CMO could negatively affect our ability to develop product candidates or commercialize our products in a timely manner. In addition, changes in manufacturers often involve changes in manufacturing procedures and processes, which could require that we conduct bridging studies between our prior clinical supply used in our clinical trials and that of any new manufacturer. We may be unsuccessful in demonstrating the comparability of clinical supplies which could require the conduct of additional clinical trials.

We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely on, third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines or comply with legal and regulatory requirements, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of or commercialize any potential product candidates.

We currently depend, and expect to continue to depend, upon third parties, including independent investigators, to conduct our clinical trials under agreements with universities, medical institutions, CROs, strategic partners and others. We expect to have to negotiate budgets and contracts with CROs, trial sites and other service and goods providers, which may result in delays to our development timelines and increased costs.

We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely heavily, on third parties over the course of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and, as a result, will have limited control over the clinical investigators and other service providers, and limited visibility into their day-to-day activities, including with respect to their compliance with the approved clinical protocol and other legal, regulatory and scientific standards. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our legal responsibilities. We and these third parties are required to comply with GCP, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, EMA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, clinical investigators and trial sites. If we or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable GCP requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the relevant regulatory authorities may require us to suspend or terminate these trials or perform additional preclinical studies or clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot be certain that, upon inspection, such regulatory authorities will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with the GCP requirements. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP, and in certain cases, cGTP, requirements and may require a large number of test articles for studies involving a large number of test patients.

Our or these third parties’ failure to comply with these requirements or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us to delay, suspend, repeat or terminate clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates applicable federal, state or local, as well as foreign, laws and regulations, such as the fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or privacy and security laws. In jurisdictions such as the U.K. and EU, penalties for violations of privacy laws and other regulations can be financially significant. Further, if any of our CROs, clinical investigators or others involved in our clinical trials fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we could be held responsible for its actions or omissions and be negatively impacted. In the event of non-compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”) and the EU GDPR in such form as incorporated into the laws of the U.K. (“U.K. GDPR,” collectively with EU GDPR referred to as “GDPR”), we could be subject to substantial fines and other penalties, including fines of up to 20.0 million Euros (17.5 million GBP for the U.K. GDPR) or up to 4% of our total worldwide annual turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer

62

associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations.

Any third parties conducting our current or future clinical trials will not be our employees and, except for remedies that may be available to us under our agreements with such third parties, we cannot control whether they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing preclinical, clinical, and nonclinical programs. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other product development activities, which could affect their performance on our behalf. If these third parties fail to meet their contractual obligations, legal requirements or expected deadlines, need to be replaced, or generate inaccurate or substandard clinical data by failing to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to complete development of, obtain regulatory approval of or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.

Public health concerns and measures taken in response by U.S. or other governments may significantly impact our CROs, clinical sites and other service and goods providers, which may affect our ability to initiate and complete preclinical studies and clinical trials.

If any of our relationships with these third party CROs, clinical sites or other third parties terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs, clinical sites or other third parties or to do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional CROs, clinical sites or other providers involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, the transition to a new CRO may result in delays, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with these parties, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.

Risks Related to Data and Privacy

Our internal computer systems, or those of our collaborators or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, incidents, or compromises, which could result in a disruption of our operations and development efforts.

We are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure, and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store, and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including but not limited to intellectual property, such as trade secrets, proprietary business information, and personal information). It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We have also outsourced elements of our operations to third parties, and as a result we manage a number of third party vendors who may or could have access to our confidential information. Our third party collaborators, vendors and service providers (including our CMOs and CROs) also have access to large amounts of confidential information relating to our operations, including our research and development efforts. The size and complexity of our information technology systems, and those of third party vendors, service providers and collaborators, and the large amounts of confidential information stored on those systems, make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or systems failures, or to cybersecurity incidents, breaches or compromises from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third party vendors, service providers, collaborators, and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties.

In addition to such risks, the adoption of new technologies may also increase our exposure to cybersecurity incidents, breaches, compromises and failures. Further, having a significant portion of our workforce working from home for extended periods of time puts us at greater risk of cybersecurity attacks. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication, and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service attacks, attacks enhanced or facilitated by artificial intelligence (“AI”), social engineering, “phishing” scams, ransomware, network security breaches, and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. We and certain of our service providers have been subject to such attacks in the past, and while no such attacks have resulted in a material impact to our business, our company or our service providers may be materially impacted by such attacks in the future. Significant disruptions to our information technology systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss, misappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential information (including but not limited to trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information, and personal information), and could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us and would adversely affect our operations, including our discovery and research and development programs. Any security incidents, compromises or breaches that lead to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our employees or current or future clinical trial participants, could harm our reputation, require us to

63

comply with onerous legal requirements under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, and subject us to significant liability including fines, litigation, and loss of current and future business.

Also, the loss of preclinical or clinical trial data from completed or future preclinical or clinical trials, respectively, could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability, our competitive position could be harmed, and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed. Cybersecurity incidents, breaches, compromises, insider threats and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the types summarized and described above. While we have implemented security measures to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there is no assurance that such measures will prevent service interruptions or security breaches, incidents or compromises that could adversely affect our business.

Interruptions in the availability of server systems or communications with internet or cloud-based services, or failure to maintain the security, confidentiality, accessibility or integrity of data stored on such systems, could harm our business.

We rely upon a variety of internet service providers, third party web hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers and software as a service (“SaaS”) vendors to support our business. Failure to maintain the security, confidentiality, accessibility or integrity of data stored on such systems could result in interruptions in our operations, damage our reputation in the market, increase our service costs, cause us to incur substantial costs, subject us to liability for damages and/or fines, and divert our resources from other tasks, any one of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If our security measures or those of our third party data center hosting facilities, cloud computing platform providers, SaaS vendors or third party service partners, are breached, and unauthorized access is obtained to our data or our information technology systems, we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.

We also do not have control over the operations of the facilities of our cloud service providers, SaaS vendors or our third party web hosting providers, and they also may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, hardware or software outages, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks and similar events or acts of misconduct. In addition, any changes in these providers’ service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet our requirements and operate our business.

Social media platforms and artificial intelligence-based platforms present new risks and challenges to our business.

As social media continues to expand, it also presents us with new risks and challenges. Social media is increasingly being used to communicate information about us, our programs and the diseases our therapeutics are being developed to treat. Social media practices in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are evolving, which creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. For example, patients may use social media platforms to comment on the effectiveness of, or adverse experiences with, a product or a product candidate, which could result in reporting obligations or other consequences. Further, the accidental or intentional disclosure of non-public information by our workforce or others through media channels could lead to information loss. In addition, there is a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us, our products, or our product candidates on any social media platform. The nature of social media prevents us from having real-time control over postings about us on social media. We may not be able to reverse damage to our reputation from negative publicity or adverse information posted on social media platforms or similar mediums. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business including quick and irreversible damage to our reputation, brand image and goodwill.

While we have undertaken measures to restrict the use of public AI platforms, their use by people, including our vendors, suppliers and contractors, with access to our proprietary and confidential information, including trade secrets, may continue to increase and may lead to the release of such information, which may impact our ability to realize the benefit of our intellectual property. We have a process that assesses risks and opportunities for AI deployed at Intellia.

A

growing number of legislators and regulators are adopting laws and regulations and have focused enforcement efforts on the adoption of AI, and use of such technologies in compliance with ethical standards and societal expectations. These developments may increase our compliance burden and costs in connection with use of AI and lead to legal liability if we fail to meet evolving legal standards or if use of such technologies results in harms or other causes of action we did not predict. For example, the EU’s Artificial Intelligence Act (“AI Act”) entered into force on August 1, 2024, with most provisions becoming effective on August 2, 2026. This legislation imposes significant obligations on providers and deployers of AI systems, and encourages providers and deployers of AI systems to account for EU ethical principles in their development and use of these systems. The scope of

64

requirements depends on legal and risk determinations that rely on novel legal provisions that have not yet been interpreted by courts or regulators, and non-compliance can lead to significant fines.

Likewise, in the U.S., several states, including Colorado and California, passed laws that will take effect in 2026, to regulate various uses of AI, including to make consequential decisions. In addition, various federal regulators have issued guidance and focused enforcement efforts on the use of AI in regulated sectors. The FDA, for example, issued guidance on the use of AI in medical devices, requiring detailed risk management and review processes to obtain approvals. If we use AI systems governed by these laws or regulations, we will need to meet higher standards of data quality, transparency, monitoring and human oversight, and we would need to adhere to specific and potentially burdensome and costly ethical, accountability, and administrative requirements, with the potential for significant enforcement or litigation in the event of any perceived non-compliance.

The rapid evolution of AI will require the application of significant resources to design, develop, test and maintain such systems to help ensure that AI is implemented in accordance with applicable law and regulation and in a socially responsible manner and to minimize any real or perceived unintended harmful impacts. The use of certain AI technologies can also give rise to IP risks, including by disclosing or otherwise compromising our confidential or proprietary IP, or by undermining our ability to assert or defend ownership rights in IP created with the assistance of AI tools.

Our vendors may in turn incorporate AI tools into their offerings, and the providers of these AI tools may not meet existing or rapidly evolving regulatory or industry standards, including with respect to privacy and data security. Further, bad actors around the world use increasingly sophisticated methods, including the use of AI, to engage in illegal activities involving the theft and misuse of personal information, confidential information and IP. Any of these effects could damage our reputation, result in the loss of valuable property and information, cause us to breach applicable laws and regulations, and adversely impact our business.

Risks Related to Competition

We face significant competition in an environment of rapid technological change. The possibility that our competitors may achieve regulatory approval before we do or develop therapies that are more advanced or effective than ours may harm our business and financial condition or our ability to successfully market or commercialize our product candidates.

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are extremely competitive in the race to develop new products. While we believe we have significant competitive advantages with our industry-leading expertise in genome editing, clinical development expertise and dominant IP position, we currently face and will continue to face competition for our development programs from companies that use genome editing or gene therapy development platforms and from companies focused on more traditional therapeutic modalities such as small molecules and antibodies. The competition is likely to come from multiple sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many of these competitors may have access to greater capital and resources than us. For any products that we may ultimately commercialize, not only will we compete with any existing therapies and those therapies currently in development, but we will also have to compete with new therapies that may become available in the future.

Specific to our nex-z program, we are aware of other companies that are currently commercializing or developing products and therapies used to treat ATTR amyloidosis, including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, BridgeBio Pharma Inc., Bayer AG, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Metagenomi Technologies, LLC, Novo Nordisk A/S, Pfizer, Inc. and YolTech Therapeutics.

Specific to our NTLA-2002 program, we are aware of other companies that are currently commercializing or developing products used to treat HAE, including ADARx Therapeutics, Inc., Astria Therapeutics Inc., BioCryst Pharmaceuticals Inc., CSL Limited, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pharming Group N.V., Pharvaris N.V. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.

Our platform and product foci are on the development of therapies using CRISPR-based technologies. Genome editing companies focused on CRISPR-based technologies include: Arbor Biotechnologies, Inc., Beam Therapeutics Inc., Caribou Biosciences, Inc., CRISPR Therapeutics AG, EdiGene, Inc., Editas Medicine, Inc., Emendo Biotherapeutics, Inc., Ensoma, Inc., Excision Biotherapeutics, Inc., Integra Therapeutics, S.L., Mammoth Biosciences, Inc., Metagenomi Technologies, LLC, Modalis Therapeutics Inc., nChroma Bio (formerly Chroma Medicine, Inc.), Prime Medicine, Inc., Scribe Therapeutics, Inc., Tessera Therapeutics, Inc., ToolGen, Inc., Tune Therapeutics, Inc., Verve Therapeutics, Inc. and YolTech Therapeutics.

There are also companies developing therapies using additional genome editing technologies, which include Allogene Therapeutics, Inc., bluebird bio, Inc., Cellectis S.A., Editas Medicine, Inc., Life Edit Therapeutics (an ElevateBio Company),

65

Myeloid Therapeutics, Inc., Poseida Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired by Roche Holdings, Inc.), Precision Biosciences, Inc., Prime Medicine, Inc., Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc., Seamless Therapeutics, Inc., Stylus Medicine, Inc. and Tessera Therapeutics, Inc.

We are also aware of companies developing therapies in various areas related to our specific research and development programs. For 
ex vivo
, these companies include Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc., Allogene Therapeutics, Inc., BRL Medicine, Inc., Caribou Biosciences, Inc., CARSgen Therapeutics Corporation, Cellectis S.A., CRISPR Therapeutics AG, Legend Biotech USA, Inc., Poseida Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired by Roche Holdings, Inc.), Precision BioSciences, Inc., and Sana Biotechnology, Inc. For 
in vivo
, these companies include Beam Therapeutics Inc., CRISPR Therapeutics AG, Editas Medicine, Inc., Ensoma, Inc., Metagenomi Technologies, LLC, Orna Therapeutics, Inc., Precision Biosciences, Inc., Prime Medicine, Inc., Tessera Therapeutics, Inc., Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Verve Therapeutics, Inc.

Our competitors will also include companies that are or will be developing other genome editing methods as well as small molecules, biologics, 
in vivo
 gene therapies, engineered

cell therapies and nucleic acid-based therapies for the same indications that we are targeting with our CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutics.

Any advances in gene therapy, engineered cell therapies or genome editing technology made by a competitor may be used to develop therapies that could compete against any of our product candidates.

Many of these competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and financial, scientific, technical, intellectual property, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and other resources than we do, and we may not be able to successfully compete with them.

Even if we are successful in selecting and developing any product candidates, in order to compete successfully we may need to be first-to-market or demonstrate that our CRISPR/Cas9-based products are superior to therapies based on the same or different treatment methods. If we are not first-to-market or are unable to demonstrate such superiority, any products for which we are able to obtain approval may not be commercially successful. Furthermore, in certain jurisdictions, if a competitor has orphan drug status for a product and if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of a competitor’s orphan drug exclusivity, then approval of our product for that indication or disease could potentially be blocked, for example, for up to seven years in the U.S. and 10 years in the EU.

We may never succeed in any or all of these activities and, even if we do, we may never generate revenues that are significant or large enough to achieve profitability. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would decrease our value and could impair our ability to raise capital, maintain our research and development efforts, expand our business or continue our operations.

Risks Related to Commercialization

If, in the future, we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell, market and distribute products based on our technologies, we may not be successful in commercializing our products if and when any product candidates or therapies are approved and we may not be able to generate any revenue.

We do not currently have a sales, marketing or distribution infrastructure and, as a company, have no experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of therapeutic products. To achieve commercial success for any approved product candidate for which we retain sales and marketing responsibilities, we must build our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. There are risks involved with both establishing our own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services.

Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product candidates include:

•
our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel; 

•
the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future product candidates that we may develop; 

•
the lack of complementary treatments to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; 

•
the location of patients in need of our product candidates and the treating physicians who may prescribe the products; and 

•
unforeseen costs and expenses, as well as legal and regulatory requirements, associated with creating and operating a sales and marketing organization. 

66

If we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing and distribution services, we would likely have lower product revenue or profitability than if we ourselves were to market and sell our product candidates. In addition, we may be unable to enter into sales and marketing arrangements with third parties, or into arrangements with terms that are favorable to us. We likely will have little control over such third parties and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our product candidates effectively. If we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or through third parties, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates, and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects will be materially adversely affected.

Risks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Our Workforce

Our future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.

We are highly dependent on the research and development, clinical, manufacturing, commercialization, legal, financial and business development expertise of John M. Leonard, M.D., our President and Chief Executive Officer, Edward J. Dulac III, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, James Basta, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, Eliana Clark, our Executive Vice President and Chief Technical Officer, Michael P. Dube, our Chief Accounting Officer, David Lebwohl, our Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer and Birgit Schultes, our Executive Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, as well as the other principal members of our management, scientific and clinical teams. Although we have entered into employment arrangements with our executive officers, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain “key person” insurance for any of our executives or other employees.

Execution of our business plans and strategies requires capable personnel with specialized skills and expertise in the research, development, manufacturing and commercialization of biopharmaceutical products, and, as a result, we may encounter difficulties in hiring or retaining capable personnel in key positions.

Recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel will also be important for our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives, and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products using our technology. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and research institutions for similar personnel. The market for qualified personnel in the biotechnology space generally, and genome editing and gene therapy fields in particular, in and around the Cambridge, Massachusetts area is especially competitive. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategies. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. Further, some of the qualified personnel that we hire and recruit are not U.S. citizens, and there is uncertainty with regard to their future employment status due to the current U.S. administration’s announced intention of modifying the legal framework for non-U.S. citizens to be employed in the U.S. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.

To help attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees in senior roles, we use equity-based awards and performance-based cash incentive awards. Sustained declines in our stock price, or lower stock price performance relative to competitors, can reduce the retention value of our equity-based awards, which can impact the competitiveness of our compensation. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining existing personnel or recruiting new personnel.

Risks Related to Healthcare

Coverage and reimbursement may be limited or unavailable in certain market segments for our product candidates, if approved, which could make it difficult for us to sell any product candidates or therapies profitably.

The success of our product candidates, if approved, depends on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payors, including government agencies, private health insurers and health maintenance organizations. There is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of any newly approved product, but in particular novel genome editing and engineered cell products. All the therapeutic indications approved by the relevant authorities may not be covered or reimbursed. In addition, we cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for, or accurately estimate the potential revenue from, our product candidates because they are novel treatments for diseases using a new technology and delivery approaches. For more information on coverage and reimbursement see the section entitled “
Business – Government Regulation and Product Approval – 
Coverage and Reimbursement.
”

67

In the U.S. and some other jurisdictions, patients generally rely on third party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S., and commercial payors are critical to new product uptake.

Government authorities and other third party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs and treatments they will cover and the amount of reimbursement. In the U.S., the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private payors often follow CMS’s coverage decisions. Other jurisdictions have agencies, such as the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the U.K., that evaluate the use and cost-effectiveness of therapies, which impact the utilization and price of the medicine in such jurisdiction.

In the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third party payors. As a result, obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a third party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of our products to each potential payor, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained from all or any of them. Even if we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might be insufficient or may require co-insurance or co-payments that patients find unacceptably high, which may prevent us from achieving or sustaining profitability. Additionally, third party payors may not cover, or provide adequate reimbursement for, long-term follow-up evaluations required following the use of our genome editing products.

In addition, each country in which we seek approval to market our product candidates has unique laws and market practices regulating coverage and reimbursement for human therapeutics. Market acceptance and sales of our products in each country will depend on our ability to meet each of these jurisdiction’s requirements for coverage and reimbursement. Further, changes to the country’s existing requirements may also affect our ability to commercialize our products in the future, or achieve profitability from their sale.

We may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, physician payment transparency laws, health information privacy and security laws and anti-corruption laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws or their relevant foreign counterparts, we could face substantial penalties.

The sale, distribution and marketing of human therapeutics and our relationship with healthcare providers are strictly regulated by laws in the U.S. and most other jurisdictions in which we intend to seek approval for our product candidates. In addition, the collection and use of personal information, including Protected Health Information, is regulated by federal, state and foreign privacy, data security and data protection laws. Failure to comply with these laws could impair our ability to properly sell our product candidates in particular jurisdictions and subject us to liability from private and governmental entities. Addressing these diverse and sometimes contradictory requirements in myriad jurisdictions may necessitate that we expend significant resources on compliance efforts. Any failure to comply with these requirements may leave us exposed to possible enforcement actions and potential liability. For more information on these laws and regulations see the section entitled “
Business – Government Regulation and Product Approval – 
Other Healthcare and Privacy Laws.
”

The scope and enforcement of each of these laws is not always certain and is subject to legislative, judicial or prosecutorial changes. Further, because of the breadth of these laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Indeed, U.S. federal and state enforcement bodies have increasingly scrutinized healthcare companies and providers interactions, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the industry. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert the attention of our staff and resources from performing the duties required for the general operation of our business.

The increasingly global nature of our business operations, including clinical development efforts, subjects us to domestic and foreign anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and the U.K. Bribery Act. These activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments that are prohibited under the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or similar laws. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees and agents. However, these safeguards may ultimately prove ineffective, and our employees, consultants, and agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition.

Further, the U.S. federal and state governments, as well as other jurisdictions, have myriad laws regulating the collection, storage, distribution, safeguarding and use of personal information of employees, patients, agents, and others. These different laws

68

governing the privacy and security of health and other personal information often differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effective requirements, thus complicating efforts to comply with their respective provisions. For example:

•
the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires covered companies to provide disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers rights with respect to their personal information, including the rights to request deletion of their information, receive the information on record for them, know what categories of information are being maintained about them, and opt-out of certain sales of their information. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for certain data breaches that result in the loss of personal information, which may increase the likelihood of, and risks associated with, data breach litigation. The CCPA was amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2023, and substantially modified the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information, establishing a state agency vested with the authority to enforce the CCPA and by creating additional obligations with respect to the processing of personal information, including regulating personal information collected about employees, applicants and retirees as well as that which is collected in a business to business capacity. We anticipate additional costs associated with CCPA and other U.S. state privacy law compliance and we cannot yet fully determine the impact that such laws, regulations and standards may have on our business;

•
broad consumer privacy and data protection laws have been or are predicted to be passed in a number of additional states. Many state privacy and data protection laws differ from each other in significant ways, and it is not yet fully clear how these laws will be enforced and interpreted. In addition, other states have passed laws regulating specific aspects of privacy. For example, the State of Washington recently passed a law, effective as of March 31, 2024, that regulates health and medical information that is not subject to HIPAA. Similar laws have been passed in Connecticut and Nevada. Additionally, a small number of states have enacted laws that specifically target the collection and use of biometric information. Furthermore, other U.S. states have enacted stringent data security laws; and

•
around the world, many countries have enacted laws that regulate data protection. In the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the collection and use of personal data is regulated by the GDPR and the member states’ related data protection and privacy laws. As the GDPR applies not only to businesses that are established within the EEA or the U.K. but also to any business that offers goods or services to individuals in those territories, it could apply to us. The GDPR imposes strict requirements, including requirements to ensure an appropriate legal basis or condition applies to the processing of personal data, special protections for “sensitive” personal data which includes health and genetic information of individuals in the EEA or the U.K.; disclosures about the personal data use; information retention limitations; mandatory data breach notification requirements; and additional oversight obligations relating to third parties retained to process the personal data. The GDPR grants or enhances the rights of individuals with respect to their personal data, including the rights to object to the processing of the data and request deletion of the same. In addition, the GDPR includes strict requirements on, and prohibits, the transfer of personal data subject to GDPR to jurisdictions that have not been deemed by competent authorities to offer “adequate” privacy protections (“third countries”), unless a derogation exists or a valid GDPR transfer mechanism (for example, the EC approved Standard Contractual Clauses, certification to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (which allows for transfers for relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance and participate in the framework) and the U.K. International Data Transfer Agreement/Addendum) has been put in place and a transfer impact assessment has been carried out. Our compliance with international data transfer obligations under the GDPR, where applicable, may require significant effort and cost, and may limit our ability to transfer such personal data to other jurisdictions or to work with certain service providers that process personal data, and may require us to make strategic considerations around where such personal data is stored. Further, although the EC has acknowledged that the U.K. currently has adequate protections for international data transfers, there may be developments related to the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU (“Brexit”) in the future that result in additional costs and operational challenges in complying with the U.K. GDPR and any other developments regulating the transfer of personal data between the U.K. and EU. For example, the U.K. government has introduced a Data Use and Access Bill (the “U.K. Bill”) into the U.K. legislative process. The aim of the U.K. Bill is to reform the U.K.’s data protection regime following Brexit. If passed, the final version of the U.K. Bill may have the effect of further altering the similarities between the U.K. and EEA data protection regime and threaten the U.K. adequacy decision from the EC. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR may result in warning letters, mandatory audits, orders to cease/change the use of data, and financial penalties, including fines of up to 4% of global revenues, or 20.0 million Euros (17.5 million GBP in the U.K.), whichever is greater. Moreover, data subjects can seek damages for violations, and non-profit organizations can bring claims on behalf of data subjects.

The costs associated with ensuring compliance with these laws, including in particular GDPR, may be onerous and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We may also need to rely on multiple third parties,

69

such as partners and service providers, to meet these legal requirements, which could result in additional liability for us if they do not comply.

Efforts to ensure that we comply with all applicable healthcare and data privacy laws and regulations, as well as other domestic and foreign legal requirements, will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities in the U.S. or outside the U.S. will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future legal requirements. If any noncompliance actions are instituted against us, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, individual imprisonment, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid), contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and affect the results of our operations. Any action alleging a violation of these laws, even if successfully defended, could result in significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales (including importation or exportation) or withdrawal of future marketed products could materially affect business in an adverse way.

Healthcare cost control initiatives, including healthcare legislative and regulatory reform measures, may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

The U.S. and many other jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legal changes affecting the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, affect our ability to profitably sell our product candidates once approved, and restrict or regulate post-approval activities. Changes in the legal requirements, or their interpretation, could impact our business by compelling, for example, modification to: our manufacturing arrangements; product labeling; pricing and reimbursement arrangements; private or governmental insurance coverage; the sale practices for, or availability of, our products; or record-keeping activities. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. For more information on these laws and regulations see the section entitled “
Business – Government Regulation and Product Approval – 
Healthcare Reform.
”

Third party payors, whether domestic or foreign, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions, there have been, and are expected to continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably. In addition, significant uncertainty exists in the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions regarding the provision and financing of healthcare because the elected administrations in such countries have publicly declared their intention to review and potentially significantly modify the current legal and regulatory framework for the healthcare system.

We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare and/or impose price controls may adversely affect:

•
the demand for our product candidates, if we obtain regulatory approval; 

•
our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our approved products; 

•
our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability; 

•
the level of taxes that we are required to pay; and 

•
the availability of capital.

Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors, which may adversely affect our future profitability.

Risks Related to Our Common Stock

Risks Related to Investment in Securities

An active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.

If an active market for our common stock does not continue, it may be difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares without depressing the market price for the shares or sell their shares at or above the prices at which they acquired their shares or sell their shares at the time they would like to sell. Any inactive trading market for our common stock may also impair our ability to

70

raise capital to continue to fund our operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration.

The price of our common stock historically has been volatile, which may affect the price at which you could sell any shares of our common stock.

The market price for our common stock historically has been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell the shares of our common stock, and the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including:

•
the success of our products or technologies or competing products or technologies; 

•
results of clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors; 

•
developments or disputes concerning issued patents, patent applications or other intellectual property rights;

•
regulatory or legal developments in the U.S. and other countries; 

•
the recruitment or departure of key personnel;

•
the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs; 

•
the results of our efforts to discover, develop, manufacture, acquire or in-license our current and additional product candidates or products; 

•
actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts; 

•
variations in our financial results or the financial results of companies that are perceived to be similar to us; 

•
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares; 

•
changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems; 

•
market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;

•
public perception of the safety of genome editing based therapeutics;

•
general economic, industry and market conditions; and 

•
the other factors summarized and described in this 
Risk Factors
 section.

Companies trading in the stock market in general, and in The Nasdaq Global Market in particular, have also experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against companies. Even if the allegations against us are unfounded or we ultimately are not held liable, we may experience related negative publicity resulting in damage to our reputation. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.

If securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.

The trading market for our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. Securities and industry analysts may not publish an adequate amount of research on us, which may negatively impact the trading price for our stock. In addition, if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. Further, if our operating results fail to meet the forecasts of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.

71

Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.

We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.

Risk Related to Ownership Generally

Our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and, if they choose to act together, will be able to control or exercise significant influence over matters subject to stockholder approval.

Our executive officers, directors, 5% or greater stockholders and their affiliates beneficially own a significant percentage of our outstanding voting stock. These stockholders may have the ability to influence us through their ownership positions. These stockholders may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to control elections of directors or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may believe are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.

We have broad discretion over the use of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and may not use them effectively, including that we may be exposed to liquidity issues and other systemic financial risks at the financial institutions holding our cash and cash equivalents.

Our management has broad discretion to use our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to fund our operations and could spend these funds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock. The failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cause the price of our common stock to decline and delay the development of our product candidates. Pending our use to fund operations, we may invest our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value.

A portion of our cash may be held by financial institutions that may have been, or could in the future become, exposed to liquidity issues, bank failures or other systemic financial risks. Our uninsured cash deposits with such financial institutions may be at risk in the event they experience liquidity problems or other financial losses. In addition, although the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and Federal Reserve Board previously provided loans and other programs to mitigate the risk of potential losses from uninsured deposits, there is no guarantee that the U.S. Department of Treasury, FDIC and Federal Reserve Board will provide access to such programs in the future in the event of the closure of other banks or financial institutions, or that they would do so in a timely fashion. We assess our banking relationships as we believe necessary or appropriate, but uncertainty remains over liquidity concerns in the broader financial services industry, and our business, our business partners, or industry as a whole may be adversely impacted in ways that we cannot predict at this time, including our ability to access cash in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our current and/or projected business operations could be significantly impaired by factors that affect the financial institutions with which we have banking relationships, and in turn, us. These factors could include, among others, events such as liquidity constraints or failures, the ability to perform obligations under various types of financial, credit or liquidity agreements or arrangements (including cash management arrangements), disruptions or instability in the financial services industry or financial markets, or concerns or negative expectations about the prospects for companies in the financial services industry. In addition, our vendors, such as our CMOs, CROs or business partners, may be susceptible to the foregoing liquidity or other financial risks and factors, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our current and/or projected business operations and results of operations and financial condition.

We incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.

As a public company, and particularly since we are no longer an “emerging growth company” under applicable SEC regulations, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives.

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”), we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting, including an attestation report on internal control over financial

72

reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. We conduct a process each year to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we dedicate internal resources, engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. This could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements.

Risks Related to Future Financial Condition

Future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock, including pursuant to our equity incentive plans and “at-the-market” offerings, could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of stockholders and could cause our stock price to fall.

We will need additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.

Given the volatility in the capital markets, we may not be willing or able to continue to raise equity capital. We may, therefore, need to turn to other sources of funding that may have terms that are not favorable to us, or reduce our business operations given capital constraints. In addition, sales of a substantial number of shares of our outstanding common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our common stock. Investors who purchase shares in this offering at different times will likely pay different prices, and so may experience different outcomes in their investment results. We will have discretion, subject to market demand, to vary the timing, prices and numbers of shares sold, and there is no minimum or maximum sales price. Investors may experience a decline in the value of their shares as a result of share sales made at prices lower than the prices they paid.

Risks Related to our Charter and Bylaws

Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and adversely affect our stock price.

Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. Therefore, these provisions could adversely affect the price of our stock. Among other things, the certificate of incorporation and by-laws:

•
permit the board of directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, with any rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate; 

•
provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors; 

•
provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law, be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum; 

•
divide the board of directors into three classes; 

•
provide that a director may only be removed from the board of directors by the stockholders for cause; 

•
require that any action to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders, and may not be taken by written consent; 

•
provide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner, and meet specific requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder’s notice; 

•
prevent cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a plurality of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election, if they should so choose); 

73

•
require that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, a stockholder reimburse us for all fees, costs and expenses incurred by us in connection with a proceeding initiated by such stockholder in which such stockholder does not obtain a judgment on the merits that substantially achieves the full remedy sought; 

•
provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, our chief executive officer (or president, in the absence of a chief executive officer) or by the board of directors; and 

•
provide that stockholders will be permitted to amend the bylaws only upon receiving at least two-thirds of the total votes entitled to be cast by holders of all outstanding shares then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. 

In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an “interested” stockholder.

Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws designate certain courts as the sole and exclusive forums for certain disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.

Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for any state law claims for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf alleging state law claims, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our by-laws, any action to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine (the “Delaware Forum Provision”). The Delaware Forum Provision does not apply to claims arising under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. Our by-laws further provide that the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts will be the sole and exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act (the “Federal Forum Provision”). We have chosen the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts as the exclusive forum for such Securities Act causes of action because our principal executive offices are located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Our by-laws provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision.

The Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders in pursuing the claims identified above, particularly if the stockholders do not reside in or near the State of Delaware or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Additionally, the Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than our stockholders.

Risks Related to Tax Matters

Changes in tax law may adversely affect our business and financial condition.

The laws and rules dealing with U.S. federal, state and local income taxation are routinely being reviewed and modified by governmental bodies, officials and regulatory agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Treasury Department. We cannot predict whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, tax laws, regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or issued, that could result in an increase in our or our stockholders’ tax liability.

Our ability to use our net operating loss (
“
NOL
”
) carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.

We have incurred substantial losses during our history and do not expect to become profitable in the near future, and we may never achieve profitability. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire. As of December 31, 2024, we had federal and state NOLs of $1,088.4 million and $1,079.2 million, respectively, some of which begin to expire in 2034. Federal and certain state NOLs

74

generated in taxable years ending after December 31, 2017 are not subject to expiration. As of December 31, 2024, we had federal and state research and development and other credit carryforwards of approximately $139.3 million and $77.9

million, which begin to expire in 2034 and 2029, respectively. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOLs, and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research and development tax credits) to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. During 2022, we completed an assessment of the available net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes under Section 382.

The analysis did not result in a material limitation to our tax attributes and the results of this analysis are reflected herein.

We have not completed an analysis through December 31, 2024. To the extent there was a change in control during 2023 and 2024, our tax attributes could be subject to limitation. We may experience ownership changes in the future. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs and research and development tax credits to offset such taxable income and income tax, respectively, could be subject to limitations. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply. As a result, even if we attain profitability, we may be unable to use a material portion of our NOLs and other tax attributes.

Item 1C. Cybersecurity
Risk management and strategy:
We face a number of cybersecurity risks in connection with our business and recognize the growing threat within the general marketplace and our industry. To help the Company address these risks, 
we have implemented a cybersecurity risk management program that is informed by recognized industry standards and frameworks and incorporates elements of the same, including elements of the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. Our cybersecurity risk management program is 
integrated
 within our enterprise risk management program.

Our cybersecurity risk management program includes a number of components, including but not limited to a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan (“CSIRP”), annual cybersecurity awareness training for our employees, security assessments, vendor risk management, regular 
system maintenance including application of security patches as appropriate, regular penetration testing and implementation of 
enhancements to security measures used to protect our systems and data.

We employ third parties, including assessors, consultants and auditors, in our cyber risk management program as appropriate, e.g., training, assessment, auditing, benchmarking, and penetration testing.

Our CSIRP is designed to guide our incident response process for cybersecurity incidents that could affect our systems, network, or data. The CSIRP identifies the individuals responsible for developing, maintaining, and following appropriate procedures related to identified cybersecurity incidents, including a framework for identifying and addressing material cybersecurity incidents. We periodically test our CSIRP using tabletop exercises with the goal of improving our processes and preparedness.
Risks from 
cybersecurity threats have not to date materially affected us
, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. For more information about the cybersecurity risks we face, see the risk factor entitled 
“Our internal computer systems, or those of our collaborators or other contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches, incidents or compromises, which could result in a disruption of our operations and development efforts”
