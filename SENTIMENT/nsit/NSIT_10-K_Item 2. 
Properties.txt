Properties 
Our principal executive office is located in Chandler, Arizona. At December 31, 2024, we owned or leased approximately 1.7 million square feet of office and warehouse space, and, while approximately 69% of the square footage is in the United States, we own or lease office and warehouse facilities in Canada and in 15 countries in EMEA and we lease office facilities in 7 countries in APAC. We believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes, and we anticipate that we will be able to extend our existing leases on terms satisfactory to us or, if necessary, to locate substitute facilities on acceptable terms. Information about significant sales, distribution, services and administration facilities in use as of December 31, 2024 is summarized in the following table:
