MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Item 7. 
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this report. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A and elsewhere in this report.
Overview
Today, every business is a technology business. We help our clients accelerate their digital journey to modernize their businesses and maximize the value of technology. We serve these clients in North America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”). As a Fortune 500-ranked solutions integrator, we enable secure, end-to-end transformation and meet the needs of our clients through a comprehensive portfolio of solutions, far-reaching partnerships and 36 years of broad IT expertise. We amplify our solutions and services with global scale, local expertise and our e-commerce experience, enabling our clients to realize their digital ambitions in multiple ways. Our offerings in North America and certain countries in EMEA and APAC include hardware, software and services, including cloud solutions. Our offerings in the remainder of our EMEA and APAC segments consist largely of software and certain software-related services and cloud solutions.
Full year 2024 financial and operational highlights included the following:
•
We reported gross profit of $1.8 billion and record gross margin of 20.3%, primarily driven by margin expansion in North America.
•
We generated cash flows from operations of $632.8 million.
•
In May 2024, we acquired Infocenter to strengthen our digital transformation capabilities leveraging their deep expertise in ServiceNow’s comprehensive suite of capabilities. 
On a consolidated basis, for the year ended December 31, 2024:
•
Net sales of $8.7 billion decreased 5% compared to 2023.
•
Gross profit of $1.8 billion increased 6% compared to 2023.
•
Consolidated gross margin expanded approximately 210 basis points to a record 20.3% of net sales in 2024. This increase reflects expansion in margin from services net sales, primarily from growth in Insight Delivered services and cloud solution offerings.
•
Earnings from operations decreased to $388.6 million in 2024, a decrease of 7% compared to the prior year, which represented 4.5% of net sales.
•
Our effective tax rate in 2024 was 25.0%, which compares to our effective tax rate of 25.6% in 2023.
•
Net earnings and diluted net earnings per share were $249.7 million and $6.55, respectively, in 2024. In 2023, we reported net earnings of $281.3 million and diluted net earnings per share of $7.55.
The results of operations for 2024 include the following items:
•
severance and restructuring expenses, net of $25.0 million, $18.6 million net of tax; 
•
acquisition and integration related expenses of $2.7 million, $2.5 million net of tax; and
•
the repurchase of approximately 1.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock for an aggregate cost of $200.0 million.
29
INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)
The results of operations for 2023 include the following items:
•
severance and restructuring expenses, net of $6.1 million, $4.4 million net of tax; 
•
acquisition and integration related expenses of $7.4 million, $6.0 million net of tax; and
•
the repurchase of approximately 1.6 million shares of the Company’s common stock for an aggregate cost of $217.1 million.
In discussing financial results for 2024 and 2023, the Company refers to certain financial measures that are adjusted from the financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.  When referring to non-GAAP measures, the Company refers to them as “Adjusted.”  See the "Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" section below for additional information and a reconciliation of such non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.
Throughout the “Overview” and “Results of Operations” sections of this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” we refer to changes in net sales, gross profit, selling and administrative expenses and earnings from operations on a consolidated basis and in North America, EMEA and APAC excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, which are also considered to be non-GAAP measures. We believe providing this information excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates provides valuable supplemental information to investors regarding our underlying business and results of operations, consistent with how we, including our management, evaluate our performance. In computing the changes in amounts and percentages, we compare the current period amount as translated into U.S. dollars under the applicable accounting standards to the prior period amount in local currency translated into U.S. dollars utilizing the weighted average translation rate for the current period. The performance measures excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.
Net of tax amounts referenced above were computed using the statutory tax rate for the taxing jurisdictions in the operating segment in which the related expenses were recorded, adjusted for the effects of valuation allowances on net operating losses in certain jurisdictions. 
During 2024, we generated $632.8 million of cash from operating activities and primarily utilized cash for strategic acquisitions, to repurchase shares of our common stock, to repay debt and for payment of earnouts and other acquisition related payments. We had net repayments of $554.1 million under our ABL facility and issued $500.0 million in principal amount of Senior Notes. We ended the year with $259.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and $864.1 million of debt outstanding under our long-term debt facilities, including $332.9 million related to the Convertible Notes that are classified as a current liability at December 31, 2024. 
Details about segment results of operations can be found in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. 
Our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial statements, including the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that contributed to those changes, as well as how certain critical accounting estimates affect our consolidated financial statements.
Supply Chain Constraints and Inflation Update
Supply constraints that have had an industry-wide impact since the beginning of 2020 eased in the second half of 2023. We believe that any remaining supply constraints and extended lead times for certain infrastructure, including networking products, have now normalized back to near historic levels. Despite the easing supply constraints, we continue to see a general slowdown in our clients' decision making, which we believe will continue in the short term.  
Inflation contributed to higher interest rates on all of our variable rate facilities in 2024 compared to 2023. While these interest rates are expected to eventually decrease, we continue to anticipate higher than historical rates throughout most of 2025. We are actively monitoring

changes to the global macroeconomic environment, including those impacting our supply chain and interest rates, and assessing the potential impacts these challenges may have on our current results, financial condition and liquidity. We are also mindful of the potential impact these conditions could have on our clients, partners and prospects in 2025 and beyond.

Our gross profit across the business and related to product versus services sales are, and will continue to be, impacted by partner incentives, which can and do change significantly in the amounts made available and the related product or services sales being incentivized by the partner. Incentives from our largest partners are significant and changes in the incentive requirements, which occur regularly, could impact our results of operations to the extent we are unable to effectively shift our focus and efficiently respond to them. For a discussion of risks associated with our reliance on partners, see “Risk Factors – Risks related to Our Business, Operations and Industry – We rely on our partners for product availability, competitive products to sell and marketing funds and purchasing incentives, which can and do change significantly in the amounts made available and the requirements year over year,” in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
Our results of operations include the results of Amdaris, SADA and Infocenter from their respective acquisition dates.

Net sales in North America decreased 4%, or $327.8 million, in 2024 compared to 2023. This net decrease reflects a decrease in hardware net sales, partially offset by increases in software and services net sales. Net sales of hardware decreased 10%, year to year. Net sales of software and services increased 3% and 7%, respectively, year over year. The changes were primarily the result of the following:
•
The decrease in hardware net sales was due to lower volume of sales to large enterprise and corporate clients due to lower demand. This decrease reflects lower sales of devices and infrastructure. We believe these decreases reflect client decisions around timing of device refreshes and investment responses to challenges in the broader macroeconomic environment. We expect this trend could continue into 2025.
•
The increase in services net sales was primarily due to higher sales of cloud solution offerings including from SADA and an increase in sales of Insight Delivered services from SADA and Infocenter, partially offset by declines in sales of Insight Delivered services from our organic business and in software maintenance. Our North America organic business excludes SADA, which we acquired on December 1, 2023 and excludes Infocenter, which we acquired on May 1, 2024.
•
The increase in software net sales was primarily due to a significant multiyear transaction in the first quarter, partially offset by changes in certain vendor relationships (shifting from a principal to agent role), as well as the continued migration of on-premise software to cloud solutions, in each case, reported net in services net sales.

Net sales in EMEA decreased 10% (decreased 11% excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates), or $149.6 million, in 2024 compared to 2023. This net decrease reflects a decrease in software and hardware net sales, partially offset by an increase in services net sales. Net sales of software and hardware were down 20% and 8%, respectively, year to year, partially offset by an increase in services net sales of 23%, year over year. The changes were primarily the result of the following:
•
The decrease in software net sales was primarily due to lower volume of sales to large enterprise and public sector clients and also reflects changes in certain vendor relationships.

•
The decrease in hardware net sales was primarily due to lower volume of sales to public sector clients due to lower demand.
•
The increase in services net sales was due to increased sales of Insight Delivered services from Amdaris, which we acquired in August 2023, partially offset by declines in sales of Insight Delivered services from our EMEA organic business. Our EMEA organic business primarily excludes Amdaris.

Net sales of services and software increased 8% and 5%, respectively, year over year, partially offset by a decrease in hardware net sales of 19% year to year. The net changes were primarily the result of the following:
•
The increase in services net sales was due to higher sales of cloud solution offerings that are recorded on a net sales recognition basis in the services net sales category and increased sales of Insight Delivered services. 
•
The increase in software net sales was primarily due to higher volume of sales to enterprise and public sector clients, partially offset by the continued migration of on-premise software toward higher sales of cloud solution offerings.
•
The decrease in hardware net sales was due to lower volume of sales to large enterprise and corporate clients.

 Gross profit increased 6%, or $96.5 million, in 2024 compared to 2023, with gross margin increasing approximately 210 basis points to 20.3% of net sales.

North America’s gross profit increased 4%, or $56.0 million, in 2024 compared to 2023.  As a percentage of net sales, gross margin expanded by approximately 170 basis points year over year. The year over year net increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the following:
•
A net increase in product margin of 15 basis points year over year. This increase was primarily due to slightly higher margins on software net sales compared to the prior year.
•
An expansion in services margin year over year of 149 basis points was due to higher margins generated from increased cloud solution offerings, including margin expansion contributed by SADA and from increased sales of Insight Delivered services from SADA and Infocenter.  
EMEA’s gross profit increased 13% (increased 11% excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates), or $33.2 million, in 2024 compared to 2023. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin expanded 410 basis points to 20.7%. The year over year net increase in gross margin was primarily attributable to the following:
•
An expansion in services margin year over year of 321 basis points primarily due to higher margins from increased sales of Insight Delivered services from Amdaris.
•
A net increase in product margin of 90 basis points year over year. This increase was primarily due to higher margins on hardware compared to the prior year.
APAC’s gross profit increased 11% (increased 12% excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates), or $7.3 million, in 2024 compared to 2023. As a percentage of net sales, gross margin increased by approximately 270 basis points year over year. The expanded gross margin for APAC in 2024 compared to 2023 was due primarily to changes in sales mix to services net sales, including Insight Delivered services that are sold at higher margins than product net sales. 
Our overall gross margins expanded in 2024 compared to 2023, as expected. We believe this trend could continue into future periods as we focus on selling solutions and increasing our services net sales. As a result of certain partner program changes, we believe we may not experience significant growth in cloud gross profit in 2025 compared to 2024.
Operating Expenses. 
Selling and Administrative Expenses.
 Selling and administrative expenses increased $106.9 million in 2024 compared to 2023. Selling and administrative expenses also increased approximately 190 basis points as a percentage of net sales in 2024 compared to 2023. The overall net increase in expenses reflects an increase of $43.9 million in personnel costs, including teammate benefits, an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $35.5 million, and a net increase in other expenses of $15.5 million, year over year. The increase in personnel costs reflects higher teammate headcount for the majority of 2024 from the acquisitions of Amdaris, SADA and Infocenter, partially offset by reductions in the fourth quarter of 2024, combined with the impact of merit increases. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses were also 
34
INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)
the result of the Amdaris, SADA and Infocenter acquisitions. The net increase in other expenses reflects increases in service agreement expenses and an increase in transformation costs. We incurred transformation costs in 2024 of $18.4 million compared to $16.6 million in 2023. These costs are unique in nature and are not expected to recur in the longer term. These increases in other expenses were partially offset by recoveries in excess of costs incurred of $2.1 million in 2024 related to a third-party data center service outage compared to costs incurred in excess of recoveries of $5.0 million in the prior year combined with net gains of $7.8 million from the change in the revaluation of earnout liabilities, with no such activity in the prior year. On July 29, 2023, a third-party data center that hosts network environments for certain Insight managed services clients, experienced a security incident that resulted in a service outage at the data center. The incident did not impact any of Insight's information systems, credentials, or data. To support our clients that were impacted, the Company paid for certain equipment and services required to resolve the outage.
Severance and Restructuring Expenses, Net.
 During 2024, we recorded severance and restructuring expenses, net of adjustments, totaling $34.0 million. The increase compared to 2023 was primarily due to actions taken to reduce both our teammate count, particularly non-technical resources, as well as strategic reductions in physical locations within the United States. These expenses were partially offset by net gains on the sale of properties due to restructuring of $2.4 million. During 2023, we recorded severance expense, net of adjustments, totaling $12.9 million. These expenses were partially offset by net gains on the sale of properties due to restructuring of $6.8 million.
Acquisition and Integration-related Expenses
.
 During 2024, we incurred $2.7 million in direct third-party costs primarily related to the acquisition of Infocenter. During 2023, we incurred $7.4 million in direct third-party costs primarily related to the acquisitions of SADA and Amdaris. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of our acquisitions.  
Earnings from Operations. 
Earnings from operations decreased 7%, or $31.2 million, year to year, in 2024 compared to 2023. Our earnings from operations and earnings from operations as a percentage of net sales by operating segment were as follows for 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands):

As a percentage of net sales, earnings from operations decreased by approximately 40 basis points to 4.5%. The decrease in earnings from operations was primarily driven by increases in selling and administrative expenses and severance and restructuring expenses, partially offset by an increase in gross profit and a decrease in acquisition and integration related expenses.
EMEA’s earnings from operations increased 21% (increasing 20% excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates), or $8.1 million, year over year, in 2024 compared to 2023.

basis points to 10.0%. The increase in earnings from operations reflects an increase in gross profit, partially offset by increases in selling and administrative expenses, severance and restructuring expenses and acquisition and integration related expenses.
Adjusted Earnings from Operations. 
Adjusted earnings from operations increased 2%, or $10.2 million, year over year, in 2024 compared to 2023. Our Adjusted earnings from operations and Adjusted earnings from operations as a percentage of net sales by operating segment were as follows for 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands):

North America’s Adjusted earnings from operations decreased 1%, or $2.4 million, year to year, in 2024 compared to 2023. As a percentage of net sales, Adjusted earnings from operations increased by approximately 30 basis points to 6.0%. The decrease in Adjusted earnings from operations was primarily driven by increases in selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in gross profit.
EMEA’s Adjusted earnings from operations increased 18% (increasing 16% excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates), or $8.4 million, year over year, in 2024 compared to 2023. As a percentage of net sales, Adjusted earnings from operations increased by approximately 100 basis points to 4.0%. The increase in Adjusted earnings from operations was primarily driven by increases in gross profit, partially offset by an increase in selling and administrative expenses.
APAC’s Adjusted earnings from operations increased 21% (increasing 22% excluding the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates), or $4.3 million, year over year, in 2024 compared to 2023. As a percentage of net sales, Adjusted earnings from operations increased by approximately 170 basis points to 10.5%. The increase in Adjusted earnings from operations reflects an increase in gross profit, partially offset by an increase in selling and administrative expenses.
Non-Operating Expense (Income).
Interest Expense, net.
 Interest expense, net primarily relates to borrowings under our financing facilities and imputed interest under our inventory financing facilities, the Convertible Notes and the Senior Notes, partially offset by interest income generated from interest earned on cash and cash equivalent bank balances. Interest expense increased 41%, or $19.7 million, in 2024 compared to 2023. This was primarily due to the issuance of the Senior Notes and higher loan balances under our ABL facility. This was partially offset by higher interest income earned in 2024 and decreased imputed interest under our inventory financing facilities. Imputed interest under our inventory financing facilities decreased $3.6 million due to lower average daily balances in 2024 compared to 2023. For a description of our various financing facilities, see Notes 7 and 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.
Other (Income) Expense, Net
.
 Other (income) expense, net, consists primarily of foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses result from foreign currency transactions, including foreign currency derivative contracts and intercompany balances that are not considered long-term in nature. The changes in net foreign currency exchange gains/losses are due primarily to the underlying changes in the applicable exchange rates, partially mitigated by our use of foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the effects of fluctuations in foreign currencies on certain of our non-functional currency assets and liabilities.

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)
Income Tax Expense. 
Our effective tax rate for 2024 was 25.0% compared to 25.6% in 2023. The decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to additional research and transferable energy tax credit benefits available in 2024 as compared to 2023. 
The effective tax rate in 2024 was higher than the federal statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to state income taxes and higher taxes on earnings in foreign jurisdictions. These increases were offset partially by research and transferable energy tax credits. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of income tax expense.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted non-GAAP earnings from operations exclude (i) severance and restructuring expenses, net, (ii) certain executive recruitment and hiring related expenses, (iii) amortization of intangible assets, (iv) transformation costs, (v) certain acquisition and integration related expenses, (vi) gains and losses from revaluation of acquisition related earnout liabilities, and (vii) certain third-party data center service outage related expenses and recoveries, as applicable. Adjusted non-GAAP earnings from operations is used by the Company and its management to evaluate financial performance against budgeted amounts, to calculate incentive compensation, to assist in forecasting future performance and to compare the Company’s results to those of the Company’s competitors. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it allows for greater transparency, facilitates comparisons to prior periods and to the Company’s competitors’ results, and assists in forecasting performance for future periods. The non-GAAP financial measure is not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Cash and Cash Flow 
•
Our primary uses of cash during 2024 were to fund the acquisition of Infocenter, repay debt, including principal upon conversion of a portion of the Convertible Notes, fund repurchases of our common stock and to pay earnouts and other acquisition related payments. 
38
INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)
•
Operating activities generated $632.8 million in cash in 2024, compared to $619.5 million in 2023. 
•
We received proceeds from the sale of assets of $13.8 million in 2024, compared to $15.5 million in 2023.
•
We had net

repayments under our inventory financing facilities of $13.6 million in 2024 compared to net repayments of $70.4 million in 2023.
•
Net repayments under our ABL facility were $554.1 million in 2024. Net borrowings under our ABL facility were $299.6 million in 2023. 
•
We issued $500.0 million in principal amount of Senior Notes, which we used to pay down a portion of our borrowings under our ABL facility.
•
Capital expenditures were $46.8 million in 2024 compared to $39.3 million in 2023. 
•
During 2024, we repurchased an aggregate of $200.0 million of our common stock compared to an aggregate of $217.1 million repurchased during 2023.
We anticipate that cash flows from operations, together with the funds available under our financing facilities, will be adequate to support our expected cash and working capital requirements for operations, as well as other strategic acquisitions, over the next 12 months and beyond. We expect existing cash and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating cash activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock, early settlement of a portion of the Warrants in cash (as discussed further below), principal payment on the Convertible Notes that mature in February 2025, debt repayments and repayment of our inventory financing facilities for the next 12 months. We currently expect to fund known cash commitments beyond the next 12 months through operating cash activities and/or other available financing resources.
Net cash provided by operating activities.
•
Cash flow from operating activities in 2024 was $632.8 million, compared to $619.5 million in 2023.

The nominal increase in cash flow from operating activities was partially driven by a decrease in hardware net sales. We have an inverted cash cycle resulting from typically paying partners on shorter terms than we provide to our clients. This generally means in periods of declining hardware sales, we typically generate increased cash from operations.
Our consolidated cash flow operating metrics for the quarters ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

2024
2023
Days sales outstanding in ending accounts
receivable (“DSOs”) (a)
185 
147 
Days inventory outstanding (“DIOs”) (b)
7 
9 
Days purchases outstanding in ending accounts
payable (“DPOs”) (c)
(185)
(127)
Cash conversion cycle (days) (d)
7 
29 
(a)
Calculated as the balance of accounts receivable, net at the end of the period divided by daily net sales. Daily net sales is calculated as net sales for the quarter divided by 92 days.
(b)
Calculated as average inventories divided by daily costs of goods sold. Average inventories is calculated as the sum of the balances of inventories at the beginning of the period plus inventories at the end of the period divided by two. Daily costs of goods sold is calculated as costs of goods sold for the quarter divided by 92 days.
(c)
Calculated as the sum of the balances of accounts payable – trade and accounts payable – inventory financing facilities at the end of the period divided by daily costs of goods sold. Daily costs of goods sold is calculated as costs of goods sold for the quarter divided by 92 days.
(d)
Calculated as DSOs plus DIOs, less DPOs.

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)
•
Our cash conversion cycle was 7 days in the quarter ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of 22 days when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. 
•
The changes in our cash conversion cycle compared to the same period in the prior year resulted from the net effect of a 58 day increase in DPOs and a 2 day decrease in DIOs partially offset by a 38 day increase in DSOs. 
•
The changes in our cash conversion cycle year over year were primarily the result of:
•
The impact to DPOs of netting on certain revenue streams (agent net revenue) that flow through accounts payable on a gross basis while flowing through our income statement on a net basis including a significant agency transaction that based on its terms had not cleared by quarter end as well as changes in vendor mix;
•
the benefit to DIOs of the reduction in hardware sales; and
•
the impact to DSOs of netting on certain revenue streams (agent net revenue) that flow through accounts receivable on a gross basis while flowing through our income statement on a net basis including a significant agency transaction that based on its terms had not cleared by quarter end.   
•
Our cash conversion cycle is impacted by netted costs that we apply to our services net sales to appropriately record net sales that we earn as an agent. These netted costs, while excluded from both net sales and cost of goods sold, are processed and applied to accounts receivable and accounts payable in each reporting period. As a result, our DSO and DPO calculated on the basis of unadjusted net sales and unadjusted cost of goods sold are inherently inflated. Netted costs were $2.2 billion and $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Adjusting our cash conversion cycle calculation by adding netted costs to both daily net sales and daily costs of goods sold results in an increase in our cash conversion cycle from 7 days to 14 days in the fourth quarter of 2024 and a reduction from 29 days to 22 days in the fourth quarter of 2023, which we believe provides a more accurate reflection of our cash flow operating metrics. 
•
We expect that cash flow from operations will be used, at least partially, to fund working capital as we typically pay our partners on average terms that are shorter than the average terms we grant to our clients in order to take advantage of supplier discounts. 
•
We intend to use cash generated in 2025, in excess of working capital needs to pay down our ABL facility and inventory financing facilities, to settle a portion of the Warrants in cash, and for strategic acquisitions. 
Net cash used in investing activities
. 
•
We paid $265.0 million to acquire Infocenter on May 1, 2024, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired of $5.1 million. Additionally, we paid $5.2 million, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, for an entity in our EMEA segment, on July 1, 2024.
•
We acquired SADA and Amdaris for approximately $398.6 million and $82.9 million, respectively, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired and excluding earn outs and hold backs in 2023. 
•
We received proceeds from the sale of assets, including properties held for sale, of $13.8 million and $15.5 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
•
Capital expenditures were $46.8 million and $39.3 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of the capital expenditures in 2024 were used for our new Texas distribution facility and to fund technology related projects.  
•
We expect total capital expenditures in 2025 to be in the range of $35.0 to $40.0 million.

During 2023, we had net borrowings on our long-term debt under our ABL facility of $299.6 million and had net repayments under our inventory financing facilities of $70.4 million. 
•
In 2024, we made earnout and acquisition related payments of $20.3 million associated with our Amdaris and Hanu acquisitions.
•
In 2024, we also funded $200.0 million of repurchases of our common stock, compared to $217.1 million purchased during 2023. 
•
We expect to partially settle the warrants associated with the Convertible Notes in cash in the first half of 2025.
2023 Compared to 2022
For a comparison of our cash flows for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024.
Financing Facilities
Our debt balance as of December 31, 2024 was $864.1 million
.
 As of December 31, 2024, the current portion of our long-term debt primarily relates to the Convertible Notes.  
•
Our objective is to pay our debt balances down while retaining adequate cash balances to meet overall business objectives.
•
The Convertible Notes are subject to certain events of default and certain acceleration clauses. As of December 31, 2024, no such events have occurred.
•
The Senior Notes are subject to certain events of default

and certain acceleration clauses. As of December 31, 2024, no such events have occurred.
•
Our ABL facility contains various covenants customary for transactions of this type, including complying with a minimum receivable and inventory requirement and meeting monthly, quarterly and annual reporting requirements. 
•
The credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. 
•
At December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all such covenants.
•
While the ABL facility has a stated maximum amount, the actual availability under the ABL facility is limited by a minimum accounts receivable and inventory requirement. As of December 31, 2024, eligible accounts receivables and inventory were sufficient to permit access to the full $1.8 billion under the ABL facility of which $39.0 million was outstanding.
We also have agreements with financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from certain suppliers under certain terms and conditions. These amounts are classified separately as accounts payable - inventory financing facilities in our consolidated balance sheets. 
Notes 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report also include: a description of our financing facilities; amounts outstanding; amounts available and weighted average borrowings and interest rates during the year.

Cash Requirements From Contractual Obligations
At December 31, 2024, our contractual obligations for continuing operations primarily consist of:
•
$217.6 million under our inventory financing facilities due in 2025;
•
$96.8 million under operating leases, the majority of which are due from 2025 through 2028;
•
remaining contingent consideration (earnout payments) associated with our acquisition of SADA, up to a maximum of $240.0 million, payable upon certain defined contingencies being met for 2025 and 2026 that would be paid in 2026 and 2027, respectively;
•
contingent consideration (earnout payments) associated with our acquisition of Amdaris, up to a maximum of $9.0 million, payable upon certain defined contingencies being met for 2025 that would be paid in 2026;
•
contingent consideration (earnout payments) associated with our acquisition of Infocenter, up to a maximum of $106.3 million, payable upon certain defined contingencies being met for the years ended April 30, 2025 and April 30, 2026 that would be paid in 2025 and 2026, respectively;
•
a purchase commitment related to cloud services of $78.9 million that must be met by September 2029;
•
a purchase commitment related to software as a service of $26.1 million that must be met by November 2026; 
•
$39.0 million outstanding under our ABL facility maturing in 2027; 
•
$500.0 million

outstanding under our Senior Notes maturing in 2032; and 
•
$333.1 million principal amount due on the Convertible Notes maturing in February 2025.
Undistributed Foreign Earnings
Cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. income taxation upon repatriation to the United States. Certain of our foreign earnings were deemed distributed as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; however, for years subsequent to 2017, we continue to assert indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings for certain of our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $217.0 million in cash and cash equivalents in our foreign subsidiaries, the majority of which reside in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and The Netherlands. Certain of these cash balances will be remitted to the U.S. by paying down intercompany payables generated in the ordinary course of business or through dividend distributions.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
We have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, which include guarantees and indemnifications. These arrangements are discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. We believe that none of our off-balance sheet arrangements have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
Acquisitions
Our strategy includes the possible acquisition of, or investments in, other businesses to expand or complement our operations or to add certain services capabilities. The magnitude, timing and nature of any future acquisitions or investments will depend on a number of factors, including the availability of suitable candidates, the negotiation of acceptable terms, our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions. Financing for future transactions would result in the utilization of cash, incurrence of additional debt, issuance of stock or some combination of the three. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our acquisitions of Infocenter in May 2024, SADA in December 2023, Amdaris in August 2023 and Hanu in June 2022.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)
Inflation
With the exception of the impact on our variable interest rate debt facilities, we have historically not been adversely affected by inflation, as technological advances and competition within the IT industry have generally caused the prices of the products we sell to decline and product life cycles tend to be short. This requires our growth in unit sales to exceed the decline in prices in order to increase our net sales. We believe that most price increases could be passed on to our clients, as prices charged by us are not set by long-term contracts; however, as a result of competitive pressure, there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to our clients.
Critical Accounting Estimates
General
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. For a summary of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results, however, may differ from our estimates. Members of our senior management have discussed the critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. 
We consider the following to be our critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: 
Sales Recognition 
Description
For each of our product and services offerings, the determination needs to be made as to whether we are the principal or the agent in the transaction. This determination leads to how the revenue for each offering is recognized, either gross, where we are the principal in the transaction, or net, where we are the agent in the transaction. This determination is made by assessing whether or not we control the product or service prior to delivery to the client.
Judgments and Uncertainties
If we take control of the product or service prior to delivery to the client, then we are the principal in the transaction. If we do not take control of the product or service prior to delivery to the client, we are the agent in the transaction. The determination of whether we take control of products or services prior to delivery to the client can be judgmental and depends upon the specific facts and circumstances for each transaction. Key assumptions used in our estimates for transactions where we have determined we are the agent are the consistency of transactions with multiple performance obligations and consistency of transactions involving security software. Based on our current methodology to recognize net sales, the amount of reported net sales is not highly sensitive to changes in these key assumptions.  For example, a 5% change in one of our key assumptions would not materially affect our reported net sales.
Effect if actual results differ from assumptions
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to recognize net sales. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, it could have a material effect on our reported net sales, timing of revenue recognition and our results of operations. We have not made any material 
43
INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)
changes in accounting methodology or key assumptions used to recognize net sales during the past three fiscal years.  We have not made any material adjustments to our financial statements as a result of actual results not being consistent with our estimates in the past three fiscal years.
See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of our accounting policies related to sales recognition and for a detailed description of our product and services offerings.
Partner Funding
Description
We receive payments and credits from partners, including consideration pursuant to volume sales incentive programs, volume purchase incentive programs and shared marketing expense programs. Partner funding received pursuant to volume sales incentive programs is recognized as it is earned as a reduction to costs of goods sold. Partner funding received pursuant to volume purchase incentive programs is allocated as a reduction to inventories based on the applicable incentives earned from each partner and is recorded in costs of goods sold as the related inventory is sold. Partner funding received pursuant to shared marketing expense programs is recorded as it is earned as a reduction of the related selling and administrative expenses in the period the program takes place if the consideration represents a reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs. Partner funding received pursuant to certain services delivered is recorded as services net sales. Consideration that exceeds the specific, incremental, identifiable costs is classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold. 
Judgments and Uncertainties
We make period-end estimates about the anticipated achievement levels under the various partner programs in order to accrue amounts earned. These estimates and assumptions primarily include whether we have met key net sales targets under the various partner programs. Based on our current methodology to recognize partner funding, the amount of reported net sales and gross profit is not highly sensitive to changes in key assumptions around achievement levels. For example, a revised assessment of the achievement level for any individual partner program would not materially affect our reported net sales or gross profit.
Effect if actual results differ from assumptions
We have not made any material changes in the methodology or key assumptions used to evaluate estimates of anticipated achievement levels under individual partner programs during the past three fiscal years. 
We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to recognize partner funding.
 However, if our actual results are not consistent with our assumptions it could have a material effect on our results of operations and our cash flows.  
We have not made any material adjustments to our financial statements as a result of actual results for partner funding not being consistent with our estimates in the past three fiscal years.
See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further discussion of our accounting policies related to partner funding.
Goodwill
Description 
We perform an annual review of our goodwill in the fourth quarter of every year. We continually assess if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value and assess whether any indicators of impairment exist. Events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment review include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy

for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant declines in our stock price for a sustained period or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future cash flows or results of operations. Any adverse change in these factors, among others, could have a significant effect on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Judgments and Uncertainties
We may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the goodwill impairment test is not required. In completing a quantitative test for a potential impairment of goodwill, we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its book value, including goodwill. Our reporting units are our operating segments. 
Management must apply judgment in determining the reporting units and in estimating the fair value of our reporting units. Multiple valuation techniques can be used to assess the fair value of the reporting unit, including the market and income approaches. All of these techniques include the use of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially impact the determination of fair value or goodwill impairment, or both. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, an appropriate control premium in excess of the market capitalization of the Company, future market growth, forecasted sales and costs and appropriate discount rates. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. 
Management evaluates the merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair value of the reporting units. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. To ensure the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of our reporting units, we perform a reconciliation of our total market capitalization to the estimated fair value of all of our reporting units. 
Based on qualitative assessments performed in most recent years a quantitative assessment has not been determined to be necessary for any of our reporting units. As such, the amount of reported goodwill is not sensitive to changes in key assumptions.
Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions
We have not made any material changes in the methodology or key assumptions used to evaluate impairment of goodwill during the past three fiscal years. Our assessments in the past three fiscal years have been qualitative assessments and no quantitative assessments have been deemed necessary. Additionally, during each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 we analyzed each of our reporting units and determined that no impairment charge was necessary.
Acquisition Accounting/Business Combinations
Description 
We account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control of a business is obtained, all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values, or other basis as applicable. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.  
We use various models to determine the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed such as the cost method, market method, relief from royalty method, multi-period excess earnings 
45

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)
and discounted cash flow methods. We engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination of identifiable intangible assets.  We may adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation, after the acquisition closing date and through the end of the measurement period of one year or less, as we finalize the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities.
Judgments and Uncertainties
Significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired (particularly intangible assets), liabilities assumed, and contingent consideration. We make estimates and assumptions about projected future cash flows including net sales, gross margin, attrition rates, growth rates, and discount rates based on historical results, business plans, expected synergies, if any, perceived risk and marketplace data considering the perspective of marketplace participants. 
Based on our current methodology to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the amount of intangible assets recognized in each business combination is not highly sensitive to changes in these key assumptions.  For example, with the exception of the discount rate, a 5% change in one of our key assumptions would not materially affect our reported intangible assets balance.
Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions
We have not made any material changes in the methodology or key assumptions used to evaluate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the past three fiscal years. While management believes the expectations and assumptions used in valuing assets acquired and liabilities assumed are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions, which could then result in subsequent impairment. Any such impairment charges could have a material effect on our results of operations. We completed two business combinations in fiscal 2024, including an acquisition in EMEA, and two business combinations in fiscal 2023. We have not made any material adjustments to our financial statements as a result of business combination key assumptions not being consistent with our estimates in the past three fiscal years.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors 
Insight Enterprises, Inc.:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Insight Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 14, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
48
Evaluation of revenue recognition
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service or by arranging for the sales of a vendor’s product or service to a client. The Company measures revenue based on the consideration received in a contract with a client, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company offers hardware and software products, as well as services. Given the number of product and service offerings, significant judgment is exercised by the Company in recognizing revenue, including the following decisions:
•
Determining the point in time when a customer takes control of hardware.
•
Determining the point in time when the customer acquires or renews the right to use or copy software under license and control transfers to the customer.
•
Evaluating the Company as either a principal or an agent for hardware and software products and services, and the related recognition of revenue from the customer on a gross or a net basis.
•
Determining an appropriate pattern of revenue recognition for service performance obligations.
We identified the evaluation of revenue recognition as a critical audit matter because the audit effort to evaluate the Company’s revenue recognition judgments, including those noted above, was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the revenue recognition process, including controls related to the timing and pattern of revenue recognition and gross versus net revenue recognition. As part of testing the Company’s internal controls, we also involved information technology (IT) professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in testing of general IT controls over significant systems and the evaluation of system interface controls and automated controls designed to determine the existence, accuracy, and completeness of revenue. We evaluated the Company’s significant accounting policies related to its product and service offerings by reviewing the terms of certain vendor and customer contracts and comparing the policies to the revenue recognition standard. We selected a sample of revenue transactions and performed the following for each selection:
•
Obtained evidence of a contract with the customer.
•
Compared the amounts recognized and timing of revenue recognition to underlying documentation, including purchase orders, shipping documentation, and evidence of payment, if applicable.
•
Evaluated the Company’s application of their accounting policies to determine the timing and amount of revenue to be recognized.
•
Tested the presentation of revenue as gross or net by comparing the Company’s gross or net presentation to the attributes of the underlying vendor support and the Company’s accounting policy.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors
Insight Enterprises, Inc.:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Insight Enterprises, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 14, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion 
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
50
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(continued)
Acquisition Accounting
The Company accounts for all business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which allocates the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes estimates and assumptions. Initial purchase price allocations are subject to revision within the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition. Acquisition-related expenses and transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to sales recognition, anticipated achievement levels under partner funding programs, assumptions related to stock-based compensation valuation, allowances for doubtful accounts and contract assets, valuation of inventories, valuation of acquired intangible assets, litigation-related obligations, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and impairment of long-lived assets, including purchased intangibles and goodwill, if indicators of potential impairment exist.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
We consider all highly liquid investments with maturities at the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
Book overdrafts represent the amount by which outstanding checks issued, but not yet presented to our banks for disbursement, exceed balances on deposit in applicable bank accounts and a legal right of offset with our positive cash balances in other financial institution accounts does not exist. Our book overdrafts, which are not directly linked to a credit facility or other bank overdraft arrangement, do not result in an actual bank financing, but rather constitute normal unpaid trade payables at the end of a reporting period. These amounts are included within our accounts payable balance in our consolidated balance sheets. The changes in these book overdrafts are included within the changes in accounts payable line item as a component of cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
Restricted cash generally includes any cash that is restricted as to withdrawal or usage. These amounts are included with cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statement of cash flows. All cash receipts/payments with third parties directly to/from restricted cash accounts are reported as an operating, investing or financing cash flow, based on the nature of the transaction.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable
We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our best estimate of probable losses inherent in our accounts receivable balance. The allowance is based on our evaluation of the aging of the receivables, historical write-offs and the current economic environment. We write off individual accounts against the reserve when we no longer believe that it is probable that we will collect the receivable because we become aware of a client’s or partner’s inability to meet its financial obligations. Such awareness may be as a result of bankruptcy filings, or deterioration in the client’s or partner’s operating results or financial position. 
58
INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(continued)
Allowance for Contract Assets
We estimate our allowances for credit losses on contract assets using relevant available information from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Probability of default rates are published quarterly by third-party credit agencies. Adjustments to our initial credit risk ratings may take into account various customer specific factors, including estimated loss given default, the locations in which the customer is operating and macroeconomic conditions. These adjustments result in our internal risk rating categorization as low, moderate or high, as disclosed in Note 2.
Inventories
We state inventories, principally purchased IT hardware, at the lower of weighted average cost (which approximates cost under the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. We evaluate inventories for excess, obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at normal margins. Write-downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account contractual provisions with our partners governing price protection, stock rotation and return privileges relating to obsolescence. Because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the price protection and stock rotation process, estimates are made regarding write-downs of the carrying amount of inventories. Additionally, assumptions about future demand, market conditions and decisions by manufacturers/publishers to discontinue certain products or product lines can affect our decision to write down inventories.
Property and Equipment
We record property and equipment at cost. We capitalize major improvements and betterments, while maintenance, repairs and minor replacements are expensed as incurred. Depreciation or amortization is provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated economic lives of the assets:
Estimated Economic Life
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of underlying lease term or asset life
Furniture and fixtures
2
 – 
7
 years
Equipment
3
 – 
5
 years
Software
3
 – 
10
 years
Buildings
29
 years
External direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal-use computer software and payroll and payroll-related costs for teammates who are directly associated with and who devote time to internal-use computer software development projects, to the extent of the time spent directly on the project and specific to application development, are capitalized.
Reviews are regularly performed to determine whether facts and circumstances exist which indicate that the economic life is shorter than originally estimated or the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. When an indication exists that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of our assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Such impairment test is based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of those assets.

59
INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(continued)
Goodwill
Goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. We may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the goodwill impairment test is not required. The quantitative goodwill impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value. The Company has 
three
 reporting units, which are the same as our operating segments. Multiple valuation techniques would likely be used to assess the fair value of the reporting unit. These techniques include the use of estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or goodwill impairment, or both.
Intangible Assets
We amortize finite lived intangible assets acquired in business combinations using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the intangible assets from the date of acquisition.
We regularly perform reviews to determine if facts and circumstances exist which indicate that the economic lives of our intangible assets are shorter than originally estimated or the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. When an indication exists that the carrying amount of intangible assets may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability of our assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts. Such impairment test is based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value of those assets.
Long-term Accounts Receivable and Contract Assets
We recognize long-term accounts receivable, including unbilled receivables, related to multi-year contracts when we have completed our performance obligations under the contract and where our right to receive consideration from the client is unconditional and based on the passage of time only.
We recognize long-term contract assets related to multi-year contracts when we have completed our performance obligations under the contract but do not have an unconditional right to receive consideration. When our right to consideration is contingent upon other factors, such as a client consuming future services under the contract we recognize a contract asset until our right to receive consideration becomes unconditional.
Leases
We determine if a contract or arrangement is, or contains, a lease at inception. Balances related to operating leases are included in other assets, other current liabilities, and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Balances related to financing leases are included in property and equipment, current portion of long-term debt, and long-term debt in our consolidated balance sheet. Right of use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. 
As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We use the implicit rate when readily determinable. The operating lease ROU 
60
INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(continued)
asset includes any prepaid lease payments and additional direct costs and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.
Self-Insurance 
We are self-insured in the U.S. for medical insurance up to certain annual stop-loss limits and workers’ compensation claims up to certain deductible limits. We establish reserves for claims, both reported and incurred but not reported, using currently available information as well as our historical claims experience.

Treasury Stock
We record repurchases of our common stock as treasury stock at cost. We also record the subsequent retirement of these treasury shares at cost. The excess of the cost of the shares retired over their par value is allocated between additional paid-in capital and retained earnings. The amount recorded as a reduction of paid-in capital is based on the excess of the average original issue price of the shares over par value. The remaining amount is recorded as a reduction of retained earnings.
Sales Recognition
Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a client, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service or by arranging for the sale of a vendor’s products or service to a client.
Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a client, are excluded from revenue. 
We record the freight we bill to our clients as product net sales and the related freight costs we pay as product costs of goods sold. 
Nature of Goods and Services
We sell hardware and software products on both a stand-alone basis without any services and as solutions bundled with services. 
When we provide a combination of hardware and software products with the provision of services, we separately identify our performance obligations under our contract with the client as the distinct goods (hardware and/or software products) or services that will be provided. The total transaction price for an arrangement with multiple performance obligations is allocated at contract inception to each distinct performance obligation in proportion to its stand-alone selling price. The stand-alone selling price is the price at which we would sell a promised good or service separately to a client. We estimate the price based on observable inputs, including direct labor hours and allocable costs, or use observable stand-alone prices when they are available.
Product Offerings
Hardware 
We recognize hardware product revenue on a gross basis at the point in time when a client takes control of the hardware, which typically occurs when title and risk of loss have passed to the client at its destination. Our selling terms and conditions typically specify Free On Board (“F.O.B.”) destination contractual terms such that control is transferred from the Company at the point in time when the product is received by the client. The transaction price for hardware sales is adjusted for estimated product returns that we expect to occur under our return policy based upon historical return rates.
61
INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(continued)
We leverage drop-shipment arrangements with many of our partners and suppliers to deliver products to our clients without having to physically hold the inventory at our warehouses, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing costs. We recognize revenue for drop-shipment arrangements on a gross basis as the principal in the transaction when the product is received by the client because we control the product prior to transfer to the client. In addition to other factors considered, we assume primary responsibility for fulfillment in the arrangement, we assume inventory risk if the product is returned by the client, we set the price of the product charged to the client and we work closely with our clients to determine their hardware specifications.
Warehousing services
We offer a service to our customers whereby clients may purchase product that we procure on their behalf and, at our clients’ direction, store the product in our warehouse for a designated period of time, with the intention of deploying the product to the clients’ designated locations at a later date. These warehousing services are designed to help our clients with inventory management challenges associated with technology roll-outs, product that is moving to end of life, or clients needing integrated stock available for immediate deployment. The client is invoiced, title transfers to the client, and revenue is recognized upon receipt of the product at our warehouse. These product contracts are non-cancelable with customary credit terms beginning the date the product is received in our warehouse and the warranty periods begin on the date of invoice. 
Software 
We recognize revenue from software sales on a gross basis at the point in time when the client acquires the right to use or copy software under license and control transfers to the client. For renewals, revenue is recognized upon the commencement of the software license agreement or when the renewal term begins, as applicable.
A substantial portion of the software licenses we sell are perpetual software licenses and do not require renewal or extension after their initial purchase by the client. Such perpetual licenses are periodically subject to true-up, whereby additional perpetual licenses are sold under the client’s pre-existing master agreement. Such true-ups are generally sold in arrears, and clients are invoiced for the additional licenses they had already been utilizing. Since the client already possessed copies of the licensed software prior to the true-up, software revenue related to the underlying additional licenses is recognized when we agree to the true-up with our client and the partner. 
For sales transactions for certain security software products that are sold with integral third-party delivered software maintenance, we record the software license on a net basis, as the agent in the arrangement.
Services Offerings
Software Maintenance
Software maintenance agreements provide our clients with the right to obtain any software upgrades, bug fixes and help desk and other support services directly from the software publisher at no additional charge during the term of the software maintenance agreements. We act as the software publisher’s agent in selling these software maintenance agreements and do not assume any performance obligation to the client under the agreements. As a result, we are the agent in these transactions and these sales are recorded on a net sales recognition basis. Under net sales recognition, the cost of the software maintenance agreement is recorded as a reduction to sales, resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction, and there are no costs of goods sold. Because we are acting as the software publisher’s agent, revenue is recognized when the parties agree to the initial purchase, renewal or extension as our agency services are then complete. We report all fees earned from activities reported net within our services net sales category in our consolidated statements of operations.
62
INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(continued)
Vendor Direct Support Services Contracts 
Clients may purchase a vendor direct support services contract through us. Under these contracts, our clients call the manufacturer/publisher or its designated service organization directly for both the initial technical triage and any follow-up assistance. We act as the manufacturer/publisher’s agent in selling these support service contracts and do not assume any performance obligation to the client under the arrangements. As a result, these sales are recorded on a net sales recognition basis similar to software maintenance agreements, as discussed above. Because we are acting as the agent, revenue is recognized when the parties agree to the purchase of the support services contract as our agency services are then complete. 
Cloud / Software-as-a-Service Offerings
Cloud or software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) subscription products provide our clients with access to software products hosted in the public cloud without the client taking possession of the software. We act as the agent in selling these software-as-a service subscription products. We do not take control of the software products or assume any performance obligations to the clients related to the provisioning of the offerings in the cloud. As a result, these sales are recorded on a net sales recognition basis. We report all fees earned from activities recognized net within our services net sales category in our consolidated statements of operations. Because we are acting as the agent in the transaction, revenue is recognized when the parties agree to the purchase of the cloud or SaaS offerings as our agency services are then complete. Often, these agency fees are based on end-client usage and therefore are variable throughout the term of the service contract. Where this variable consideration is uncertain, we recognize our agency revenue to the extent that a significant reversal will not occur.
Insight Delivered Services
We design, procure, deploy, implement and manage solutions that combine hardware, software and services to help businesses run smarter. Such services are provided by us or third-party sub-contract vendors as part of bundled arrangements, or are provided separately on a stand-alone basis as technical, consulting or managed services engagements. If the services are provided as part of a bundled arrangement with hardware and software, the hardware, software and services are generally distinct performance obligations. In general, we recognize revenue from services engagements as we perform the underlying services and satisfy our performance obligations.
We recognize revenue from sales of services by measuring progress toward complete satisfaction of the related service performance obligation. Billings for such services that are made in advance of the related revenue recognized are recorded as a contract liability. 
Specific revenue recognition practices for certain of our services offerings are described in further detail below. 
Time and Materials Services Contracts 
We recognize revenue for professional services engagements that are on a time and materials basis based upon hours incurred for the performance completed to date for which we have the right to consideration, even if such amounts have not yet been invoiced as of period end. 
Fixed Fee Services Contracts 
We recognize revenue on fixed fee professional services contracts using a proportional performance method of revenue recognition based on the ratio of direct labor and other allocated costs incurred to total estimated direct labor and other allocated costs. 
63
INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(continued)
OneCall Support Services Contracts 
When we sell certain hardware and/or software products to our clients, we also enter into service contracts with them. These contracts are support service agreements for the hardware and/or software products that were purchased from us. Under certain support services contracts, although we purchase third-party support contracts for maintenance on the specific hardware or software products we have sold, our internal support desk assists the client first by performing an initial technical triage to determine the source of the problem and whether we can direct the client on how to fix the problem. We refer to these services as “OneCall.” We act as the principal in the transaction because we perform the OneCall services over the term of the support service contract and we set the price of the service charged to the client. As a result, we recognize revenue from OneCall extended service contracts on a gross sales recognition basis.  We recognize the revenue ratably over the contract term of the stand ready obligation, generally 
one
 to 
three years
. 
On our consolidated balance sheet, a significant portion of our contract liabilities balance relates to OneCall support services agreements for which clients have paid or have been invoiced but for which we have not yet recognized the applicable services revenue. We also defer incremental direct costs to fulfill our service contracts that we prepay to third parties for direct support of our fulfillment of the service contract to our clients under our contract terms and amortize them into operations over the term of the contracts. 
Third-party Provided Services 
A majority of our third-party sub-contractor services contracts are entered into in conjunction with other services contracts under which the services are performed by Insight teammates. We have concluded that we control all services under the contract and can direct the third-party sub-contractor to provide the requested services. As such, we act as the principal in the transaction and record the services under a gross sales recognition basis, with the selling price being recorded in sales and our cost to the third-party service provider being recorded in costs of goods sold. We recognize revenue for these contracts as the underlying services are performed and we satisfy our performance obligations. For certain third-party service contracts in which we do not control the services prior to transferring to our clients because we are not responsible for fulfillment of the services, we have concluded that we are an agent in the transaction and record revenue on a net sales recognition basis.

Costs of Goods Sold
Costs of goods sold include product costs, direct costs incurred associated with delivering services, outbound and inbound freight costs and provisions for inventory reserves. These costs are reduced by provisions for supplier discounts and certain payments and credits received from partners, as described under “Partner Funding” below.

Selling and Administrative Expenses
Selling and administrative expenses include salaries and wages for teammates who are not directly associated with delivering services, bonuses and incentives, stock-based compensation expense, employee-related expenses, facility-related expenses, marketing and advertising expense, reduced by certain payments and credits received from partners related to shared marketing expense programs, as described under “Partner Funding” below, depreciation of property and equipment, professional fees, amortization of intangible assets, provisions for losses on accounts receivable and contract assets, and other operating expenses.

Partner Funding 
We receive payments and credits from partners, including consideration pursuant to volume sales incentive programs, volume purchase incentive programs and shared marketing expense programs. Partner funding received pursuant to volume sales incentive programs is recognized as it is earned as a reduction to costs of goods sold. Partner funding received pursuant to volume purchase incentive programs is allocated as a reduction to inventories based on the 
64
INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(continued)
applicable incentives earned from each partner and is recorded in cost of goods sold as the related inventory is sold. Partner funding received pursuant to shared marketing expense programs is recorded as it is earned as a reduction of the related selling and administrative expenses in the period the program takes place if the consideration represents a reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs. Consideration that exceeds the specific, incremental, identifiable costs is classified as a reduction of costs of goods sold. Partner funding received pursuant to certain services delivered is recorded as services net sales. The amount of partner funding recorded as a reduction of selling and administrative expenses in our statements of operations totaled $
127,059,000
, 
122,638,000
 and 
128,153,000
 in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Concentrations of Risk
Credit Risk
Although we are affected by the international economic climate, management does not believe material credit risk concentration existed at December 31, 2024. We monitor our clients’ financial condition and do not require collateral. No single client accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in 2024. 
Partner Risk
Purchases from Microsoft and TD Synnex accounted for approximately 
27
% and 
10
%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases in 2024. No other partner accounted for more than 10% of purchases in 2024. Our top five partners as a group for 2024 were Microsoft, TD Synnex (a distributor), Google, Cisco Systems and Ingram Micro (a distributor), and approximately 
55
% of our total purchases during 2024 came from this group of partners. Although brand names and individual products are important to our business, we believe that competitive sources of supply are available in substantially all of our product categories such that, with the exception of Microsoft, we are not dependent on any single partner for sourcing products.
Advertising Costs
Advertising costs are expensed as they are incurred. Advertising expense of approximately $
76,167,000
, $
81,959,000
 and $
88,667,000
 was recorded in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts were predominantly offset by partner funding earned pursuant to shared marketing expense programs recorded as a reduction of selling and administrative expenses, as discussed in “Partner Funding” above.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-based compensation is measured based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant and the corresponding expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the reward. Stock-based compensation expense is classified in the same line item of our consolidated statements of operations as other payroll-related expenses specific to the employee. Compensation expense related to service-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Compensation expense related to performance-based RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards (i.e., a graded vesting basis). Forfeitures are recognized as they occur.

Foreign Currencies
We use the U.S. dollar as our reporting currency. The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are typically the local currencies. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate for each month within the year. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded directly in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax – foreign currency translation adjustments as a separate component of

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(continued)
stockholders’ equity. Net foreign currency transaction gains/losses, including transaction gains/losses on intercompany balances that are not of a long-term investment nature and non-functional currency cash balances, are reported in other expense (income), net within non-operating (income) expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable earnings in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.
We recognize net deferred tax assets to the extent that we believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.
We record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized within the income tax expense line in our consolidated statements of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in our consolidated balance sheets.
Contingencies
From time to time, we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties. We are also subject to various government agency, client and partner audits. We continually assess whether or not such claims have merit and warrant accrual. An accrual is made if it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Such estimates are subject to change and may affect our results of operations and our cash flows.

Net Earnings Per Share (“EPS”)
Basic EPS is computed by dividing net earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each year. Diluted EPS is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding RSUs and certain shares underlying our outstanding convertible senior notes (the "Convertible Notes") and the warrants (the "Warrants") relating to the Call Spread Transactions (as defined in Note 8), as applicable.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In November 2024, 
the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") No. 2024-03, "Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)". The standard requires public business entities to disclose detailed information about specific types of expenses that are relevant to certain line items on the income statement. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. The requirements can be applied prospectively with the option for retrospective application, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ASU No. 2023-09, "Income Taxes (Topic 740)". The standard requires reporting entities to provide disaggregated information on their effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The standard is intended to aid business leaders and investors to make more informed investment decisions. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 and can be applied

prospectively, with an option for retrospective application, and early adoption is allowed. The Company plans to adopt this standard on January 1, 2025. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s disclosures.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures", which requires public entities to disclose information about their reportable segments' significant expenses on an interim and annual basis. The amendments aim to improve interim disclosure requirements, clarify situations where an entity can reveal multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and include other disclosure requirements. The main objective of the amendments is to assist investors in understanding the entity's overall performance and evaluate potential future cash flows. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption being permitted. We adopted the annual requirements of this standard effective January 1, 2024 and will adopt the interim period requirements of this standard effective January 1, 2025. This standard did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures. 
In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, “Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50)”.  This standard is intended to address requests from stakeholders for information about an entity’s use of supplier finance programs and their effect on the entity’s working capital, liquidity, and cash flows. The guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the amendment on roll-forward information requirement, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2023, with the exception of the roll-forward information requirement, which we adopted in the current annual period. The adoption did not have a material effect on the Company's disclosures.

Additionally, for our time and material services contracts, whereby we have the right to consideration from a client in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the client of our performance completed to date, we recognized revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice as of December 31, 2024 and do not disclose information about related remaining performance obligations in the table above.

Assets recognized for costs of obtaining a contract with a customer
Sales commissions are the only significant incremental costs incurred to obtain contracts with our clients.  The majority of our contracts are completed within a one-year performance period, and for contracts with a specified term of one year or less, we recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that we otherwise would have recognized is one year or less.  We record sales commissions on contracts with performance periods that exceed one year as an asset and amortize the asset to expense over the related contract performance period.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related asset balance was $
11,912,291
 and $

Accounts Payable - Inventory Financing Facilities
We have entered into agreements with financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions, as described below. The amounts outstanding under these facilities are classified separately as accounts payable - inventory financing facilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
Inventory Financing Facilities
We have maximum availability under our unsecured inventory financing facility with MUFG Bank Ltd (“MUFG”) of $
280,000,000
. We have maximum availability under our unsecured inventory financing facility with PNC Bank, N.A. (“PNC”) of $
375,000,000
, including a $
25,000,000
 facility in Canada (the "Canada facility"). We also have maximum availability under our unsecured inventory financing facility with Wells Fargo in EMEA (the "EMEA facility") of $
50,000,000
. As of December 31, 2024, our combined inventory financing facilities had a total maximum capacity of $
705,000,000
, of which $
217,604,000
 was outstanding.
The inventory financing facilities will remain in effect until they are terminated by any of the parties.  In the second quarter of 2023, the Company transitioned the reference rate for invoices issued in U.S. Dollars under the PNC facility from LIBOR to the Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("Term SOFR") benchmark provisions.  If balances are not paid within stated vendor terms (typically 60 days), they will accrue interest at prime plus 
2.00
% on the MUFG facility, Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average plus 
4.50
% on the Canada facility and Term SOFR, EURIBOR, or SONIA, as applicable, plus 
4.50
% and 
0.25
% on the PNC (other than the Canada facility) and EMEA facilities, respectively. Amounts outstanding under these facilities are classified separately as accounts payable – inventory financing facilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and within cash flows from financing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. We impute interest on the average daily balance outstanding during these stated vendor terms based on our incremental borrowing rate during the period. Imputed interest of $

On May 14, 2024, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (as amended, the "credit agreement") to modify our senior secured revolving credit facility (the “ABL facility”). The amendment, among other things, releases certain immaterial guarantors from their obligations under the credit agreement. Our maximum borrowing amount under the ABL facility is $
1,800,000,000
, including a maximum borrowing capacity that could be used for borrowing in certain foreign currencies of $
350,000,000
. From time to time and at our option, we may request to increase the aggregate amount available for borrowing under the ABL facility by up to an aggregate of the U.S. dollar equivalent of $
750,000,000
, subject to customary conditions, including receipt of commitments from lenders. The ABL facility is guaranteed by certain of our material subsidiaries and is secured by a lien on certain of our assets and certain of each other borrower’s and each guarantor’s assets. The ABL facility provides for an uncommitted first-in, last-out revolving facility in an aggregate amount of up to $
100,000,000
. The interest rates applicable to borrowings under the ABL facility are based on the average aggregate excess availability under the ABL facility as set forth on a pricing grid in the credit agreement. The ABL facility matures on July 22, 2027. As of December 31, 2024, eligible accounts receivable and inventory permitted availability to the full $
1,800,000,000
 facility amount, of which $
39,000,000
 was outstanding. 
The interest rates applicable to borrowings under the ABL facility are based on the average aggregate excess availability under the ABL facility as set forth on a pricing grid in the credit agreement. Amounts outstanding under the ABL facility bear interest, payable quarterly, at a floating rate equal to SOFR, EURIBOR, AUD Rate, or SONIA, as applicable, plus a pre-determined spread of 
1.25
% to 
1.50
%. The floating interest rate applicable at December 31, 2024 was 
5.90
% per annum for the ABL facility. In addition, we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the facility of 
0.25
%, and our letter of credit participation fee ranges from 
1.25
% to 
1.50
%. During 2024, weighted average borrowings under our ABL facility were $
388,876,000
. Interest expense associated with the ABL facility was $
32,576,000
, $
30,116,000
 and $
21,362,000
 in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, including the commitment fee and amortization of deferred financing fees.
The ABL facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. If a default occurs (subject to customary grace periods and materiality thresholds) under     the credit agreement, certain actions may be taken, including, but not limited to, possible termination of commitments and required payment of all outstanding principal amounts plus accrued interest and fees payable under the credit agreement.
Senior Unsecured Notes due 2032

senior unsecured obligations of the Company and guaranteed by each of the Company's existing and future direct and indirect U.S. subsidiaries that is or becomes a guarantor or borrower under the ABL facility, subject to certain exceptions. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the ABL facility. The Senior Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture (the "Senior Notes Indenture") containing certain covenants that limit the Company's ability to, subject to certain exceptions, create, incur, or assume liens to secure debt, among other things. The Senior Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 
6.625

 of each year beginning on November 15, 2024. 
The Company may redeem the Senior Notes prior to May 15, 2027, with an amount equal to the net cash proceeds received by the Company from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 
106.625
% of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, in an aggregate principal amount for all such redemptions not to exceed 
40
% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes are subject to redemption at specified prices on or after May 15, 2027 plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such notes redeemed, to, but excluding, the applicable redemption date. In addition, at any time prior to May 15, 2027, the Company may, on one or more occasions, redeem the Senior Notes in whole or in part, at its option, upon notice, at a redemption price equal to 
100
% of the principal amount of such notes plus a “make-whole” premium as specified in the Senior Notes Indenture and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.
If the Company experiences certain change of control events, together with a ratings decline, as described in the Senior Notes Indenture, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase some or all of the Senior Notes at a price equal to 
101
% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.
The Senior Notes are subject to certain customary events of default and acceleration clauses. As of December 31, 2024, no such events have occurred.

Convertible Senior Notes due 2025
In August 2019, we issued $
350,000,000
 aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes that mature on February 15, 2025. The Convertible Notes bear interest at an annual rate of 
0.75
% payable semiannually, in arrears, on February 15
th
 and August 15
th
 of each year. The Convertible Notes are general unsecured obligations of Insight and are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Insight Direct USA, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Insight. 
Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding June 15, 2024, holders of the Convertible Notes could have converted their notes at their option at any time under certain circumstances. Beginning June 15, 2024 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the holders may convert their Convertible Notes at any time, regardless of such circumstances.

INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(continued)
The Convertible Notes mature on February 15, 2025 and we are required to settle the principal amount of the Convertible Notes in cash. As such, the Convertible Notes balance net of unamortized debt issuance costs is classified as a current liability.
 Upon conversion, we will pay cash equal to the principal amount of the Convertible Notes, plus shares of our common stock for any additional amounts due. The conversion rate will initially be 
14.6376
 shares of common stock per $
1,000
 principal amount of the Convertible Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $
68.32
 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to change in certain circumstances and will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.
As of December 31, 2024, the maximum number of shares issuable upon conversion, including the effect of a fundamental change and subject to other conversion rate adjustments, was 
6,460,532
.
In September 2023, an individual Convertible Note holder exercised their option to convert their Convertible Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $
16,895,000
, which was settled in January 2024. As a result, the principal amount of the Convertible Notes was settled in cash with additional amounts due being settled in shares of our common stock.
The Convertible Notes are subject to certain customary events of default and acceleration clauses. As of December 31, 2024, no such events have occurred.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(continued)
In January 2022, we filed an irrevocable settlement election notice with the note holders to inform them of our election to settle the principal amount of the Convertible Notes in cash.  
The remaining life of the debt issuance cost accretion is approximately 
0.13
 years. The effective interest rate on the principal of the Convertible Notes is 
0.75
%. 
Interest expense resulting from the Convertible Notes reported within the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is made up of contractual coupon interest and amortization of debt issuance costs.  
Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transaction
In connection and concurrent with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into certain convertible note hedge and warrant transactions (the "Call Spread Transactions") with respect to the Company’s common stock. 
The convertible note hedge consists of an option to purchase up to 
5,123,160
 common stock shares at a price of $
68.32
 per share. The hedge expires on February 15, 2025 and can only be concurrently executed upon the conversion of the Convertible Notes. We paid approximately $
66,325,000
 for the convertible note hedge transaction.
Additionally, we sold Warrants to purchase 
5,123,160
 shares of common stock at a price of $
103.12
 per share. The Warrants expire on May 15, 2025 and can only be exercised at maturity. The Company received aggregate proceeds of approximately $
34,440,000
 for the sale of the Warrants. See Note 21 for additional information about the planned settlement of a portion of the Warrants in cash.
The Call Spread Transactions have no effect on the terms of the Convertible Notes and reduce potential dilution by effectively increasing the initial conversion price of the Convertible Notes to $
103.12
 per share of the Company’s common stock.
Other Financing Obligations
From time to time, we enter into finance leases and other financing agreements with financial intermediaries to facilitate the purchase of products from certain vendors.
The current and long-term portions of our other financing obligations are included in the current and long-term portions of long-term debt in the table above and in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
(9)    
Leases 
We lease office space, distribution centers, land, vehicles and equipment. Lease agreements with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
Certain lease agreements include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from 
one
 to 
five years
 or more. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. Some agreements also include options to purchase the leased property. The estimated life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise.
Certain of our lease agreements include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

Company Plan
On April 3, 2020, our Board of Directors adopted and approved the new Insight Enterprises, Inc. 2020 Omnibus Plan (the “Plan”), subject to stockholder approval. The Plan was approved by our stockholders at our 2020 annual meeting on May 20, 2020 and unless sooner terminated, will remain in place until May 20, 2030.  The Plan allows the Company to grant options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, restricted stock, stock units (which may also be referred to as “restricted stock units” or "RSUs"), performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards and other awards payable in cash or shares of common stock to eligible non-employee directors, employees and consultants.  Consultants and independent contractors are eligible if they provide bona fide services that are not related to capital raising or promoting or maintaining a market for the Company’s stock. 
We grant service-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs to officers and certain employees under the Plan. RSUs generally vest over a 
two
 to 
three year
 vesting period, while 
79
INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(continued)
performance-based RSUs are also subject to the achievement of pre-established annual financial and/or strategic performance goals.  
Beginning in February 2022, we also granted performance-based RSUs based on a relative total shareholder return (“rTSR”) metric to officers and certain employees under the Plan. The number of rTSR performance-based RSUs expected to be received at vesting will range from 
0
% to 
200
% of target, based on the Company’s total shareholder return as compared to a group of peer companies over a 
three-year
 performance period. The Monte Carlo Simulation model is used to determine the fair value at grant date. 
In 2023, we granted performance-based RSUs to our officers and certain employees (the "INA Ambition" grant). The number of RSUs granted was based on an INA Adjusted EFO margin financial metric, some of which also have an Absolute TSR ("aTSR") multiplier applied to the number of shares granted. These performance-based RSUs will be received at vesting, and their amount will range from 
0
% to 
100
% of the target, with a multiplier of up to 
300
% applied to certain grants. The performance period for these grants is from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2024. Additionally, the performance-based RSUs based on the aTSR multiplier will vest 
50
% on the 
two-year
 anniversary of the grant, and the remaining 
50
% will vest on the 
three-year
 anniversary of the grant date. The INA Ambition grant performance measure was not attained and as a result none of the related awards vested.
The Company previously adopted the Amended Insight Enterprises, Inc. 2007 Omnibus Plan (the “Prior Plan”).  The Prior Plan was approved by our stockholders on May 18, 2011 at our 2011 annual meeting.  The Prior Plan shall remain in effect until all awards granted under the Prior Plan have been exercised, forfeited or cancelled or have otherwise expired or terminated. Any shares that remain outstanding or otherwise become available under the terms of the Prior Plan following the date the Plan is approved by the Company’s stockholders shall become available for issuance under the Plan. No further awards will be made under the Prior Plan.
The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of Insight’s Board of Directors, and, except as provided below, the Compensation Committee has the exclusive authority to administer the Plan, including the power to determine eligibility, the types of awards to be granted, the price and the timing of awards.  Under the Plan, the Compensation Committee may delegate some of its authority to our Chief Executive Officer to grant awards to individuals other than individuals who are subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  As of December 31, 2024, there are 
1,963,450
 shares of common stock available for grant under the Plan out of the 
2,931,075
 shares of common stock that were reserved and made available for grant under the Plan. 
Accounting for Restricted Stock Units
We issue RSUs as incentives to certain officers and teammates and as compensation to members of our Board of Directors.  We recognize compensation expense associated with the issuance of such RSUs over the vesting period for each respective RSU. The total compensation expense associated with service-based RSUs and performance based RSUs subject to financial metrics represent the value based upon the number of RSUs awarded multiplied by the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. The total compensation expense associated with RSUs subject to market based metrics, the grant date fair value was computed on the probable outcome of the performance conditions based on the Monte Carlo simulation and the grant date estimate of compensation cost to be recognized over the performance period. The number of RSUs to be awarded under our service-based RSUs is fixed at the grant date. The number of RSUs ultimately awarded under our performance-based RSUs varies based on whether the Company achieves certain financial or market based results. We record compensation expense each period based on our estimate of the most probable number of RSUs that will be issued under the grants of performance-based RSUs subject to financial metrics. Recipients of RSUs do not have voting or dividend rights until the vesting conditions are satisfied and shares are released.

During each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, the RSUs that vested for teammates in the United States were net-share settled such that we withheld shares with value equivalent up to the teammates’ maximum statutory United States tax obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes and remitted the equivalent cash amount to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld during 2024, 2023 and 2022 of 
65,972
, 
79,636
 and 
79,611
, respectively, were based on the value of the RSUs on their vesting dates as determined by our closing stock price on such dates. For 2024, 2023 and 2022, total payments for our teammates’ tax obligations to the taxing authorities were $
12,173,309
, $
10,659,000
 and $
7,905,000
, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity within the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. These net-share settlements had the effect of repurchases of our common stock as they reduced the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to us.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) is a broadly-based stock purchase plan in which any eligible employee may elect to participate by authorizing the Company to make payroll deductions in a designated percentage to pay the price of an option. In no event will the ESPP permit an employee to purchase common stock with a fair market value in excess of $
25,000
 in any calendar year. The first purchase under the ESPP was made on February 16, 2024, in accordance with the ESPP.

There are

-month offering periods in each calendar year beginning on February 18, May 18, August 18, and November 18, respectively. Purchases under the ESPP are made on the last trading day of each offering period. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, the purchase price of shares offered under the ESPP is an amount equal to 
95
% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of purchase. The ESPP is designed to comply with Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "IRC"), and thus is eligible for the favorable tax treatment afforded by Section 423.

As of December 31, 2024, we have accumulated undistributed earnings generated by our foreign subsidiaries, most of which have been taxed in the U.S. as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. For foreign subsidiary earnings not yet taxed under these provisions, we continue to assert permanent reinvestment of earnings earned in foreign jurisdictions which impose a withholding tax on dividends and, accordingly, have not accrued any additional income or withholding taxes on the potential repatriation of these earnings. At the present time, given the various complexities involved in repatriating earnings, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that may be payable if these earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.

As of December 31, 2024, we have U.S. state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) that will expire between 2025 and 2044, while the majority have no expiration date. Due to the uncertainty around future utilization, we have recorded a valuation allowance against the majority of these NOLs.
W
e have provided valuation allowances for certain of our deferred tax assets where we believe it is more likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, our valuation allowances totaled $
32,978,000
 and $
33,385,000
, respectively, relating primarily to foreign tax credits and NOLs. This decrease was primarily the result of tax attributes utilized during the year.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had approximately $
11,060,000
 and $
13,947,000
, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits. Of these amounts, approximately $
1,449,000
 and $
1,767,000
, respectively, related to accrued interest. The changes in the unrecognized tax benefits balance during the year reflect additions for tax positions taken in prior and current periods, net of reductions related to audit settlements and statute expirations. 
We are currently under audit in various jurisdictions for tax years 2017 through 2022. Although the timing of the resolutions and/or closures of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the examination phase of these audits may be concluded within the next 12 months which could increase or decrease the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits. However, based on the status of the various examinations in multiple jurisdictions, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made at this time, but the estimated effect on our income tax expense and net earnings is not expected to be significant.
In the U.S., federal income tax returns for years subsequent to 2021 remain open to examination. For state and foreign jurisdictions, the statute of limitations generally varies between three and ten years. However, to the extent allowable by law, the tax authorities may have a right to examine and make adjustment to prior periods when amended returns have been filed, or when net operating losses or tax credits were generated and carried forward for subsequent utilization.

Market Risk Management
Interest Rate Risk 
We have interest rate exposure arising from certain of our financing facilities, which have variable interest rates. These variable interest rates are affected by changes in short-term interest rates. We currently do not hedge our interest rate exposure. 
We do not believe that the effect of reasonably possible near-term changes in interest rates will be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our financing facilities expose our net earnings to changes in short-term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are variable. We had $
39,000,000
 outstanding under our ABL facility  and the interest rate attributable to the borrowings under our ABL facility was 
5.90
% per annum at December 31, 2024. The change in annual pre-tax earnings from operations resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in the interest rate would have been immaterial.
We had $
492,222,000
 outstanding under the Senior Notes and $
332,867,000
 outstanding under the Convertible Notes at December 31, 2024. The interest rate attributable to the borrowings under the Senior Notes and the Convertible Notes was 
6.625
% and 
0.75
%, respectively, per annum at December 31, 2024. Both the Senior Notes and the Convertible Notes are based on fixed rates and are currently not considered to have interest rate risk exposure. Although the Senior Notes and the Convertible Notes are based on fixed rates, changes in market interest rates could impact the fair market value of such notes. As of December 31, 2024, the fair market value of the Senior Notes was $
503,250,000
 and the fair market value of the Convertible Notes was $
751,926,285
. 
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
We have foreign currency exchange risk related to the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ operating results, assets and liabilities (see Note 1 for a description of our Foreign Currencies policy). We also maintain cash accounts denominated in currencies other than the functional currency, which expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Remeasurement of these cash balances results in gains/losses that are also reported in other (income) expense, net within non-operating expense (income), net. We monitor our foreign currency exposure and selectively enter into forward exchange contracts to mitigate risk associated with certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities related to foreign denominated payables, receivables and cash balances. Transaction gains and losses resulting from non-functional currency assets and liabilities are offset by gains and losses on forward contracts in non-operating expense (income), net in our consolidated statements of operations. The counterparties associated with our 
84
INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(continued)
foreign exchange forward contracts are large creditworthy commercial banks. The derivatives transacted with these institutions are short in duration and, therefore, we do not consider counterparty concentration and non-performance to be material risks. The Company does not have a significant concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty.
(13)    
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value measurements are determined based on the following three categories: 
Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.
As of December 31, 2024, we have no non-financial assets or liabilities that are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, and our other financial assets or liabilities generally consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, contract assets, long-term contract assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and long-term debt. The estimated fair values of our cash and cash equivalents approximate their carrying values and are determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The estimated fair values of our long-term debt balances, excluding the Senior Notes and the Convertible Notes, approximate their carrying values based on their variable interest rate terms that are based on current market interest rates for similar debt instruments. The fair market value of the Senior Notes and the Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2024 is disclosed in Note 12.  The fair values of the other financial assets and liabilities are based on the values that would be received or paid in an orderly transaction between market participants and approximate their carrying values due to their nature and/or short duration.
(14)    
Benefit Plans
We adopted a defined contribution benefit plan (the “Defined Contribution Plan”) for our U.S. teammates which complies with section 401(k) of the IRC. The Company provides a discretionary match to all participants who make 401(k) contributions pursuant to the Defined Contribution Plan. The discretionary match provided to participants is equivalent to 
50
% of a participant’s pre-tax contributions up to a maximum of 
6
% of eligible compensation per pay period. Additionally, we offer several defined contribution benefit plans to our teammates outside of the United States. These plans and their related terms vary by country. Total consolidated contribution expense under these plans was $
30,288,000
, $
28,341,000
 and $
27,827,000
 for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Share Repurchase Programs
On May 18, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $
300,000,000
 of our common stock, including $
100,000,000
 that remained available from prior authorizations. During 2024, this repurchase authorization was substantially exhausted. On September 11, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $
300,000,000
 of our common stock, in addition to any amount that remained from prior authorizations. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $
300,000,476
 remained available for repurchases under our share repurchase plan. Our share repurchases may be made on the open market, subject to Rule 10b-18 or in privately negotiated transactions, through block trades, through 10b5-1 plans or otherwise, at management’s discretion.  The number of shares purchased and the timing of the purchases will be based on market conditions, working capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors. We intend to retire the repurchased shares. 

The following table summarizes the shares of our common stock that we repurchased on the open market under these repurchase programs during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in thousands, except per share amounts:

Commitments and Contingencies
Contractual
In the ordinary course of business, we issue performance bonds to secure our performance under certain contracts or state tax requirements. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $
29,610,000
 of performance bonds outstanding. These bonds are issued on our behalf by a surety company on an unsecured basis; however, if the surety company is ever required to pay out under the bonds, we have contractually agreed to reimburse the surety company.
Management believes that payments, if any, related to these performance bonds are not probable at December 31, 2024. Accordingly, we have not accrued any liabilities related to such performance bonds in our consolidated financial statements. 
The Company has a minimum required purchase commitment of approximately $
100,467,000
 pursuant to an agreement primarily related to cloud services.  The total purchase commitment is required to be met or exceeded during a 
5
-year period, starting October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2028. At December 31, 2024 we had a remaining purchase commitment of $
78,859,000
. If total purchases do not meet the required commitment by September 30, 2028, the shortfall must be prepaid by the Company and can be used for further purchases through September 30, 2029.
The Company has a minimum required purchase commitment of approximately $
40,000,000
 pursuant to an agreement primarily related to software as a service.  The total purchase commitment is required to be met during a 
4
-year period, starting November 30, 2022 through November 29, 2026. At December 31, 2024 we had a remaining purchase commitment of $
26,123,000
.
The Company has recorded a contingent liability of approximately $
15,016,000
, payable to a partner to settle various contractual commitments to resell a minimum amount of cloud services to clients.   
Employment Contracts and Severance Plans
We have employment contracts with, and severance plans covering, certain officers and management teammates under which severance payments would become payable in the event of specified terminations without cause or terminations under certain circumstances after a change in control. In addition, vesting of outstanding nonvested RSUs would accelerate following a change in control. If severance payments under the current employment agreements or plan payments were to become payable, the severance payments would generally range from 
three
 to 
twenty-four months
 of salary.

Indemnifications
From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we agree to indemnify either our clients or third-party service providers from certain losses incurred relating to services performed on our behalf or for losses arising from defined events, which may include litigation or claims relating to past performance. These arrangements include, but are not limited to, the indemnification of our clients for certain claims arising out of our performance under our sales contracts, the indemnification of our landlords for certain claims arising from our use of leased facilities and the indemnification of the lenders that provide our credit facilities for certain claims arising from their extension of credit to us. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses.
Management believes that payments, if any, related to these indemnifications are not probable at December 31, 2024. Accordingly, we have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our consolidated financial statements.
We have entered into separate indemnification agreements with certain of our executive officers and with each of our directors. These agreements require us, among other requirements, to indemnify such officers and directors against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments and settlements incurred by such individual in connection with any action arising out of such individual’s status or service as our executive officer or director (subject to exceptions such as where the individual failed to act in good faith or in a manner the individual reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company) and to advance expenses incurred by such individual with respect to which such individual may be entitled to indemnification by us. There are no pending legal proceedings that involve the indemnification of any of the Company’s directors or officers.
Contingencies Related to Third-Party Review
From time to time, we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties. We are also subject to various governmental, client and partner audits. We continually assess whether or not such claims have merit and warrant accrual. Where appropriate, we accrue estimates of anticipated liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Such estimates are subject to change and may affect our results of operations and our cash flows. 
Legal Proceedings 
From time to time, we are party to various legal proceedings incidental to the business, including preference payment claims asserted in client bankruptcy proceedings, indemnification claims, claims of alleged infringement of patents, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, employment claims, claims related to services provided, interruptions, or outages, claims of alleged non-compliance with contract provisions and claims related to alleged violations of laws and regulations. We regularly evaluate the status of the legal proceedings in which we are involved to assess whether a loss is probable or there is a reasonable possibility that a loss, or an additional loss, may have been incurred and determine if accruals are required. If accruals are not required, we further evaluate each legal proceeding to assess whether an estimate of possible loss or range of possible loss can be made. Although litigation is inherently unpredictable, we believe that we have adequate provisions for any probable and estimable losses. It is possible, nevertheless, that our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in any particular period by the work required pursuant to any legal proceedings or the resolution of any legal proceedings during such period. Legal expenses related to defense of any legal proceeding or the negotiations, settlements, rulings and advice of outside legal counsel in connection with any legal proceedings are expensed as incurred.

90
INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.

(continued)
Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer, Joyce Mullen.
All significant intercompany transactions are eliminated upon consolidation, and there are no differences between the accounting policies used to measure profit and loss for our segments or on a consolidated basis. Net sales are defined as net sales to external clients. None of our clients exceeded ten percent of consolidated net sales in 2024, 2023 or 2022.
A portion of our operating segments’ selling and administrative expenses arise from shared services and infrastructure that we have historically provided to them in order to realize economies of scale and to use resources efficiently. These expenses, collectively identified as corporate charges, include senior management expenses, internal audit, legal, tax, insurance services, treasury and other corporate infrastructure expenses. Charges are allocated to our operating segments, and the allocations have been determined on a basis that we considered to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or benefits received by the operating segments.

Our CODM uses Adjusted earnings from operations when assessing the performance of and deciding how to allocate resources to the operating segments. For example, Adjusted earnings from operations is a basis for executive variable compensation. Significant selling and administrative expenses primarily reflect personnel costs, including teammate benefits. Our CODM uses an Adjusted measure of earnings from operations which excludes amortization of intangible assets, severance and restructuring expenses, acquisition and integration related expenses and

(continued)
certain other expenses. These other expenses include transformation costs, costs associated with third-party data center outages, net of recoveries, revaluation of earnout liabilities and other non-significant expenses. Our CODM uses comparisons of actual Adjusted earnings from operations against budget, forecasts and prior periods as a basis for assessing current period segment performance as well as for determining necessary resources to assign, including for determining necessary investments or reductions in resources.

Acquisitions
Infocenter
Effective May 1, 2024, we acquired 
100
 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Infocenter for a cash purchase price of $
265,000,000
, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired of $
5,103,000
, which is comprised of the initial purchase price of $
269,477,000
 paid in cash upon the acquisition and contractual adjustments to the purchase price of $
626,000
 paid in July 2024. The total purchase price of $
289,200,000
 also includes the estimated fair value of earn out payments of approximately $
24,200,000
, which provide an incentive opportunity for the sellers of up to $
106,250,000
, based on Infocenter achieving certain EBITDA performance through April 2026. Infocenter is a pure-play ServiceNow Elite Partner dedicated to automating business processes on the Now Platform®. We believe this acquisition enhances our Solutions Integrator offering framework to drive better business outcomes for our clients by enabling them to scale their multicloud environments with modern infrastructure, applications, and unified data and AI platforms.
The preliminary fair value of net assets acquired was approximately $
98,475,000
, including approximately $
123,900,000
 of identifiable intangible assets, consisting primarily of customer relationships that will be amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of 
ten years
. As these intangible assets are not tax deductible, we recognized a related deferred tax liability of approximately $
31,832,000
. The preliminary purchase price was allocated using the information currently available. Further information obtained upon the finalization of the fair value assumptions for identifiable intangible assets acquired and various accrued expense balance assessments could lead to an adjustment of the purchase price allocation. Goodwill acquired approximated $
190,725,000
, which was recorded in our North America operating segment.   
We consolidated the results of operations for Infocenter within our North America operating segment since its acquisition on May 1, 2024. Our historical results would not have been materially affected by the acquisition of Infocenter and, accordingly, we have not presented pro forma information as if the acquisition had been completed at the beginning of each period presented in our consolidated statement of operations.  
We recognized a net loss of $
18,800,000
 within selling and administrative expenses due to the net increase in the estimated fair value of the earnout payments in 2024.

SADA
Effective December 1, 2023, we acquired 
100
 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of SADA Systems, LLC (successor to SADA Systems, Inc. via conversion) ("SADA") for a preliminary cash purchase price of $
399,762,000
, excluding cash and cash equivalents acquired of $
24,701,000
. SADA is a leading cloud consultancy and technical services provider and six-time Google Cloud Partner of the Year, including cloud licensing and professional services to small, mid-sized and corporate/enterprise commercial clients, state and federal governments and educational institutions across North America, Europe and Asia. Based in Los Angeles, California, SADA has 
three
 office locations in North America, India and Armenia with more than 
700
 teammates. We believe that this acquisition advances our strategy and further strengthens our unique position as a leading Solutions Integrator offering market-leading multicloud solutions at scale. SADA's partnership with Google Cloud will enhance our ability to serve clients who operate across multiple clouds and accelerate adoption of widely sought-after technologies like Generative Artificial Intelligence. SADA is being reported as a part of our North America operating segment.
The total purchase price of $
426,050,000
, which is net of cash and cash equivalents acquired of $
24,701,000
, is comprised of the initial purchase price of $
423,290,000
 paid in cash upon the SADA acquisition, contractual adjustments to the purchase price of $
1,173,000
 and a seller retention fund of $
5,000,000
 payable post-closing. The purchase price also includes the estimated fair value of earn out payments of approximately $
21,288,000
, which provides an incentive opportunity for the sellers of up to $
390,000,000
, based on the SADA business achieving EBITDA and revenue growth performance through 2026. A portion of the purchase price was used to settle SADA’s stock-based compensation liabilities of $
68,335,000
 and pay SADA’s transaction costs of approximately $
16,852,000
 at acquisition in accordance with purchase agreement.

Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price as shown in the table above was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.  
The estimated fair values of the majority of the current assets and liabilities are based upon their historical costs on the date of acquisition due to their short-term nature, with the exception of contract assets. The estimated fair value of the property and equipment are also based upon historical costs as they approximate fair value. The contract assets are an exception to the fair value model and are evaluated under relevant revenue recognition guidance including an allowance for credit losses using the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model.
The estimated fair value of net assets acquired was approximately $
290,218,000
, including $
158,100,000
 of identifiable intangible assets, consisting primarily of customer relationships of $
124,700,000
 and non-compete agreements of $
26,200,000
. The fair values were 
95

determined using the multiple-period excess earnings method and the lost income method, respectively.

Goodwill of $
135,832,000
, which was recorded in our North America operating segment, represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from SADA. The goodwill is not amortized and will be tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. The addition of the SADA technical employees to our team and the opportunity to grow our business are the primary factors making up the goodwill recognized as part of the transaction. The purchase price allocation was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2024 with a net increase of $
18,810,000
 in goodwill during the measurement period, primarily due to certain measurement period adjustments to contract assets, net, accounts payable and accrued expenses.
The intangible assets and goodwill are tax deductible as the transaction is a deemed asset acquisition for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the seller parties undertook an internal restructuring pursuant to Section 368(a)(1)(F) of the IRC.
We recognized a net gain of $
20,219,000
 within selling and administrative expenses due to the net decrease in the estimated fair value of the earnout payments in 2024.
We have consolidated the results of operations for SADA since its acquisition on December 1, 2023. Consolidated net sales and net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023 include $
33,451,000
 and $
14,502,000
, respectively, from SADA. Due to seasonality in SADA's business, with the majority of net sales and net earnings historically being generated in the second half of the year, these results should not be considered indicative of future results.

The pro forma results primarily include the adjustments to reflect the additional amortization of acquired intangible assets and interest expense on the additional borrowing under the ABL revolving credit facility, removal of acquisition-related costs, and the consequential tax effects of the pro forma adjustments and SADA tax status change.
SADA’s stock-based compensation plans were fully vested and settled upon acquisition based on a pre-existing change-in-control provision within the plan terms. Due to

changes in the estimated fair value of awards, SADA recognized a stock-based compensation gain of $
100,206,000
 and $
32,051,000
 in its historical statements of operation for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These gains are reflected in the unaudited pro forma earnings above. As these plans were not replaced post-acquisition, there will be no future impact of SADA’s stock-based compensation plans on the Company.
This unaudited pro forma financial information is for informational purposes only. It is neither indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved had the acquisition been consummated at the beginning of 2022, nor is it necessarily indicative of future results.
Amdaris
Effective August 17, 2023, we acquired 
100
 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of Amdaris Group Limited (“Amdaris”) for a cash purchase price, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, of approximately $
82,875,000
, excluding the estimated fair value of an earn out, reported in other liabilities, with a range of payouts through 2026 of $
0
 to $
54,391,000
.  We paid the earnout of $
14,348,000
 for Amdaris' 2023 performance in March 2024. Amdaris, an award-winning software development and digital services specialist, provides innovative software development, application support, managed services and consultancy services to the customers in the United Kingdom with service delivery centers located in several eastern European countries. Amdaris has been recognized as a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner.  We believe this acquisition expands our global Modern Apps and Data & AI areas of solutions expertise as a leading solutions integrator and enhances our technological capabilities and scale to deliver an even broader range of customized services and solutions to clients in EMEA. 
The fair value of net assets acquired was approximately $
34,060,000
, including $
41,291,000
 of identifiable intangible assets, consisting primarily of customer relationships that will be amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of 
ten years
.  The preliminary purchase price was allocated using the information currently available. During the first quarter of 2024, we finalized the fair value assumptions for identifiable intangible assets with no changes being made to amounts previously recorded. Goodwill acquired approximated $
71,698,000
,

which was recorded in our EMEA operating segment.  
We consolidated the results of operations for Amdaris within our EMEA operating segment beginning on August 17, 2023, the effective date of the acquisition. Our historical results would not have been materially affected by the acquisition of Amdaris and, accordingly, we have not presented pro forma information as if the acquisition had been completed at the beginning of each period presented in our consolidated statement of operations.  

We recognized net gain of $
6,430,000
 within selling and administrative expenses due to the net decrease in the estimated fair value of the earnout payments in 2024.

Subsequent Events
On January 6, 2025, the Company entered into an agreement to settle 
2,049,264
 of the total 
5,123,160
 Warrants. The Warrants will be settled entirely in cash, based upon an agreed upon settlement amount that will be calculated using up to a thirty five trading day settlement period. We recorded a liability of approximately $
112,590,000
 upon execution of the agreement. Any change in the fair value of the settlement liability through the settlement date will be recognized in net income. We expect final settlement to occur in February or March 2025.

Controls and Procedures
(a)
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)). Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria established in 
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Management has concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the criteria established in COSO’s Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). 
KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.
(b)
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
(c)
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as of the end of the period covered by this report, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and determined that as of December 31, 2024 our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   
(d)
Inherent Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
