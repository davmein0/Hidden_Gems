References to "the Company," “Insight,” “we,” “us,” “our” and other similar words refer to Insight Enterprises, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context suggests otherwise. Certain statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including statements in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of this report, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may include: projections of, and matters that affect, net sales, gross profit, gross margin, operating expenses, earnings from operations, non-operating income and expenses, net earnings or cash flows, cash needs and the payment of accrued expenses and liabilities; our expectations regarding supply constraints, including our belief that remaining supply constraints have normalized back to near historic levels; our belief that the general slowdown in our clients' decision making will continue in the short term; our expectations regarding certain trends for our business
, including that lower sales of devices and infrastructure could continue into 2025 and that gross margin expansion could continue into future periods as we focus on selling solutions and increasing our services net sales
; our expectation that transformation costs are not expected to recur in the longer term; the expected effects of seasonality on our business, including as a result of recent acquisitions; expectations of further consolidation and trends in the Information Technology (“IT”) industry; our business strategy and our strategic initiatives, including our efforts to grow our core business in the current environment, develop and grow our global cloud business and build scalable solutions; expectations regarding the impact of partner incentives and changes to partner incentive programs, including our belief that we may not experience significant growth in cloud gross profit in 2025 compared to 2024 as a result of certain partner program changes; our expectations about future benefits of our acquisitions and our plans related thereto, including potential expansion into wider regions; the increasing demand for big data solutions; the availability of competitive sources of products for our purchase and resale; our intentions concerning the payment of dividends; our acquisition strategy and our expectation that we will incur additional acquisition expenses in executing such strategy; our expectations regarding the impact of inflation, including our expectation that while interest rates will eventually decrease, we anticipate higher than historical interest rates will continue throughout most of 2025, and our ability to offset the effects of inflation and manage any increase in interest rates; projections of capital expenditures; our plans to continue to evolve our IT systems; our expectation that our gross margins will improve as our mix of services and solutions increase; plans relating to share repurchases; our liquidity and the sufficiency of our capital resources, the availability of financing and our needs or plans relating thereto; our expectation that we have sufficient funds available from capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facility (the “ABL facility”), as well as cash we expect to generate from operations, to fund the settlement upon maturity of our convertible senior notes (the "Convertible Notes"); the effects of new accounting principles and expected dates of adoption; the effect of indemnification obligations; projections about the outcome of ongoing tax audits; our expectations regarding future tax rates and the impact of domestic and global tax legislation, including our expectation that our effective tax rate will return to more typical levels in the foreseeable future; adequate provisions for and our positions and strategies with respect to ongoing and threatened litigation and expected outcomes; our ability to expand our client relationships; our expectations that pricing pressures in the IT industry will continue; our intention to use cash generated in 2025 in excess of working capital needs to pay down our ABL facility and inventory financing facilities, to settle a portion of the warrants (the “Warrants”) relating to the Call Spread Transactions (as defined below) in cash, and for strategic acquisitions; our expectation that the planned cash settlement of a portion of the Warrants will occur in February or March 2025; our belief that our office facilities are adequate and that we will be able to extend our current leases or locate substitute facilities on satisfactory terms; our belief that we have adequate provisions for losses; our expectation that we will not incur interest payments under our inventory financing facilities; our expectations that future income will be sufficient to fully recover deferred tax assets; our exposure to off-balance sheet arrangements; statements of belief; and statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements are identified by such words as “believe,” “anticipate,” “expect,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “will,” “may” and variations of such words and similar expressions and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified.
