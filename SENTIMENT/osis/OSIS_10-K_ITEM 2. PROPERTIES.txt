This is comprised of multiple leases at the same or nearby facilities.
We believe that our facilities are in adequate condition to support our current operations but expect to expand as necessary to support our anticipated future growth. We currently anticipate that we will be able to renew the leases that are scheduled to expire in the next few years on terms that are substantially the same as those currently in effect. However, even if we were not able to renew one or more of the leases, we believe that suitable substitute space is available to relocate any of the facilities. Accordingly, we do not believe that our failure to renew any of the leases that are scheduled to expire in the next few years will have a material adverse effect on our operations.
