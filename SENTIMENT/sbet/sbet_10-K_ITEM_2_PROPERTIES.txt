ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

At the beginning of 2024, the Company leased certain office space at 333 Washington Avenue North, Suite 104, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55401, USA under a long-term, non-cancelable operating lease agreement. The contract provided the right to substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the office space and the right to direct the use of the office space. The agreement also required the Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance and repairs during the lease. After the consummation of the Sale of Business in January 2024, the Company is required to pay RSports a monthly amount for shared lease space at the same address at $1,000 per month. This lease is on a month-to-month basis and can be terminated upon notice to RSports prior to the next monthly payment. The Company terminated this lease arrangement on December 31, 2024.
