PART I

This Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), or the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements are based on our management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management and involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions, which are subject to change at any time at our discretion. Forward-looking statements include our assessment, from time to time of our competitive position, the industry environment, potential growth opportunities, the effects of regulation and events outside of our control, such as natural disasters, wars or health epidemics. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by terms such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,” “hopes,” “intends,” “may,” “plans,” “potential,” “predicts,” “projects,” “should,” “will,” “would” or similar expressions.

Forward-looking statements are merely predictions and therefore inherently subject to uncertainties and other factors which could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statement. These uncertainties and other factors include, among other things:

●

our ability to remain a market innovator, to create new market opportunities, and/or to expand into new markets;

●

the potential need for changes in our long-term strategy in response to future developments;

●

our ability to attract and retain skilled employees;

●

our ability to raise sufficient capital to support our operations and fund our growth initiatives;

●

unexpected changes in significant operating expenses;

●

changes in the supply, demand and/or prices for our products and services;

●

increased competition, including from companies which may have substantially greater resources than we have;

●

the impact of potential security and cyber threats or the risk of unauthorized access to our, our customers’ and/or our business partners’ information and systems;

●

changes in the regulatory environment and the consequences to our financial position, business and reputation that could result from failing to comply with such regulatory requirements;

●

our ability to continue to successfully integrate acquired companies into our operations;

●

our ability to respond and adapt to unexpected legal, regulatory and government budgetary changes, and other business restrictions affecting our ability to market our products and services;

●

varying attitudes towards sports and online casino games and poker (“iGaming”) data providers and betting by foreign governments;

●

failure to develop or integrate new technology into current products and services;

unfavorable results in legal proceedings to which we may be subject;

●

failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; and

●

general economic and business conditions in the United States and elsewhere in the world, including the impact of inflation.

Set forth below in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” are additional significant uncertainties and other factors affecting forward-looking statements. The reader should understand that the uncertainties and other factors identified in this Annual Report are not a comprehensive list of all the uncertainties and other factors that may affect forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or the list of uncertainties and other factors that could affect those statements.
