ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Overview

Headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, SharpLink Gaming is an online performance-based marketing company that leverages our unique fan activation solutions to generate and deliver high quality leads to our U.S. sportsbook and global casino gaming partners.

In December 2023, the Company discontinued investments into and operation of its C4 sports betting conversion technology (“C4”) due to the lack of market acceptance. C4 centered on cost effectively monetizing our own proprietary audiences and our customers’ audiences of U.S. fantasy sports and casual sports fans and casino gaming enthusiasts by converting them into loyal online sports and iGaming bettors.

Continuing Operations

In December 2021, SharpLink acquired certain assets of FourCubed, including FourCubed’s online casino gaming-focused affiliate marketing network, known as PAS.net (“PAS”). For more than 18 years, PAS has focused on delivering quality traffic and player acquisitions, retention and conversions to regulated and global casino gaming operator partners worldwide. In fact, PAS won industry recognition as the European online gambling industry’s Top Affiliate Manager, Top Affiliate Website and Top Affiliate Program for four consecutive years by both igambingbusiness.com and igamingaffiliate.com. The strategic acquisition of FourCubed brought SharpLink talent with proven experience in affiliate marketing services and recurring net gaming revenue (“NGR”) contracts with many of the world’s leading online casino gambling companies, including Party Poker, bwin, UNIBET, GG Poker, 888 poker, betfair, WPT Global and others.

As part of our strategy to expand our affiliate marketing services to the emerging American sports betting market, in November 2022, we began a systematic roll-out of our U.S.-focused performance-based marketing business with the launch of 15 state-specific, content-rich affiliate marketing websites. Our user-friendly, state-specific domains are designed to attract, acquire and drive local sports betting and casino traffic directly to our sportsbook and casino partners’ which are licensed to operate in each respective state. As of March 15, 2025, we are licensed to operate in 18 jurisdictions and own and operate sites serving 17 U.S. states (Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming). As more states legalize sports betting, our portfolio of state-specific affiliate marketing properties may expand to include them. We largely utilize search engine optimization and programmatic advertising campaigns to drive traffic to our direct-to-player (“D2P”) sites.

In the first quarter of 2023, we unveiled SharpBetting.com, a U.S. sports betting education hub for experienced and novice sports fans. SharpBetting.com is a robust educational website dedicated to teaching new sports betting enthusiasts the fundamentals of, and winning strategies for, navigating the legal sports betting landscape responsibly.

Today, our vision is to power a targeted and personalized online sports betting and casino gaming environment that organically introduces fans to our operator partners through relevant tools and rich content – all in a safe, credible and responsible environment.

During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, our continuing operations generated revenues of $3,662,349 and $4,952,725 respectively, representing a decrease of 26.1% on a comparative year-over-year basis.

Discontinued Operations

SharpLink’s business-building platform also included the provision of Free-To-Play (“F2P”) sports game and mobile app development services to a marquis list of customers, which included several of the biggest names in sports and sports betting, including Turner Sports, NBA, NFL, PGA TOUR, NASCAR and BetMGM, among others. In addition, we previously owned and operated a variety of proprietary real-money fantasy sports and sports simulation games and mobile apps through our SportsHub/fantasy sports business unit, which also owned and operated LeagueSafe, one of the fantasy sports industry’s most trusted sources for collecting and protecting private fantasy league dues.

On January 18, 2024, SharpLink sold all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock or membership interests, as applicable, in our Sports Gaming Client Services and SportsHub Gaming Network business units to RSports Interactive, Inc. (“RSports”) for $22.5 million in an all-cash transaction (the “Sale of Business”), pursuant to the signing of a Purchase Agreement and other related agreements. Nearly all of the employees of these acquired business units also moved to RSports to help ensure a seamless transaction.

The historical results of our Sports Gaming Client Services and SportsHub Gaming Network businesses have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods prior to the Sale of Business. See NOTE 3 included in the NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2024 AND 2023.

Organizational History

Go-Public Merger with Mer Telemanagement Solutions Ltd.

Formerly known as Mer Telemanagement Solutions Ltd. (“MTS”), the Company was incorporated as a public limited liability company under the laws of the State of Israel in December 1995. In July 2021, MTS completed a merger between New SL Acquisition Corp., its wholly owned subsidiary, and SharpLink, Inc. (the “MTS Merger”). In the MTS Merger, SharpLink, Inc. was treated as the acquirer for accounting purposes because, among other reasons, its pre-merger shareholders held a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company immediately following the merger. After the merger, the Company changed its name from Mer Telemanagement Solutions Ltd. to SharpLink Gaming Ltd. (“SharpLink Israel”) and its Nasdaq ticker symbol from MTSL to SBET.

FourCubed Acquisition

On December 31, 2021, in a combination cash and stock transaction, we acquired certain assets of 6t4 Company, a Minnesota corporation, and FourCubed Management, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (collectively “FourCubed”), including FourCubed’s iGaming and affiliate marketing network, known as PAS.net. For more than 19 years, FourCubed has provided its global iGaming operating partners with affiliate marketing services. The strategic acquisition of FourCubed brought SharpLink an industry respected operating team with decades of combined experience in conversion through affiliate marketing services and in securing highly profitable, recurring net gaming revenue contracts with many of the world’s leading iGaming companies, including Party Poker, bwin, UNIBET, GG Poker, 888 poker, betfair, WPT Global and others. Originally established in 2005, FourCubed’s international iGaming affiliate network, Poker Affiliate Solutions (“PAS”), is currently comprised of over 12,400 sub-affiliates and has delivered over 2.5 million referred players since it was launched in 2008 at www.pas.net.

Merger with SportsHub Games Network Inc. (the 
“
SportsHub Merger
”
)

SharpLink Israel, SHGN Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of SharpLink Israel (“Merger Subsidiary”), SportsHub Games Network Inc. (“SportsHub”) and Christian Peterson, an individual acting as the SportsHub stockholders’ representative entered into a Merger Agreement on September 7, 2022. The Merger Agreement, as amended, contained the terms and conditions of the proposed business combination of SharpLink Israel and SportsHub. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as amended, on December 22, 2022, SportsHub merged with and into Merger Subsidiary with Merger Subsidiary surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of SharpLink Israel. In association with the transaction, SharpLink Israel issued, in the aggregate, 431,926 ordinary shares to common and preferred stockholders of SportsHub, on a fully diluted basis. An additional aggregate of 40,585 ordinary shares were held in escrow for SportsHub shareholders who had not yet provided the applicable documentation required in connection with the SportsHub Merger, as well as shares held in escrow for indemnifiable losses and for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representative in performing his duties pursuant to the Merger Agreement. On December 28, 2023, the escrow shares were disbursed to the SportsHub shareholders in accordance with the Merger Agreement.

Sale of Legacy MTS Business

On December 31, 2022, SharpLink Israel closed on the sale of its legacy MTS business (“Legacy MTS”) to Israel-based Entrypoint South Ltd., a subsidiary of Entrypoint Systems 2004 Ltd. In consideration of Entrypoint South Ltd. acquiring all rights, title, interests and benefits to Legacy MTS, including 100% of the shares of MTS Integratrak Inc., one of the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries, Entrypoint South Ltd. will pay SharpLink an earn-out payment (an “Earn-Out Payment”) equal to three times Legacy MTS’ Earnings Before Interest, Taxes Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) for the year ending December 31, 2023, up to a maximum earn-out payment of $1 million (adjusted to reflect net working capital as of the closing date). Within ten (10) calendar days of the approval by the board of directors of the Buyer of the audited annual financial statements of the Business as at December 31, 2023, and for the 12-month period ending on such date (as applicable, the “Earn-Out Schedule Delivery Date”), which shall occur no later than May 31, 2024, Buyer shall deliver to the Seller a schedule certified by its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (an “Earn-Out Schedule”) setting forth the computation of the Earn-Out Payment (as applicable), if any, together with the calculation thereof in an agreed Excel table format (including, but not limiting to all relevant details of the EBITDA calculations for the year 2023). In July 2024, SharpLink received an earnout payment of $297,387.

Change from Foreign Private Issuer to Domestic Issuer

Prior to January 1, 2023, SharpLink Israel qualified as a foreign private issuer. There are two tests to determine whether a foreign company qualifies as a foreign private issuer: the U.S. shareholder test and U.S. business contacts test. Under the U.S. shareholder test, a foreign company will qualify as a foreign private issuer if 50% or less of its outstanding voting securities are held by U.S. residents. If a foreign company fails this shareholder test, it will still be considered a foreign private issuer unless it fails any one part of the U.S. business contacts test. The U.S. business contacts test includes the following three parts: 1) the majority of the company’s executive officers or directors are U.S. citizens or residents; 2) more than 50% of the issuer’s assets are located in the United States; or 3) the issuer’s business is administered principally in the United States. Because we failed these tests, we ceased being a foreign private issuer and effective January 1, 2023, we began complying with the reporting requirements under the rules and regulations of the Exchange Act, applicable to U.S. domestic companies.

Change in Share Capital

On October 24, 2023, SharpLink Israel held an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (the “Meeting”) at which shareholders approved the adoption of an amendment to SharpLink Israel’s amended and restated articles of association to increase authorized share capital of SharpLink Israel from 9,290,000 ordinary shares, nominal value NIS 0.60 per share, to 100,000,000 ordinary shares, nominal value NIS 0.60 per share, and a corresponding amendment to SharpLink Israel’s memorandum of association.

Potential Reverse Stock-Split

On November 5, 2024, SharpLink Gaming, Inc.'s Board of Directors unanimously adopted resolutions approving, declaring advisable and recommending to the stockholders for their approval a proposal to authorize the Board of Directors, in its discretion, to amend our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding Common Stock at a ratio of up to and including 6:1, such ratio to be determined by the Board of Directors, including any increase in our authorized capital required in the event a fractional share will be created as a result of the reverse stock split. On December 23, 2024 at SharpLink's Annual General Meeting of Stockholders, stockholders approved the reverse stock split, granting the Board of Directors the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to carry out such action, with the exact exchange ratio and timing to be determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may determine in its discretion not to effect the reverse stock split and not to file any amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.  The primary purpose for effecting the reverse stock split, should the Board of Directors choose to effect one, would be to increase the per share price of SharpLink's Common Stock to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). 

On July 17, 2024, the Company received a letter (the "Bid Price Deficiency Notice”) from Nasdaq notifying the Company that, because the closing bid price for its common stock had been below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, it was not compliant with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. In accordance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company had a period of 180 calendar days, or until January 7, 2025, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If at any time before January 7, 2025, the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock closed at or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days (which number days may be extended by Nasdaq), Nasdaq would provide written notification that the Company had achieved compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and the matter would be resolved.

   On January 8, 2025, SharpLink received a letter (the "Notice") from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq (the "Staff") indicating the Company's continued non-compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) (the "Bid Price Rule"). The Notice from the Staff informed the Company that the Staff had determined that the Company has not regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and was not eligible for a second 180-day compliance period, due to the Company’s previously reported failure to comply with the $5,000,000 minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market as required under Listing Rule 5505(b)(1). SharpLink is working to evidence compliance with Minimum Bid Price Requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and intends to submit a plan to that effect to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the "Panel”) as part of the hearing process, which is expected to include plans to effect the reverse stock split. However, there can be no assurance the Panel will grant any request for continued listing or that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the applicable listing criteria within the period of time that may be granted by the Panel even in the event that the Company's Board elects to effect a reverse stock split of its share capital. See NOTE 18 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS included in the NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Sale of Sports Gaming Client Services and SportsHub Gaming Network Operating Segments

On January 18, 2024, SharpLink Israel (“Parent Seller”) and SLG1 Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of SharpLink (“Subsidiary Seller”), SHGN Acquisition Corp. (“SHGN”) and together with Parent Seller and Subsidiary Seller, the (“Seller”), a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of SharpLink, entered into a Purchase Agreement (the “PA”) with RSports Interactive, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (“Buyer”). The Subsidiary Seller owned all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Sports Technologies, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company, SHGN and Holdings Quinn, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (collectively referred to as the “Targets”). The PA contemplated the sale of the Company’s Sports Gaming Client Services and SportsHub Gaming Network business units to the Buyer, by selling all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock or membership interests of the Targets and the Acquired Subsidiaries for $22,500,000 in an all cash transaction.

On May 8, 2024, SharpLink entered into an amended and fully restated Post Closing Assignment Agreement with RSports, whereby SharpLink and RSports have agreed to amend the PA to exclude the transfer/sale of SHGN and have agreed to the assignment/sale of the Acquired Subsidiaries membership interests in SHReserve and SHPA to be made directly to RSports upon and subsequent to the approval of a petition by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. Based on this amended agreement, the sale of the business is an asset sale for legal and tax purposes instead of an equity sale.

Further, in connection with the Sale of Business, SharpLink entered into a Post Closing Covenant Agreement (the “PCCA”) with the Buyer defining the post-closing terms and conditions relating to certain transfers and assignments of assets subsequent to the closing of the Sale of Business, including:

●

Transferring control of all bank accounts held by the Targets to the Buyer;

●

Transferring or cooperating with the application process for all state gaming licenses held by the Targets in connection with the change of control to the Buyer;

●

Providing the Buyer with an accounting of all funds due to and from and any deferred revenue between Sports Technologies, LLC, SHGN and SharpLink, Inc.;

●

Assigning to Buyer or its affiliates, or cause the counterparty to consent to, all contracts assumed by the Buyer or its affiliates on or subsequent to the closing based upon change of control provisions; and

●

Assigning to Buyer or its affiliates all of its intellectual property rights purchased in the PA for the Acquired Subsidiaries or Targets.

In accordance with the terms of the PCCA, SharpLink will complete all post-closing covenants following the closing as reasonably possible, with the exception of Seller covenants that are dependent on governmental authorities or governmental orders for completion, in which case it will use diligent, good faith efforts to cause the same to be completed as soon as practical. The $14.6 million gain was calculated by measuring the difference between the fair value of consideration received less the carrying amount of assets and liabilities sold in accordance with ASC 
810.

In the statement of cashflows for the year ended December 31, 2024, the net cash used in investing activities - discontinued operations is due to cash received from the sale of business of $22,500,000, net of the cash transferred of $41,357,834. The majority of the cash transferred of $41,357,834 was reflected in discontinued operations customer deposits liability and deferred revenue of $36,959,573 and $4,888,704, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, SharpLink paid RSports $157,857, respectively, for use of accounting service personnel under the PCCA agreement. RSports paid SharpLink $89,940 under the PCCA agreement for the same period.

Nasdaq Notice

2023 Continued Listing Deficiencies

On May 23, 2023, SharpLink received a notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) stating that SharpLink did not comply with the equity standard for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Rule”) requires listed companies to maintain stockholders’ equity of at least $2.5 million under the net equity standard. As of the SharpLink Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, SharpLink reported total stockholders’ deficit of $4,463,917. SharpLink did not meet the alternative standards for market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations, thus SharpLink was not in compliance with Nasdaq’s Listing Rule.  As reported on a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 12, 2023, SharpLink submitted a hearing request with the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) on November 28, 2023, relating to the Staff’s determination to delist the Company’s securities from Nasdaq due to the Company’s failure to meet the minimum $2.5 million shareholders’ equity requirement for continued listing as defined by the Rule. On November 28, 2023, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that an oral hearing (the “Hearing”) had been scheduled for February 20, 2024; and, the delisting action referenced in the Staff’s determination letter, dated November 21, 2023, had been stayed, pending a final determination by the Panel.  On January 24, 2024, SharpLink filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC, disclosing details of the sale of its Sports Gaming Client Services and SportsHub Gaming Network business units to RSports Interactive, Inc. for $22.5 million in an all-cash transaction (the “Sale of Business”). As a result of the Sale of Business, the Company’s total stockholders’ equity exceeded $2.5 million as of the date of the above referenced Form 8-K filing. As a result of the Sale of Business, the Company believed that it had regained compliance with all applicable continued listing requirements and had requested that the Staff determine whether the Hearing should be cancelled.  On February 7, 2024, SharpLink received formal notification from Nasdaq that the Company’s previously announced deficiency under the Rule had been cured, and the Company had regained compliance with all applicable continued listing standards. Therefore, the Hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel, originally scheduled for February 20, 2024, was cancelled.

2024 Continued Listing Deficiencies

As previously announced in a press release, dated July 17, 2024, and reported on Form 10-Q filed by the Company on August 15, 2024, the Company received a letter on July 17, 2024, from Nasdaq notifying the Company that, because the closing bid price for its Common Stock had been below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, it was not compliant with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement (the "Bid Price Deficiency Notice”). In accordance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company had a period of 180 calendar days, or until January 7, 2025, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. Further, as previously reported on our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 22, 2024, the Nasdaq Staff notified the Company that it did not comply with the $2.5 million minimum stockholders’ equity requirement, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).  The Company had 45 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance or until January 6, 2025. On January 8, 2025, SharpLink received a letter (the "Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq indicating the Company’s continued non-compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) (the "Bid Price Rule”). The Notice from the Staff informed the Company that the Staff had determined that the Company has not regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and was not eligible for a second 180-day compliance period, due to the Company’s previously reported failure to comply with the $5,000,000 minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market as required under Listing Rule 5505(b)(1).  The Company’s had a hearing with the Nasdaq Hearing Panel on February 25, 2025. The Company’s Common Stock will remain listed and eligible for trading on Nasdaq pending the ultimate conclusion of the hearing process.  SharpLink is working to evidence compliance with both the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and Minimum Stockholder’s Equity Requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and intends to submit a plan to that effect to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the "Panel”) as part of the hearing process; however, there can be no assurance the Panel will grant any request for continued listing or that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the applicable listing criteria within the period of time that may be granted by the Panel.

Operating Segments

We operate in one reportable segment, Affiliate Marketing Services.

Affiliate Marketing Services 

On December 31, 2021, in a combination of cash and stock transaction, SharpLink acquired certain assets of FourCubed, including FourCubed’s iGaming and affiliate marketing network, known as PAS.net (“PAS”). For more than 18 years, PAS has focused on delivering quality traffic and player acquisitions, retention and conversions to U.S. regulated and global iGaming operator partners worldwide. In fact, PAS won industry recognition as the European online gambling industry’s Top Affiliate Manager, Top Affiliate Website and Top Affiliate Program for four consecutive years by both igambingbusiness.com and igamingaffiliate.com. The strategic acquisition of FourCubed brought SharpLink an industry respected operating team with decades of combined experience in conversion through affiliate marketing services and in securing recurring net gaming revenue (“NGR”) contracts with many of the world’s leading iGaming companies, including Party Poker, bwin, UNIBET, GG Poker, 888 poker, betfair and World Poker Tour (WPT Global), among others.

The PAS affiliate network is comprised of more than 12,400 referred sub-affiliates and has delivered over 2.5 million referred players since the network’s launch in 2008.

As part of our strategy to deliver unique fan activation solutions to our sportsbook and casino partners, in November 2022, we executed the first phase of a planned multi-phase roll-out of our U.S.-focused direct to player (“D2P”) business with the launch of state-specific affiliate marketing websites. These state-specific domains are designed to attract, acquire and drive local sports betting and casino traffic directly to the Company’s sportsbook and casino partners’ which are licensed to operate in each respective state. As of March ﻿15
, 2025, we are licensed to operate in 18 jurisdictions and own and operate D2P sites serving 17 U.S. states.

Specifically, the following proprietary affiliate marketing web properties are in operation:

In addition, four of the 17 state sites – Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia where iGaming has been legalized – feature similar content relating directly to SharpLink’s online casino partners. As more states legalize sports betting, our portfolio of state-specific affiliate marketing properties may expand to include them. We largely utilize search engine optimization and programmatic advertising campaigns to drive traffic to our D2P sites.

In the first quarter of 2023, we announced that in connection with our national audience aggregation and phased D2P revenue growth initiatives, phase two of our plan was implemented when we launched SharpBetting.com, a sports betting education hub for experienced and novice sports fans. SharpBetting.com is a robust educational website dedicated to teaching new sports betting enthusiasts the fundamentals of, and winning strategies for, navigating the legal sports betting landscape.

Affiliate Marketing Services Revenue Models

SharpLink generates revenue from our Affiliate Marketing Services segments by earning a commission from sportsbooks and casino operators on new depositors directed to them via our PAS affiliate marketing network in international markets and from our proprietary D2P websites in U.S. jurisdictions. Depending on the terms of our marketing agreement with each operator and the type of license SharpLink has been granted in a particular state by its regulator, commissions may be paid in the form of cost per acquisition (“CPA”) or by sharing in Net Gaming Revenues ("NGR") generated by the referred depositor.

Market Opportunity

Search for odds or lines on any given match-up, and the vast majority of search results will spring from affiliate marketing sites. Affiliates play a critical role in the online sports betting and casino gaming ecosystems, especially in newly regulated states in the United States.

The affiliate market has a long history of operating in tandem with sports betting, reaching back to much-more-mature markets like the United Kingdom and countries throughout Europe – or even beyond locally regulated online betting – and into the early annals of U.S. sports betting upon the 2018 repeal of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (“PASPA”). However, today, the value of a modern affiliate marketer far surpasses the number of first-time depositors they generate in a month. Rather, they also provide expert feedback, educate new players on betting responsibly and offer a low-risk marketing alternative to traditional advertising, as they are paid on performance.

Virtually every online gambling operator in the Unites States and in Europe utilizes affiliate marketing to get their brand in front of the most valuable customers — the high intent customers who are well-aware, well-informed and already interested players that generate more revenue. In fact, many of the end-users that browse an affiliate marketing website have already decided that they are going to open an account with a sportsbook or online poker room and wager online; however, they have not yet decided where they want to do that.

Due to technical tools and features like Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, digital marketing, analytics and the extended usage of cookies, the landscape of iGaming affiliate marketing has not just grown, it has transformed into a colossal global powerhouse, reshaping how millions engage with online gambling and online sports betting.  In fact, according to Grand View Research industry analysts, the global iGaming market is projected to balloon from $63.53 billion in 2022 to more than $153 million by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate of 11.7 from 2023 to 2030.   

Competition

A number of businesses exist in the market for performance marketing solutions for the sports betting and casino gaming industries. These businesses generally fall into three categories: small companies with some similar products but with minimal distribution; companies that acknowledge official rights but lack meaningful scale; and genuine competitors that offer similar products and services to the same target clients. SharpLink considers its most direct and relevant competitors to be Gambling.com, Catena Media and Better Collective.

The specific industries in which we operate are characterized by dynamic customer demand and technological advances, and there is significant competition among sports betting and casino gaming affiliate marketers. A number of established, well-financed companies producing online gaming and/or sports betting fan activation solutions compete with our service offerings, and other well-capitalized companies may introduce competitive services. There has also been consolidation among competitors in the sports betting and casino gaming industries and such consolidation and future consolidation could result in the formation of larger competitors with increased financial resources and altered cost structures, which may enable them to offer more competitive products and services, gain a larger market share, expand their product and service offerings and broaden their geographic scope of operations.

Our Competitive Strengths

SharpLink believes that the principal differentiating factors that set us apart from our competition include our market-centric portfolio of fan activation solutions, comprised of our proprietary affiliate marketing network, owned and operated U.S. state-specific D2P web properties, long-standing relationships with sportsbooks and casino gaming operators, ease of integration with our operating partners and scalability of our growth platform. SharpLink’s products, services, experience, industry relationships and corporate culture allow it to compete effectively across all these factors.

 Through the recent Sale of Business of our Sports Gaming Client Services and SportsHub Gaming Network businesses, SharpLink has emerged as a pure-play performance marketing company with a solid balance sheet, cash, no interest-bearing debt, significantly reduced operating expenses and a core team of affiliate marketing experts – all with an innate entrepreneurial mindset and a shared commitment to growth, cost discipline and long-term value creation.

Effectively managing our growth portfolio for long-term value creation.
 Our production and development programs present numerous investment opportunities that we believe will deliver long-term growth by providing our partners with valuable new customer acquisition capabilities made possible through our proprietary performance marketing solutions. We evaluate each opportunity independently, as well as within the context of other investment opportunities, to determine relative cost, timing and potential for generation of returns, and thereby its priority. This process helps us to make informed decisions regarding potential growth capital requirements and supports our allocation of resources based on relative risks and returns to maximize long-term value creation, which is the key objective of our growth strategy. We also review our portfolio on a regular basis to determine if and when to narrow our focus on the highest potential growth opportunities.

●

Fostering our entrepreneurial culture and continuing to attract, develop and retain highly skilled personnel.
 Our Company’s culture encourages innovation and entrepreneurialism, which helps to attract and retain highly skilled professionals. We intend to preserve this culture to nurture the design and development of innovative performance marketing solutions that help to distinguish us in the markets we serve.

Evaluation of strategic alternatives.  
On July 18, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors had initiated a formal review process to evaluate strategic alternatives for SharpLink, taking a measured approach to considering multiple proposals that had been received by the Company and other proposals it was expecting to receive.  Strategic alternatives under consideration have included, but are not limited to, a sale, merger, strategic business combination or other transaction.  As part of the Board's efforts to evaluate strategic alternatives, the Board and SharpLink's management team have been advancing discussions with those prospects believed to offer us the best opportunities to optimize our existing business operations, drive growth and create and optimize value for the Company's stockholders.
