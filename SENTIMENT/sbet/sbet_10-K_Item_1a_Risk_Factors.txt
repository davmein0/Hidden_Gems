Continuing Operations

As part of our strategy to expand our affiliate marketing services from Europe to the emerging American sports betting market, in November 2022, we began a systematic roll-out of our U.S.-focused performance-based marketing business with the launch of 15 state-specific, content-rich affiliate marketing websites. Our user-friendly, state-specific domains are designed to attract, acquire and drive local sports betting and casino traffic directly to our sportsbook and casino partners’ which are licensed to operate in each respective state. As of January 2024, we are licensed to operate in 18 jurisdictions and own and operate sites serving 17 U.S. states (Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming) and Puerto Rico. We largely utilize search engine optimization and programmatic advertising campaigns to drive traffic to our direct-to-player (“D2P”) sites.

In the first quarter of 2023, we unveiled SharpBetting.com, a U.S. sports betting education hub for experienced and novice sports fans. SharpBetting.com is a robust educational website dedicated to teaching new sports betting enthusiasts the fundamentals of, and winning strategies for, navigating the legal sports betting landscape responsibly.

Today, our vision is to power a targeted and personalized online sports betting and casino gaming environment that organically introduces fans to our operator partners through relevant tools and rich content – all in a safe, credible and responsible environment.

Discontinued Operations

SharpLink’s business-building platform also included the provision of F2P sports game and mobile app development services to a marquis list of customers, which included several of the biggest names in sports and sports betting, including Turner Sports, NBA, NFL, PGA TOUR, NASCAR and BetMGM, among others. In addition, we previously owned and operated a variety of proprietary real-money fantasy sports and sports simulation games and mobile apps through our SportsHub Gaming Network business unit, which also owned and operated LeagueSafe, one of the fantasy sports industry’s most trusted sources for collecting and protecting private fantasy league dues.

On January 18, 2024, SharpLink sold all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock or membership interests in a Sale of Business, as applicable, of our Sports Gaming Client Services and SportsHub Gaming Network business units to RSports for $22.5 million in an all-cash transaction. Nearly all of the employees of these acquired business units also moved to RSports to help ensure a seamless transaction.

The historical results of our Sports Gaming Client Services and SportsHub Gaming Network businesses have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods prior to the Sale of Business. Additional disclosures relating to the Sale of Business are provided in NOTE 3 included in the NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED December 31, 2024 and 2023.

In December 2023, the Company discontinued investments into and the operation of its C4 sports betting conversion technology (“C4”) due to the lack of market acceptance. C4 centered on cost effectively monetizing our own proprietary audiences and our customers’ audiences of U.S. fantasy sports and casual sports fans and casino gaming enthusiasts by converting them into loyal online sports and iGaming bettors.

SharpLink also previously owned and operated an enterprise telecom expense management business (“Enterprise TEM”) acquired in July 2021 in connection with SharpLink’s go-public merger with Mer Telemanagement Solutions. During 2022, we discontinued operations for this business unit and sought a buyer for the business. On December 31, 2022, we completed the sale of this business to Israel-based Entrypoint South Ltd.

SportsHub Merger
”
)

The Merger Agreement, as amended, contained the terms and conditions of the proposed business combination of SharpLink Israel and SportsHub. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as amended, on December 22, 2022, SportsHub merged with and into Merger Subsidiary with Merger Subsidiary surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of SharpLink Israel. In association with the transaction, SharpLink Israel issued, in the aggregate, 431,926 ordinary shares to common and preferred stockholders of SportsHub, on a fully diluted basis. An additional aggregate of 40,585 ordinary shares were held in escrow for SportsHub shareholders who had not yet provided the applicable documentation required in connection with the SportsHub Merger, as well as shares held in escrow for indemnifiable losses and for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Stockholder Representative in performing his duties pursuant to the Merger Agreement. On December 28, 2023, the escrow shares were disbursed to SportsHub shareholders in accordance with the Merger Agreement. 

Sale of Legacy MTS Business

On December 31, 2022, SharpLink Israel closed on the sale of its Legacy MTS to Israel-based Entrypoint South Ltd., a subsidiary of Entrypoint Systems 2004 Ltd. In consideration of Entrypoint South Ltd. acquiring all rights, title, interests and benefits to Legacy MTS, including 100% of the shares of MTS Integratrak Inc., one of the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries, Entrypoint South Ltd. will pay SharpLink an Earn-Out Payment equal to three times Legacy MTS’ EBITDA for the year ending December 31, 2023, up to a maximum earn-out payment of $1 million (adjusted to reflect net working capital as of the closing date). Within ten (10) calendar days of the approval by the board of directors of the Buyer of the audited annual financial statements of the Business as at December 31, 2023, and for the 12-month period ending on the Earn-Out Schedule Delivery Date, which shall occur no later than May 31, 2024, Buyer shall deliver to the Seller an Earn-out Schedule certified by its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer setting forth the computation of the Earn-Out Payment (as applicable), if any, together with the calculation thereof in an agreed Excel table format (including, but not limiting to all relevant details of the EBITDA calculations for the year 2023). Sharplink received an earnout payout of $297,387 during July 2024.

2023 Convertible Debenture and Warrant Financing

On February 15, 2023, SharpLink Israel issued a Debenture due February 15, 2026 in the original amount of $4,400,000 to Alpha. Pursuant to Section 8(a)(vi) of the Debenture, it is an event of default if SharpLink Israel is party to a fundamental transaction or agrees to sell or dispose of all or in excess of 33% of its assets in one transaction or a series of related transactions. In addition, on February 15, 2023, SharpLink Israel issued a warrant to Alpha to initially purchase 880,000 ordinary shares of SharpLink Israel (the “2023 Warrant”), which provides that in the event of a fundamental transaction, SharpLink Israel, at Alpha’s option, would repurchase the Warrant from Alpha on the terms set forth in Section 3(e)(ii) of the 2023 Warrant (the “Warrant Repurchase”).

In conjunction with the Convertible Debenture and Warrant issuance on February 14, 2023, 266,667 warrants that were previously issued to Alpha on November 19, 2021 were revalued on February 14, 2023, reducing the exercise price from $45.00 per warrant share to $0.60 per warrant share. The Company performed a Black Scholes model for the re-pricing of the warrants using the value of the underlying stock price of $5.10 stock price, exercise price of $0.60, expected dividend rate of 0%, risk-free interest rate of 4.04% and volatility of 52.57% and remaining term of 2.9 years. These same assumptions were applied to the 880,000 warrants. The value allocated to the warrants on November 19, 2021 was $11,435 and was recorded in Additional Paid-In Capital. The fair value of the re-priced warrants on February 15, 2023 was $1,218,205, an increase of $1,206,771. The incremental value of the warrants is also recorded in Additional Paid-In Capital as of December 31, 2023 as a deemed dividend.

On January 19, 2024, SharpLink and Alpha entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) whereby Alpha agreed to waive (i) the event of default under Section 8(a)(vi) of the Debenture and Section 3(e)(ii) of the 2023 Warrant in connection with the Sale of Business; and (ii) payment of the Mandatory Default Amount; and the parties agreed that SharpLink will pay 110% of the outstanding principal amount of the Debenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, in the aggregate total amount of $4,484,230 (the “Debenture Redemption Amount”). On January 19, 2024, the Company paid Alpha the Debenture Redemption Amount. As a result, the Company’s obligations under the Debenture have been satisfied.

Pursuant to Section 5(1) of the 2023 Warrant, Alpha further agreed to waive its right to elect that, in connection with and at the closing of the Sale of Business, the 2023 Warrant shall be repurchased by the Company as set forth in Section 3(e) of the 2023 Warrant. The Parties agreed in the Settlement Agreement that the Warrant Repurchase for its Black Scholes value shall take place upon the earlier of (a) June 30, 2024; (b) the Company raising a gross amount of not less than $3,000,000 whether by equity or debt; and (c) the Company entering into a “fundamental transaction” as defined in the 2023 Warrant. The Parties further agree in the Settlement Agreement to fix the Black Scholes value of the 2023 Warrant for purposes of the Warrant Repurchase at $900,000.

On March 6, 2024, SharpLink entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Alpha to change the Warrant Repurchase of $900,000. Pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to exchange the 2023 Warrant for (i) 156,207 shares of Common Stock (the “Shares”), (ii) a pre-funded warrant in the amount of 469,560 shares of Common Stock (the “Pre-Funded Warrant”) and (iii) the unexchanged balance of the 2023 Warrant Repurchase (the “Warrant Repurchase Balance”). The Warrant Repurchase Balance of 254,233 warrants is valued at $170,636 and shall be subject to the repurchase terms set forth in the Settlement Agreement. The Pre-Funded Warrant and the Warrant Repurchase Balance were valued using Black Scholes option-pricing model. As part of this transaction, the Company recorded a deemed dividend of $44,619 as presented in the statement of stockholders’ equity for the year ended December 31, 2024.

On June 30, 2024
,
 SharpLink negotiated an Amendment to the Exchange Agreement (the "Amendment") to reduce the strike price per warrant of the unexchanged balance of the 2023 Warrants Repurchase Balance from $4.07 to $0.0001 and to remove the re-purchase option. The modification to the Exchange Agreement was valued on June 29, 2024, the day before the modification, using the Black Scholes option-pricing model.  The Company recorded a fair value adjustment of $17,996﻿ on the condensed consolidated statements of operations during the second quarter of 2024 and removed the remaining accrued warrant liability of $152,386 through an adjustment to additional paid in capital. On December 9, 2024, Alpha exercised 120,000 warrants from the 2023 Warrants Repurchase Balance at a strike price per warrant of $.0001 per share. Additionally, on January 23, 2024, Alpha exercised 266,667 warrants issued pursuant to the Exchange Agreement at a strike price per warrant of $.60 per share with the Company receiving approximately $160,000. Further, during this same period, 2,500 warrants with a strike price of $0 were exercised by former management of MTS.

Change in Share Capital

On October 24, 2023, SharpLink Israel held an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders at which shareholders approved the adoption of an amendment to SharpLink Israel’s amended and restated articles of association to increase authorized share capital of SharpLink Israel from 9,290,000 ordinary shares, nominal value NIS 0.60 per share, to 100,000,000 ordinary shares, nominal value NIS 0.60 per share, and a corresponding amendment to SharpLink Israel’s memorandum of association.

Potential Reverse St
ock-Split

On November 5, 2024, SharpLink Gaming, Inc.'s Board of Directors unanimously adopted resolutions approving, declaring advisable and recommending to the stockholders for their approval a proposal to authorize the Board of Directors, in its discretion, to amend our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding Common Stock at a ratio of up to and including 6:1, such ratio to be determined by the Board of Directors, including any increase in our authorized capital required in the event a fractional share will be created as a result of the reverse stock split. On December 23, 2024 at SharpLink's Annual General Meeting of Stockholders, stockholders approved the reverse stock split, granting the Board of Directors the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to carry out such action, with the exact exchange ratio and timing to be determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may determine in its discretion not to effect the reverse stock split and not to file any amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.  The primary purpose for effecting the reverse stock split, should the Board of Directors choose to effect one, would be to increase the per share price of SharpLink's Common Stock to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). 

On July 17, 2024, the Company received a letter (the "Bid Price Deficiency Notice”) from Nasdaq notifying the Company that, because the closing bid price for its common stock had been below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, it was not compliant with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. In accordance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company had a period of 180 calendar days, or until January 7, 2025, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If at any time before January 7, 2025, the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock closed at or above $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days (which number days may be extended by Nasdaq), Nasdaq would provide written notification that the Company had achieved compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, and the matter would be resolved.

On January 8, 2025, SharpLink received a letter (the "Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq indicating the Company’s continued non-compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) (the "Bid Price Rule”). The Notice from the Staff informed the Company that the Staff had determined that the Company has not regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and was not eligible for a second 180-day compliance period, due to the Company’s previously reported failure to comply with the $5,000,000 minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market as required under Listing Rule 5505(b)(1). SharpLink is working to evidence compliance with Minimum Bid Price Requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and intends to submit a plan to that effect to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the "Panel”) as part of the hearing process, which is expected to include plans to effect the reverse stock split. However, there can be no assurance the Panel will grant any request for continued listing or that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the applicable listing criteria within the period of time that may be granted by the Panel even in the event that the Company's Board elects to effect a reverse stock split of its share capital. See NOTE 18 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS included in the NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Sale of Sports Gaming Services and SportsHub Gaming Network Operating Segments

On January 18, 2024, Parent Seller and SLG1 Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and the Subsidiary Seller, SHGN (and together with Parent Seller and Subsidiary Seller, the “Seller”), a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of SharpLink, entered into a Purchase Agreement (the “PA”) with RSports, a Minnesota corporation (“Buyer”). The Subsidiary Seller owned all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Sports Technologies, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company, SHGN and Holdings Quinn, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (collectively referred to as the “Targets”). The PA contemplated the sale of the Company’s Sports Gaming Services and SportsHub Gaming Network business units to the Buyer, by selling all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock or membership interests of the Targets and the Acquired Subsidiaries for $22,500,000 in an all cash transaction.

As a result of the Sale of Business, we have ceased our Sports Gaming Client Services and SportsHub Gaming Network operations. The historical results of these business segments have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods prior to the closing date of the Sale of Business on January 18, 2024. See NOTE 3 included in the NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Nasdaq Deficiency Notices

2023 Continued Listing Deficiencies

     On May 23, 2023, SharpLink received a notice (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) stating that SharpLink did not comply with the equity standard for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the “Rule”) requires listed companies to maintain stockholders’ equity of at least $2.5 million under the net equity standard. As of the SharpLink Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, SharpLink reported total stockholders’ deficit of $4,463,917. SharpLink did not meet the alternative standards for market value of listed securities or net income from continuing operations, thus SharpLink was not in compliance with Nasdaq’s Listing Rule. As reported on a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 12, 2023, SharpLink submitted a hearing request with the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) on November 28, 2023, relating to the Staff’s determination to delist the Company’s securities from Nasdaq due to the Company’s failure to meet the minimum $2.5 million shareholders’ equity requirement for continued listing as defined by the Rule. On November 28, 2023, the Company was notified by Nasdaq that an oral hearing (the “Hearing”) had been scheduled for February 20, 2024; and, the delisting action referenced in the Staff’s determination letter, dated November 21, 2023, had been stayed, pending a final determination by the Panel.

     On January 24, 2024, SharpLink filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC, disclosing details of the sale of its Sports Gaming Client Services and SportsHub Gaming Network business units to RSports Interactive, Inc. for $22.5 million in an all-cash transaction (the “Sale of Business”). As a result of the Sale of Business, the Company’s total stockholders’ equity exceeded $2.5 million as of the date of the above referenced Form 8-K filing. As a result of the Sale of Business, the Company believed that it had regained compliance with all applicable continued listing requirements and had requested that the Staff determine whether the Hearing should be cancelled. On February 7, 2024, SharpLink received formal notification from Nasdaq that the Company’s previously announced deficiency under the Rule had been cured, and the Company had regained compliance with all applicable continued listing standards. Therefore, the Hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel, originally scheduled for February 20, 2024, was cancelled.

2024 Continued Listing Deficiencies

   As previously announced in a press release, dated July 17, 2024, and reported on Form 10-Q filed by the Company on August 15, 2024, the Company received a letter on July 17, 2024, from Nasdaq notifying the Company that, because the closing bid price for its Common Stock had been below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive trading days, it was not compliant with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement (the "Bid Price Deficiency Notice”). In accordance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company had a period of 180 calendar days, or until January 7, 2025, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. Further, as previously reported on our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 22, 2024, the Nasdaq Staff notified the Company that it did not comply with the $2.5 million minimum stockholders’ equity requirement, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).  The Company had 45 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance or until January 6, 2025.

     On January 8, 2025, SharpLink received a letter (the "Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq indicating the Company’s continued non-compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2) (the "Bid Price Rule”). The Notice from the Staff informed the Company that the Staff had determined that the Company has not regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and was not eligible for a second 180-day compliance period, due to the Company’s previously reported failure to comply with the $5,000,000 minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market as required under Listing Rule 5505(b)(1). 

   The Companys requested and received a hearing with the Nasdaq Hearing Panel, which took place on February 25, 2025. The Company’s Common Stock will remain listed and eligible for trading on Nasdaq pending the ultimate conclusion of the hearing process.  SharpLink is working to evidence compliance with both the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and Minimum Stockholder’s Equity Requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and intends to submit a plan to that effect to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the "Panel”) as part of the hearing process; however, there can be no assurance the Panel will grant any request for continued listing or that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the applicable listing criteria within the period of time that may be granted by the Panel. See NOTE 18 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS included in the NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Redomestication from Israel to Delaware

On February 13, 2024, SharpLink Israel completed its previously announced Domestication Merger, pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Domestication Merger Agreement, dated June 14, 2023 and amended July 24, 2023, among SharpLink Israel, SharpLink Merger Sub Ltd., an Israeli company and a Domestication Merger Sub and SharpLink US. The Domestication Merger was achieved through a merger of SharpLink Merger Sub with and into SharpLink Israel, with SharpLink Israel surviving the merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of SharpLink US. The Domestication Merger was approved by the shareholders of SharpLink Israel at an extraordinary special meeting of shareholders held on December 6, 2023. SharpLink US’s Common Stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the same ticker symbol, SBET, on February 14, 2024.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our most critical estimates include those related to use of accounting for revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, warrants
 and 
discontinued operations. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements. See NOTE 1 included in the NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED December 31, 2024 and 2023, which are included in ITEM 8 “FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” of this Annual Report, for our Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. There have been no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.

Revenue Recognition

The Company follows a five-step model to assess each sale to a customer; identify the legally binding contract, identify the performance obligations, determine the transaction price, allocate the transaction price, and determine whether revenue will be recognized at a point in time or over time. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services (i.e., performance obligations) to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for promised goods or services. Management judgment is required in determining whether the performance obligations will be recognized at a point in time or overtime and when the transfer of control of goods and services are made to entitle the Company to receive payment. The exercise of management judgment has a material impact on when revenue is recognized.

The Affiliate Marketing Services operating segment generates revenue by earning commissions from sportsbooks and casino operators when a new depositor is directed to them by our affiliate marketing websites and our PAS network.

Stock-Based Compensation

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black Scholes option-pricing model. Significant management assumptions and estimates are made when using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The Company uses historical option exercise and termination data to estimate the expected term the options are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend yield is calculated using historical dividend amounts and the stock price at the option issue date. The expected volatility is determined using the volatility of peer companies. The Company’s underlying stock has been publicly traded since the date of the MTS Merger. All option grants during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were granted under the 2021 plan subsequent to the MTS Merger.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company issued to members of its Board of Directors and its executives a total of 500,000 RSUs that were converted into 350,001 shares of Common Stock registered pursuant to Form S-8s (Registration No. 333-277612 and Registration No. 333-268631); and based on a quarterly vesting schedule.

Warrants

The fair value of warrants is estimated on the date of grant using a Black Scholes option-pricing model. If an agreement calls for the repricing of a warrant, the Company also uses a Black Scholes option-pricing model. Significant management assumptions and estimates are made when using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The Company uses the underlying stock price, the exercise price, expected dividend assumptions, rate risk-free interest rate, estimated volatility and remaining term to calculate the warrant's value using the Black Scholes option-pricing model.

Discontinued Operations

In accordance with ASC 205-20 Presentation of Financial Statements: Discontinued Operations, a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major impact on an entity’s operations and financial results when the components of an entity meets the criteria in ASC paragraph 205-20-45-10. In the period in which the component meets the held for sale or discontinued operations criteria, the major assets, other assets, current liabilities and non-current liabilities shall be reported as a component of total assets and liabilities separate from those balances of the continuing operations. At the same time, the results of all discontinued operations, less applicable income taxes (benefit), shall be reported as components of net income (loss) separate from the income (loss) of continuing operations.

In June 2022, SharpLink Israel’s Board of Directors approved management to enter into negotiations to sell MTS. SharpLink Israel negotiated a Share and Asset Purchase Agreement with the transaction completed on December 31, 2022.

In December 2023, the Company discontinued investment into and operation of its C4 sports betting conversion technology (“C4”) due to the lack of market acceptance. C4 centered on cost effectively monetizing our own proprietary audiences and our customers’ respective audiences of U.S. fantasy sports and casual sports fans and casino gaming enthusiasts by converting them into loyal online sports and iGaming bettors.

Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

For the Year Ended December 31, 2024 as Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023

Revenues

For the year ended December 31, 2024, revenues decreased 26.1% to $3,662,349 as compared to revenues of $4,952,725 reported for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease was largely due to market conditions softening and the loss of customers. The sports betting, poker and casino industries are facing increased government regulation and oversight, including increased taxes, both internationally and in the United States. This has contributed to players considering alternative gambling platforms such as "grey" or "black" gambling markets. The Company does not participate in any "grey" to "black" gambling markets. 

Gross Profit

For the year ended December 31, 2024, gross profit decreased 40.9% to $906,273 from $1,532,663 reported for the previous year. The decline represents softening of market conditions (see revenues explanation above) and higher casino payouts due to large winnings by individuals during the year ended December 31, 2024. For the casino business, as greater payouts are made to winners, this has the impact of reducing gross profit.

Total Operating Expenses

For the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, total operating expenses decreased 45.6% to $5,669,248 from $10,425,865reported for the prior year. The notable drop in total operating expenses was primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses which decreased to $5,669,248 in 2024 from $7,961,133 in 2023. The decrease was due to cost savings initiatives by the Company that resulted in lower payroll costs, lower marketing costs, deceases in insurance expenses and a reduction in travel and travel related costs. The improvement was further impacted by reduced non-cash goodwill and intangible impairment expenses, which totaled $- and $2,464,732 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Operating Loss

Operating loss decreased 46.4% for the 12-months ended December 31, 2024, declining to $(4,762,975) as compared to $(8,893,202) for the 12-month ended December 31, 2023.

Net Loss from Continuing Operations

After factoring the provision for income tax expenses of $232 and total other expense of $289,100, inclusive of $(324,518) in interest expense and $255,819 in the change in fair value of our Convertible Debenture, the net loss from our continuing operations was reduced to $(4,473,643) for the year ended December 31, 2024. This compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $(11,248,598) for the prior year after factoring total other income of $(2,339,688) and an income tax expense totaling $(15,708)

Net Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax

Net income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax increased 586.7% to $14,573,262 from $(2,994,584) for the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This increase was due to the gain on the sale of Sports Gaming Client Services and SportsHub Gaming Network.

Net Income (Loss)

As a result of the aforementioned reasons, net income for the 12 months ended December 31, 2024 totaled $10,099,619, which was an improvement from the net loss of $(14,243,182) reported for the prior year.

Cash Flows

Year Ended December 31, 2024 as Compared to the Year ended December 31, 2023

As of December 31, 2024, cash on hand was $1,436,729, an -42.2% increase when compared to cash on hand of $2,487,481 as of December 31, 2023.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash used for operating activities totaled $(5,856,053) compared to net cash used for operating activities of $(4,916,412) in the prior year. The change in the net operating cashflows was due to increased gross margins in 2023 versus 2024. After factoring net cash used for operating activities for discontinued operations of $(16,958,433), net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations totaled $(22,814,486) for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to net cash used by continuing operating activities from operations of $(4,916,412) after factoring $5,499,299 of net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations, cash provided by operations activiti

For the year ended December 31, 2024, net cash provided by the Company’s investing activities from continuing operations totaled $148,281, a increase of 151.8% when compared to cash used for investing activities from continuing operations of $(286,146) for the previous year. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, net cash used for investing activities from discontinued operations was $(18,857,834), compared to net cash used by investing activities from discontinued operations of $(745,951), respectively. Net cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $(18,709,553), which compared to net cash generated by investing activities for continuing operations of $(1,032,097) for the year ended December 31, 2023.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $(11,539,883), a 224.0% decrease when compared to net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations of $9,303,279 provided from financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023. The year-over-year change was largely due to the issuance of a $4,000,000 convertible debenture to an institutional investor and proceeds from a line of credit secured from our commercial lender in February 2023, offset primarily by repayments of debt. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, net cash used in and provided for financing activities from discontinued operations was $(5,835,352), and $481,575, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2024, we had working capital of $2,066,348. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred a net loss from continuing operations of $(4,473,643), representing a 60.2% decrease from a loss from continuing operations of $(11,248,598) for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023. In the pursuit of SharpLink’s growth strategy, the Company has sustained continued operating losses.

SharpLink Israel completed the Sale of Business of our Sports Gaming Client Services and SportsHub Gaming Network business units for $22.5 million in an all cash transaction in January 2024. In connection with the closing of Sale of Business, SharpLink repaid in full all outstanding term loans and lines of credit with Platinum Bank, together with accrued but unpaid interest and all other amounts due in connection with such repayment under existing credit agreements, totaling an aggregate $14,836,625 and thereby terminating all existing credit facilities with Platinum Bank and discharging the debt on the Company’s balance sheet. In addition, we redeemed the outstanding convertible debenture issued to Alpha for 110% of the outstanding balance, plus accrued and unpaid interest, or $4,484,230, thereby satisfying all obligations under the debenture and discharging the debt on the balance sheet.

On May 2, 2024, the Company entered into an At-The-Market ("ATM") Sales Agreement (the "ATM Sales Agreement”) with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (the "Agent”) pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, through the Agent, as sales agent and/or principal, shares of its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Common Stock”), having an aggregate offering price of up to $1,676,366, subject to certain limitations on the amount of Common Stock that may be offered and sold by the Company set forth in the ATM Sales Agreement (the "Offering”). The Company is not obligated to make any sales of Common Stock under the ATM Sales Agreement and any determination by the Company to do so will be dependent, among other things, on market conditions and the Company’s working capital needs. As of December 31, 2024, SharpLink had raised gross proceeds of $896,215 (net proceeds of $869,329, less professional fees) from the sale of 1,128,380 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the ATM Sales Agreement.

On February 4, 2025, the Company filed a prospectus supplement that amended and supplemented the ATM Sales Agreement (see Note 9) and the information in the  prospectus supplement, dated May 2, 2024, relating to the offer and sale of up to $1,676,366 of our shares of Common Stock, $0.0001 par value per share.  Through February 6, 2025, the Company has sold 2,843,902 shares of Common Stock in accordance with the ATM Sales Agreement under the initial and supplemental prospectuses with total proceeds to the Company of $1,834,925.

   The aggregate market value of our outstanding shares of Common Stock held by non-affiliates as of February 4, 2025 was $5,505,158, based on 6,259,056 shares of Common Stock outstanding, of which 5,856,552 were held by non-affiliates, and a closing price on Nasdaq of $0.94 on December 6, 2024, which is within 60 days of the date of this prospectus supplement. Accordingly, under the terms of the ATM Sales Agreement, we may offer and sell through the initial prospectus, as amended and supplemented by this supplement, shares of Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $1,835,052 from time to time to or through the Agents.
   We have sold 2,843,905 shares of Common Stock in accordance with the Sales Agreement under the initial prospectus. 
   There is no remaining availability under the initial and supplemental prospectuses.

We may need to raise additional capital to fund the Company’s growth and future business operations. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges, develop new technology and services or enhance our existing offering, track and comply with applicable laws and regulations, improve our operating infrastructure, enhance our information security systems to combat changing cyber threats and expand personnel to support our business, we may have to delay or reduce the scope of planned strategic growth initiatives. Moreover, any additional equity financing that we obtain may dilute the ownership held by our existing shareholders. The economic dilution to our shareholders will be significant if our stock price does not materially increase, or if the effective price of any sale is below the price paid by a particular shareholder. Any debt financing could involve substantial restrictions on activities and creditors could seek additional pledges of some or all of our assets. If we fail to obtain additional funding as needed, we may be forced to cease or scale back operations, and our results, financial conditions and stock price would be adversely affected. As such, these factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

On December 31, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Additionally, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.

Contractual Obligations

Material contractual obligations arising in the normal course of business primarily consist of purchase obligations in the normal course of business, principal and interest payment obligations to our commercial lender and debtholders and payments for lease obligations.

Inflation

Our opinion is that inflation did not have a material effect on our operations for 2024.

Climate Change

Our opinion is that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any material effect on our operations.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09 – Income Taxes (Topic ASC 740) Income Taxes. The ASU improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 will become effective beginning of our 2025 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. We do not expect that this guidance will have a material impact upon our financial position and results of operations.

In November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2024-03,

ASU 2024-03, as clarified by ASU 2025-01, is effective for us for our annual reporting for fiscal 2028 and for interim period reporting beginning in fiscal 2029 on a prospective basis. Both early adoption and retrospective application are permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of these standards will have on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

Also, in November 2024, the Financial Account Standards Board (FASB), issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2024-04, 
Debt-Debt with Conversions and Other Option.
 ASU 2024-04 is intended to clarify requirements for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments, including convertible debt instruments with cash conversion features or convertible debt instruments that are not currently convertible, should be accounted for as an induced conversion. This ASU is effective for all entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2025, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of this guidance on its disclosures.

Management
’
s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP.

Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance of such reliability and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projection of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management has conducted, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting used the criteria set forth in SEC Release 33-8810 based on the framework established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in 
Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
—
 Guidance for Smaller Public Companies. 
Based on this evaluation, Management concluded that our system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024, based on these criteria.

This Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. As a smaller reporting company, our management’s report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only the management’s report.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

SharpLink Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Minneapolis, Minnesota

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SharpLink Gaming, Inc. and Subsidiaries, formerly known as SharpLink Gaming, Ltd. and Subsidiaries, (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2024 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Explanatory Paragraph 
–
 Going Concern

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations that raise substantial doubt about their ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s evaluations of the events and conditions and management’s plans regarding those matters are also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements; and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

Description of Matter

As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, a significant portion of the Company’s revenue recognized is for commission and fee revenue and software license contracts that include multiple performance obligations including, but not limited to, the following: development, hosting, operations, maintenance, and service of games and contests.

Due to the nature of the Company’s revenue sources including multiple performance obligations, management exercises significant judgment in the following areas in determining appropriate revenue recognition:

●

Determination of which products and services are considered to be a distinct performance obligation that should be accounted for separately or combined.

●

Determination of the pattern of delivery for each distinct performance obligation.

●

Determination of which products and services are recognized over time or point in time.

●

Determination of recognition of the contract liabilities which also included prize liability and customer deposits.

As a result, a high degree of auditor judgment was required in performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s judgments. Changes in these estimates can have a material effect on the amount of revenue recognized on these contracts.

    F-2

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

Based on our knowledge of the Company, we determined the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over revenue, including the determination of revenue streams over which those procedures were performed. Our audit procedures included the following for each revenue stream where procedures were performed:

●

Obtained an understanding of the internal controls and processes in place over the Company’s revenue recognition processes.

●

Analyzed the significant assumptions and estimates made by management as discussed above.

●

Selected a sample of revenue transactions and assessed the recorded revenue, analyzed the related contract, assessed likelihood of collection, tested management’s identification of distinct performance obligations, and compared amounts recognized for consistency within underlying documentation.

Convertible Debenture and Related Warrants

Description of Matter

At December 31, 2024, the Company had a convertible note with an outstanding principal balance of $4.0 million net of debt discount, warrant discount, accrued interest, and changes in fair value contributing to a reported fair value as of December 31, 2024 of $4.4 million. In connection with the issuance of the convertible note, the Company also issued new and modified existing warrants with the holder. Calculations and accounting for the convertible note and warrant at fair value require management’s judgments related to initial and subsequent recognition, use of a valuation model, and determination of the appropriate inputs used in the selected valuation model. As more fully described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company made an election at the time of issuance to record the convertible note at its fair value with changes in fair value recorded through the consolidated statements of operations. To value the convertible note, the Company utilized a Monte Carlo Simulation to incorporate certain probabilities and assumptions determined at issuance and at December 31, 2024. A Black-Scholes valuation method was used in measuring the fair value of the warrants.

Auditing management’s valuations of the convertible note and related warrants was challenging due to the complexity of the valuation model and the inputs that are highly sensitive to changes such as the common stock market price, volatility, risk free rates, and yields.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

Based on our knowledge of the Company, we determined the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over the convertible note and related warrants, including the determination of proper accounting treatment and the initial and subsequent measurement principles applied. Our audit procedures included the following:

●

Obtained an understanding of the internal controls and processes in place over the Company’s recording of significant and unusual transactions dealing with complex accounting.

●

Obtained and analyzed contracts related to the convertible note and warrants.

●

Tested completeness and accuracy of the data used as well as management’s application of the relevant accounting guidance.

●

Assessed the intent and ability of management while evaluating certain assumptions utilized in the valuation models.

●

We evaluated the Company’s determination of fair value of the convertible note, including testing the appropriateness of the methodology used and assessing the reasonableness of the underlying inputs.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE YEARS ENDED

 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of Business

The Company is a Delaware corporation. SharpLink is an online performance marketing company that delivers unique fan activation solutions to its sportsbook and casino partners. Through its global affiliate marketing network, known as PAS.net, SharpLink drives qualified traffic and player acquisitions, retention and conversions to U.S. regulated sportsbooks and global casino gaming partners worldwide. In addition, SharpLink owns a performance marketing platform through which the Company owns and operates state-specific web domains designed to attract, acquire and drive local sports betting and casino traffic directly to its sportsbook and casino partners which are licensed to operate in each respective state.

Prior to the sale of SharpLink’s Sports Gaming Client Services and SportsHub Gaming Network business units in 
 January 2024 
to RSports Interactive, Inc. (“RSports”), a Minnesota corporation, (the “Sale of Business”), the SportsHub Gaming Network unit owned and operated an online gaming business that primarily facilitated daily and seasonal peer-to-peer fantasy contests for its end users. The SportsHub Gaming Network business unit also operated a website that provided a variety of services to private fantasy league commissioners, including secure online payment options, transparent tracking and reporting of transactions, payment reminders, in-season security of league funds, and facilitation of prize payouts. SharpLink’s Free-to-Play (
"F2P"
) sports game development business was engaged in the provision of 
F2P
 sports game and mobile app development services to a marquis list of customers, which included several of the biggest names in sports and sports betting, including Turner Sports, NBA, NFL, PGA TOUR, NASCAR and BetMGM, among others.

On 
 January 18, 2024, 
the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement (the “PA”) with RSports to sell the Company’s fantasy sports and sports game development business units to RSports. All of the issued and outstanding common stock or membership interests of Sports Technologies, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company, SHGN and Holdings Quinn, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (collectively referred to as the “Divested Operations”) were sold for $
22,500,000
 in an all cash transaction. The transaction resulted in SharpLink selling a majority of its assets and the classification of the Divested Operation’s financial results as discontinued operations. All prior periods presented have been restated to present the Divested Operations financial results as discontinued operations. All explanations and amounts relating to discontinued operations are referred throughout the consolidated financial statements to
 Note 
3
 - Discontinued Operations.

On 
 February 13, 2024, 
SharpLink Israel completed its previously announced domestication merger (“Domestication Merger”), pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Domestication Merger Agreement”), dated 
 June 14, 2023 
and amended 
 July 24, 2023, 
among SharpLink Israel, SharpLink Merger Sub Ltd., an Israeli company and a wholly owned subsidiary of SharpLink US (“Domestication Merger Sub”) and SharpLink Gaming, Inc. (“SharpLink US”). The Domestication Merger was achieved through a merger of SharpLink Merger Sub with and into SharpLink Israel, with SharpLink Israel surviving the merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of SharpLink US. The Domestication Merger was approved by the shareholders of SharpLink Israel at an extraordinary special meeting of shareholders held on 
 December 6, 2023. 
SharpLink US’s Common Stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the same ticker symbol, SBET, on 
 February 14, 2024. 

As a result of the Domestication Merger, all SharpLink Israel ordinary shares outstanding immediately prior to the Domestication Merger will automatically convert, on a 
one
-for-
one
 basis, into the right to receive, and become exchangeable for, shares of SharpLink US common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share (“Common Stock”) and all preferred shares, options, and warrants of SharpLink Israel outstanding immediately prior to the Domestication Merger will be converted into or exchanged for equivalent securities of SharpLink US on a 
one
-for-
one
 basis.

The following represents the expected change in the par value based on the outstanding ordinary and preferred shares at 
 December 31, 2023 
to common and preferred stock after the redomestication on 
 February 13, 2024:

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SharpLink Gaming Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions between consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.

Table of Contents

We operate in 
one
 reportable segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), our Chief Executive Officer, allocates resources and assesses performance based upon discrete financial information at the segment level.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to reflect the impact of the discontinued operations treatment in order to conform to the current period presentation. 
See Note 
3.
 During the year ended 
 December 31, 2024, 
we realigned our organizational structure and resources to more closely align with our strategic priorities.  As a result of the change, we have 
one
 reportable segment, consisting of Affiliate Marketing, for the purpose of making operational and resource decisions and assessing financial performance.  See 
Note 
13
.

Functional Currency

The Company’s functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. The resulting monetary assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the subsequent balance sheet date. Revenue and expense components are translated to U.S. dollars at weighted-average exchange rates in effect during the period. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are recognized in other income, net within the consolidated statements of operations.

Reverse Share Split

On 
 April 23, 2023, 
the Company effected a 
one
-for-
ten
 (
1:10
) reverse share split of all the Company’s share capital and adopted amendments to its Memorandum of Association and Second Amended and Restated Articles of Association (“M&AA”) whereby the Company (i) decreased the number of issued and outstanding ordinary shares, nominal value NIS 
0.60
 per share, from 
26,881,244
 to 
2,688,541;
 (ii) reduced the total number of the Company’s authorized shares under its M&AA from 
92,900,000
 shares of ordinary shares, nominal value NIS 
0.06
 (USD 
0.02
) per share, to 
9,290,000
 shares of ordinary shares, nominal value NIS 
0.60
 (USD 
0.20
) per share; and (ii) decreased by a ratio of 
one
-for-
ten
 (
1:10
) the number of retrospectively issued and outstanding shares of ordinary shares. Proportional adjustments for the reverse stock split were made to the Company’s outstanding stock options, warrants and equity incentive plans. All share and per-share data and amounts have been retrospectively adjusted as of the earliest period presented in the financial statements to reflect the reverse stock split.

Discontinued Operations

In 
 June 2022, 
the Company’s Board of Directors approved management to enter into negotiations to sell MTS. The Company completed the sale of MTS on 
 December 31, 2022. 
Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the MTS business are separately reported as assets and liabilities from discontinued operations as of

 December 31, 2024
 and 
2023
 The results of operations and cash flows of MTS for all periods are separately reported as discontinued operations.

In 
 December 2023, 
the Company’s Board of Directors approved management to enter into a Letter of Intent with RSports for RSports to purchase the Company’s Sports Gaming Client Services and SportsHub Gaming Network businesses.

In 
 December 2023, 
the Company discontinued its 
C4
 technology due to the lack of market acceptance. 
C4
 technology centered on cost effectively monetizing our own and our customers’ respective online audiences of U.S. fantasy sports and casual sports fans and casino gaming enthusiasts by converting them into loyal online sports and iGaming bettors.

On 
 January 18, 2024, 
the Company entered into a PA with RSports to sell the Company’s Sports Gaming Client Services and SHGN business units to RSports. All of the membership interests of Sports Technologies, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company, Holdings Quinn, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and SHGN who owns all of the issued membership interests in SportsHub Reserve, LLC, (“SHReserve”), a Minnesota limited liability company; SportsHub PA, LLC, (“SHPA”), a Pennsylvania limited liability company, and SportsHub Holdings, LLC, (“SHHoldings”), a Minnesota limited liability company, and SportsHub Operations, LLC, (“SHOperations”), a Minnesota limited liability company (SHReserve, SHPA, SHHoldings and SHOperations, collectively, the “SHGN Subsidiaries”) were sold for $
22,500,000
 in an all-cash transaction. The amount of cash received from sale of business, net of cash transferred of $
18,857,834
, as reflected on the statement of cash flows, reflects the receipt of cash of $
22,500,000
, net of the cash transferred of $
41,357,834
. The majority of cash transferred of $
41,357,834
 was reflected in discontinued operations customer deposits liability and deferred revenue of $
36,959,573
 and $
4,888,704
, respectively.

Restricted Cash

Restricted cash consists of funds held for payment of prize liabilities for various daily and seasonal peer-to-peer fantasy games. The Company maintained separate accounts to segregate users’ funds from operational funds. 
See Note 
3.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Cash and restricted cash are deposited with major banks in the United States and Israel. Such deposits in the United States 
 may 
be in excess of insured limits and are 
not
 insured in other jurisdictions. Generally, the FDIC limit per bank is 
$250,000.
 Any loss incurred or a lack of access to such funds above the FDIC limit could have a significant adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

The following represents the cash on hand at 
 December 31, 2024
 by banking institution and does 
not
 include any reduction for the FDIC insured limit of 
$250,000.

The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers. In certain circumstances, the Company 
 may 
require letters of credit, other collateral or additional guarantees.

Accounts Receivable

The Company’s policy for estimating the allowance for credit losses on accounts receivables considers several factors including historical loss experience, the age of delinquent receivable balances due, and economic conditions. Specific customer reserves are made during review of significant outstanding balances due, in which customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
 may 
indicate that it is probable the receivable will 
not
 be recovered. Accounts receivables are written off after collection efforts occur and the receivable is deemed uncollectible. Adjustments to the allowance for credit losses are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense. During the years ended 
 December 31, 2024 
and 
2023
, there was 
no
 amount of the allowance for credit losses. The Company recognized unbilled revenue when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing.

Table of Contents

Investment, cost

During the year ended 
 December 31, 2021, 
the Company invested $
200,000
 in Quintar, Inc. an augmented reality company headquartered in California. This investment provided the Company with 
280,903
 shares, which equates to a 
1.12
% ownership interest in Quintar. SharpLink does 
not
 exercise significant control over Quintar due to its minority ownership role and the fact that SharpLink does 
not
 have a seat on Quintar’s Board of Directors, nor hold any special voting rights. As a result, of the Company’s lack of influence over Quintar and the fact that the valuation of Quintar is 
not
 easily determinable (privately held business with few transactions) the Company accounts for the Quintar investment through the cost method of accounting. The Company reviews the investment for impairment at each reporting period based on current conditions. This is informed by Quintar’s operating results and financing activities. 
No
 impairment was indicated related to the Quintar investment for the year ended 
 December 31, 2023. 
The investment was sold as part of the Sale of Business to RSports. 
See Note 
3.

Contract Assets

Contract assets include unbilled revenue, which is the amount of revenue recognized in excess of the amount billed to customers and costs incurred incremental to the contract and to fulfill contract obligations. 
See Note 
3.

Deferred Prize Expense

Deferred prize expense consists of the expense related to prize funds offered through various fantasy games hosted by the Company. These prize funds are paid to the participants once a fantasy game has concluded and final winners have been determined. Deferred prize expense is recognized over the life of the fantasy games and is reported as a current asset in discontinued operations. 
See Note 
3.

Equipment

Equipment is recorded at cost. Expenditures for renewals and improvements that significantly add to the productivity capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed. When equipment is retired or sold, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts and the resultant gain or loss is reflected in income. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method, based on useful lives of the assets which ranges from 
three
 to 
seven
 years. Depreciation expense from continuing operations for the years ended 
 December 31, 2024 
and 
2023
, was $
7,152
 and $
10,289
, respectively. Accumulated depreciation from continuing operations as of 
 December 31, 2024 
and 
2023
 was $
31,911
 and $
24,759
, respectively.

Leases

The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception or modification of the arrangement. An arrangement is or contains a lease if there are identified assets and the right to control the use of an identified asset is conveyed for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control over the use of the identified asset means the lessee has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right to direct the use of the asset.

For a lease with terms greater than a year, a right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability is recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The initial measurement of the operating lease ROU asset also includes any prepaid lease payments and are reduced by any previously accrued deferred rent. The Company’s operating lease does 
not
 provide a readily determinable implicit rate; therefore, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on the information available at commencement date (
7.2
%). The Company’s operating lease does 
not
 include a fixed rental escalation clause. Lease terms include optional renewal periods when it is reasonably certain that such options will be exercised. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. 
See Note 
3
.

Intangible and Long-Lived Assets

Intangible assets consist of acquired technology and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. The Company amortizes the cost of identifiable intangible assets on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which is estimated at 
three
 years, see
 Note 
3
.

Costs associated with internally developed software are expensed as incurred unless they meet generally accepted accounting criteria for deferral and subsequent amortization. Software development costs incurred prior to the application development stage are expensed as incurred. For costs that are capitalized, the subsequent amortization is the straight-line method over the remaining economic life of the product, which is estimated to be 
five
 years.

 and $

 of costs in the development of its software for continuing operations for the years ended 
 December 31, 2024 
and

, respectively.

The Company reviews the carrying value of its long-lived assets, including equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset 
 may 
not
 be recoverable from the estimate future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. In cases where undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset group, an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the asset group’s carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, the manner in which the property is used, and the effects of customer loss, obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors.

During the 
fourth
 quarter of 
2023,
 management determined the Company had experienced a triggering event due to receiving notification the Company’s largest Affiliate Marketing Services customer was in the process of leaving the European Poker Affiliate Solutions market, which would reduce future marketing commissions, The Company impaired the customer relationships intangible asset and software in development for Affiliate Marketing segment as a result of this information and impact on future cash flows. The impairment charge has been included in the Goodwill and intangible asset impairment expense line item in the consolidated statement operations for the year ended 
 December 31, 2023.

Goodwill and Impairment

The Company evaluates the carrying amount of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the goodwill 
 may 
be impaired. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or significant negative industry or economic trends. The Company completes impairment reviews for its reporting units using a fair-value method based on management’s judgments and assumptions. When performing its annual impairment assessment, the Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units by comparing the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit to the carrying value, including goodwill. The Company estimates fair value utilizing the income approach and the market approach or a combination of both income and market approaches.

The income approach requires management to make assumptions and estimates for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, working capital levels, income tax rates, and a weighted-average cost of capital reflecting the specific risk profile of the respective reporting unit. The key assumptions used in the income approach include revenue growth, operating income margin, discount rate and terminal growth rate. These assumptions are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment. Discount rates are determined by using market and industry data as well as Company-specific risk factors for each reporting unit. The discount rate utilized for each reporting unit is indicative of the return an investor would expect to receive for investing in such a business.

The market approach estimates fair value using performance multiples of comparable publicly traded companies. In the event the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting unit.

For the year ended 
 December 31, 2023, 
the Company recorded goodwill impairment of $
1,615,167
, which was due to the Company’s largest Affiliate Marketing Services customer announcing its intention in the 
fourth
 quarter of 
2023
 to leave the Company’s PAS network, which would reduce future marketing commissions. The extent of impairment was determined based upon the projected performance of the reporting unit, as determined using an income approach valuation methodology. Key assumptions included in the determination of the reporting unit’s fair value included revenue growth, operating margin, long-term growth rate and discount rate. There is 
no
 goodwill balance as of the year ended 
 December 31, 2024.

Convertible Debenture at Fair Value

The Company accounts for convertible debentures using an amortized cost model. The discount for warrants, the Original Issuance Discount (“OID”) and the initial allocation of fair value of compound derivatives reduce the initial carrying amount of the convertible notes. The carrying value is accredited to the stated principal amount at contractual maturity using the effective-interest method with a corresponding charge to interest expense. Debt discounts are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that related debt.

The Company made an irrevocable election at the time of issuance of the Debenture to record the Debenture at its fair value (the “Fair Value Option”) with changes in fair value recorded through the Company’s consolidated statements of operations within other income (expense) at each reporting period. The Fair Value Option provides the Company a measurement basis election for financial instruments on an instrument-by-instrument basis.

, the Company incurred $

Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based compensation expense reflects the fair value of stock-based awards measured at the grant date and recognized over the requisite service period. The Company estimates the fair value of each stock-based award on the measurement date using the Black-Scholes option valuation model which incorporates assumptions as to stock price volatility, the expected life of the options, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield.  For restricted stock awards, the Company records the value of the Company stock at the date of the grant as stock based compensation expense.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 
740,
 Income Taxes, under which deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities, net operating losses, and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

The Company uses a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. A tax position is recognized when it is more likely than 
not
 that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-
not
 recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 
50%
 likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority. The standard also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits, classification on the balance sheet, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.

Net Loss Per Share

Basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss available to ordinary shareholders, adjusted for preferred stock discount accretion and dividends accrued on preferred stock, by the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted net loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share, except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding if potential ordinary shares had been issued if such additional common shares were dilutive.

As the Company had a net loss from continuing operations and net income from discontinued operations for the year ended

Fair Value Measurements

The Company has determined the fair value of certain assets and liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which provides a framework for measuring fair value. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques should maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.

        F-

15

Table of Contents

A fair value hierarchy has been established, which prioritizes the valuation inputs into 
three
 broad levels. Level 
1
 inputs consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 
2
 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 
1
 that are observable for the related asset or liability. Level 
3
 inputs are unobservable inputs related to the asset or liability.

Estimates

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our most critical estimates include those related to use of accounting for revenue recognition, stock-based compensation, warrants
 and 
discontinued operations. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are 
not
 readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Contingencies

From time to time, we 
 may 
become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters 
 may 
arise from time to time that 
 may 
harm our business. Although we currently maintain liability insurance coverage intended to cover professional liability and certain other claims, we cannot assure that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising out of claims asserted against us in the future where the outcomes of such claims are unfavorable to us. Liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage, including coverage for professional liability and certain other claims, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

 - Going Concern

In the pursuit of SharpLink’s previous long-term growth strategy centered on the development of its fan activation and conversion software and related businesses, the Company has sustained continued operating losses. During the 
 12 months ended

 December 31, 2024 
and 
2023
, the Company had a net loss from continuing operations of $(
4,473,643
) and $(
11,248,598
), respectively; and cash (used)/provided by operating activities from continuing and discontinued operations of $(
22,814,486
) and $
582,887
 for the years ended 
 December 31, 2024 
and 
2023
, respectively.

On 
 January 18, 2024, 
the Company completed the Sale of Business of our Sports Gaming Client Services and SportsHub Gaming Network business units for $
22.5
 million in an all cash transaction. In connection with the closing of the Sale of Business, SharpLink repaid in full all outstanding term loans and lines of credit with Platinum Bank, together with accrued but unpaid interest and all other amounts due in connection with such repayment under existing credit agreements, totaling an aggregate $
14,836,625
 and thereby terminating all existing credit facilities with Platinum Bank and discharging the debt on the Company’s balance sheet.  See 
Note 
3
. In addition, the Company redeemed the outstanding convertible debenture issued to Alpha Capital Anstalt ("Alpha") for 
110
% of the outstanding balance, plus accrued and unpaid interest, $
4,484,230
 in aggregate, thereby satisfying all obligations under the debenture and discharging the debt on the balance sheet. See 
Note 
8
.

On 
 May 2, 2024, 
the Company entered into an At-The-Market ("ATM") Sales Agreement (the "ATM Sales Agreement”) with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (the "Agent”) pursuant to which the Company 
 may 
offer and sell, from time to time, through the Agent, as sales agent and/or principal, shares of its common stock, par value $
0.0001
 per share (the "Common Stock”), having an aggregate offering price of up to $
1,676,366
, subject to certain limitations on the amount of Common Stock that 
 may 
be offered and sold by the Company set forth in the ATM Sales Agreement (the "Offering”). The Company is 
not
 obligated to make any sales of Common Stock under the ATM Sales Agreement and any determination by the Company to do so will be dependent, among other things, on market conditions and the Company’s working capital needs. As of 
 December 31, 2024, 
SharpLink had raised gross proceeds of $
896,215
 from the sale of 
1,128,380
 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the ATM Sales Agreement.
 See Note 
9.

On 
 February 4, 2025,
 the Company filed a prospectus supplement that amended and supplemented the ATM Sales Agreement (see Note 
9
) and the information in the  prospectus supplement, dated 
 May 2, 2024, 
relating to the offer and sale of up to $
1,676,366
 of our shares of Common Stock, $
0.0001
 par value per share. The Company has sold 
2,843,902
 shares of Common Stock in accordance with the ATM Sales Agreement under the initial and supplemental prospectuses with total proceeds to the Company of $
1,834,925
.

We 
 may 
need to raise additional capital to fund the Company’s growth and future business operations. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are 
not
 able to secure additional funding when needed to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges, track and comply with applicable laws and regulations, develop new technology and services or enhance our existing offering, improve our operating infrastructure, enhance our information security systems to combat changing cyber threats and expand personnel to support our business, we 
 may 
have to delay or reduce the scope of planned strategic growth initiatives. Moreover, any additional equity financing that we obtain 
 may 
dilute the ownership held by our existing shareholders. The economic dilution to our shareholders will be significant if our stock price does 
not
 materially increase, or if the effective price of any sale is below the price paid by a particular shareholder. Any debt financing could involve substantial restrictions on activities and creditors could seek additional pledges of some or all of our assets. If we fail to obtain additional funding as needed, we 
 may 
be forced to cease or scale back operations, and our results, financial conditions and stock price would be adversely affected. As such, these factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period.

Sale of Sports Gaming Client Services and SportsHub Gaming Network

On 
 January 18, 2024, 
SharpLink Israel (“Parent Seller”) and 
SLG1
 Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of SharpLink (“Subsidiary Seller”), SHGN Acquisition Corp. (“SHGN,” and together with Parent Seller and Subsidiary Seller, the “Seller”), a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of SharpLink, entered into a Purchase Agreement (the “PA”) with RSports Interactive, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (“Buyer”). The Subsidiary Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Sports Technologies, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company, SHGN and Holdings Quinn, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (collectively referred to as the “Targets”). The PA contemplated the sale of the Company’s Sports Gaming Client Services and SportsHub Gaming Network business units to the Buyer, by selling all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of the Targets and the Acquired Subsidiaries for $
22,500,000
 in an all cash transaction. SHGN owns all of the membership interests in Virtual Fantasy Games Acquisitions, LLC , a Minnesota limited liability company; LeagueSafe Management, LLC , a Minnesota limited liability company; SportsHub Reserve, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company; SportsHub PA, LLC, a Pennsylvania limited liability company; SportsHub Operations, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company; SportsHub Holdings, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company; SportsHub Regulatory, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company; and SportsHub Player Reserve, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company (collectively, the “Acquired Subsidiaries”).

As a result of the Sale of Business, we ceased our Sports Game Client Services and SportsHub Gaming Network segments. The historical results of these business segments have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods prior to the closing date of the Sale of Business on 
 January 18, 2024. 

In connection with the Sale of Business, the Company entered into with the Buyer a Transition Services Agreement to provide for an orderly transfer and the continuity of business services. The Parent Seller would be able to use certain Buyer employees at an agreed upon hourly rate. The Buyer would be charged monthly amounts for business services such as accounting software, insurance and data services.

On 
 May 8, 2024, 
SharpLink entered into an amended and fully restated Post Closing Assignment Agreement with RSports, whereby SharpLink and RSports have agreed to amend the PA to exclude the transfer/sale of SHGN and have agreed to the assignment/sale of the Acquired Subsidiaries membership interests in SHReserve and SHPA to be made directly to RSports upon and subsequent to the approval of a petition by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. Based on this amended agreement, the sale of the business is an asset sale for legal and tax purposes instead of an equity sale.

Further, in connection with the Sale of Business, SharpLink entered into a Post Closing Covenant Agreement (the “PCCA”) with the Buyer defining the post-closing terms and conditions relating to certain transfers and assignments of assets subsequent to the closing of the Sale of Business, including:

●

Transferring control of all bank accounts held by the Targets to the Buyer;

●

Transferring or cooperating with the application process for all state gaming licenses held by the Targets in connection with the change of control to the Buyer;

●

Providing the Buyer with an accounting of all funds due to and from and any deferred revenue between Sports Technologies, LLC, SHGN and SharpLink, Inc.;

●

Assigning to Buyer or its affiliates, or cause the counterparty to consent to, all contracts assumed by the Buyer or its affiliates on or subsequent to the closing based upon change of control provisions; and

●

Assigning to Buyer or its affiliates all of its intellectual property rights purchased in the PA for the Acquired Subsidiaries or Targets.

In accordance with the terms of the PCCA, SharpLink will complete all post-closing covenants following the closing as reasonably possible, with the exception of Seller covenants that are dependent on governmental authorities or governmental orders for completion, in which case it will use diligent, good faith efforts to cause the same to be completed as soon as practical. The $
14.6
 million 
gain
 was calculated by measuring the difference between the fair value of consideration received less the carrying amount of assets and liabilities sold in accordance with ASC 
810.

In the statement of cashflows for the year ended 
 December 31, 2024, 
the net cash used in investing activities - discontinued operations is due to cash received from the sale of business of $
22,500,000
, net of the cash transferred of $
41,357,834
. The majority of the cash transferred of $
41,357,834
 was reflected in discontinued operations customer deposits liability and deferred revenue of $
36,959,573
 and $
4,888,704
, respectively.

During the year ended 
 December 31, 2024, 
SharpLink paid RSports $
157,857
, respectively, for use of accounting service personnel under the PCCA agreement. RSports paid SharpLink $
89,940

 - Convertible Debenture and Warrant

Convertible Debenture at Fair Value

The Company accounts for convertible debentures using an amortized cost model. The discount for warrants, the Original Issuance Discount (“OID”) and the initial allocation of fair value of compound derivatives reduce the initial carrying amount of the convertible notes. The carrying value is accredited to the stated principal amount at contractual maturity using the effective-interest method with a corresponding charge to interest expense. Debt discounts are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that related debt.

The Company made an irrevocable election at the time of issuance of the Debenture to record the Debenture at its fair value (the “Fair Value Option”) with changes in fair value recorded through the Company’s consolidated statements of operations within other income (expense) at each reporting period. The Fair Value Option provides the Company a measurement basis election for financial instruments on an instrument-by-instrument basis.

On 
 February 14, 2023, 
the Company entered into the SPA with Alpha, a current shareholder of the Company, pursuant to which the Company issued to Alpha, an 
8
% Interest Rate, 
10
% Original Issue Discount, Senior Convertible Debenture (the “Debenture”) in the aggregate principal amount of $
4,400,000
 for a purchase price of $
4,000,000
 on 
 February 15, 2023. 
The Debenture is convertible, at any time, and from time to time, at Alpha’s option, into ordinary shares of the Company (the “Conversion Shares”), at an initial conversion price equal to $
7.00
 per share, subject to adjustment as described below and, in the Debenture, (the “Conversion Price”). In addition, the Conversion Price of the Debenture was subject to an initial reset immediately prior to the Company’s filing of a registration statement covering the resale of the underlying shares to the lower of $
7.00
 and the average of the 
five
 Nasdaq Official Closing Prices immediately preceding such date (the “Reset Price”). The registration statement on Form S-
1
 (file 
No.:

333
-
271396
) was filed on 
 April 21, 2023, 
and as a result, the Reset Price is now $
4.1772
. The initial adjustment of the Conversion Price to the Reset Price had a floor price of $
3.00
 (the “Floor Price”).

Commencing 
 November 1, 2023 
and continuing on the 
first
 day of each month thereafter until the earlier of (i) 
 February 15, 2026 (
the “Maturity Date”) and (ii) the full redemption of the Debenture (each such date, a “Monthly Redemption Date”), the Company will redeem $
209,524
 plus accrued but unpaid interest, and any amounts then owing under the Debenture (the “Monthly Redemption Amount”). The Monthly Redemption Amount will be paid in cash; provided, that the Company 
 may 
elect to pay all or a portion of a Monthly Redemption Amount in ordinary shares of the Company, based on a conversion price equal to the lesser of (i) the then Conversion Price of the Debenture and (ii) 
80%
 of the average of the VWAPs (as defined in the Debenture) for the 
five
 consecutive trading days ending on the trading day that is immediately prior to the applicable Monthly Redemption Date. The Company 
 may 
also redeem some or all of the then outstanding principal amount of the Debenture at any time for cash in an amount equal to the then outstanding principal amount of the Debenture being redeemed plus accrued but unpaid interest, liquidated damages and any amounts then owing under the Debenture. These monthly redemption and optional redemptions are subject to the satisfaction of the Equity Conditions (as defined in the Debenture).

The Debenture initially accrues interest at the rate of 
8
% per annum for the 
first

12
 months from the 
 February 15, 2023, 
at the rate of 
10
% per annum for the ensuing 
12
 months, and thereafter until Maturity, at the rate of 
12
%, Interest 
 may 
be paid in cash or ordinary shares of the Company or a combination thereof at the option of the Company; provided that interest 
 may 
only be paid in shares if the Equity Conditions (as defined in the Debenture) have been satisfied, including Shareholder Approval. The Debenture includes a beneficial ownership blocker of 
9.99
%. The Debenture provides for adjustments to the Conversion Price in connection with stock dividends and splits, subsequent Sale of Business and rights offerings, pro rata distributions, and certain Fundamental Transactions. In the event the Company, at any time while the Debentures is outstanding, issues or grants any right to re-price, ordinary shares or any type of securities giving rights to obtain ordinary shares at a price below the Conversion Price, Alpha shall be extended full-ratchet anti-dilution protection (subject to customary Exempt Transaction issuances), and such reset shall 
not
 be limited by the Floor Price.

At the time of execution, on 
 February 14, 2023, 
the Company recorded an initial debt discount of $
400,000
 based on the allocation of fair value for the Debenture, which will be amortized into interest expense over term of the Debenture. For the period from 
 February 14, 2023 
through 
 December 31, 2023, 
the Company recognized $
1,230,234
 change in fair value of the convertible Debenture which is reflected in Other income and expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations and $
116,667
 for the amortization of the OID, which is included in interest expense on the condensed consolidated statement of operations.

Pursuant to Section 
8
(a)(vi) of the Debenture, it is an event of default if the Company is party to a fundamental transaction or agrees to sell or dispose of all or in excess of 
33
% of its assets in 
one
 transaction or a series of related transactions. On 
 January 19, 2024, 
SharpLink and Alpha entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) whereby Alpha agreed to waive (i) the event of default under Section 
8
(a)(vi) of the Debenture in connection with the Sale of Business; and (ii) payment of the Mandatory Default Amount; and the parties agreed that the Company would pay 
110
% of the outstanding principal amount of the Debenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest, in the aggregate total amount of $
4,484,230
 (the “Debenture Redemption Amount”). On 
 January 19, 2024, 
the Company paid Alpha the Debenture Redemption Amount. As a result, the Company’s obligations under the Debenture have been satisfied.

Purchase Warrant

On 
 February 15, 2023, 
the Company also issued to Alpha a warrant (the “Warrant”) to purchase 
880,000
 ordinary shares of the Company at an initial exercise price of $
8.75
 (the “Warrant Shares,” and, together with the Conversion Shares, and any other ordinary shares of the Company that 
 may 
otherwise become issuable pursuant to the terms of the Debenture and Warrant, the “Underlying Shares”). The Warrant is exercisable in whole or in part, at any time on or after 
 February 15, 2023 
and before 
 February 15, 2028. 
The exercise price of the Warrant was subject to an initial reset immediately prior to the Company’s filing of a proxy statement that included a shareholder proposal to approve the issuance of Underlying Share in excess of 
19.99
% of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares on the Closing Date (the “Shareholder Proposal”) to the lower of $
8.75
 and the average of the 
five
 Nasdaq Official Closing Prices immediately preceding such date the. As a result, the exercise price has been reset to $
4.0704
, the average of the 
five
 Nasdaq Official Closing Prices immediately preceding 
 April 14, 2023, 
the date the Company filed its preliminary proxy statement which included the Shareholder Proposal. The Warrant includes a beneficial ownership blocker of 
9.99
%. The Warrant provides for adjustments to the exercise price, in connection with stock dividends and splits, subsequent Sale of Business and rights offerings, pro rata distributions, and certain Fundamental Transactions.

In the event the Company, at any time while the Warrant is still outstanding, issues or grants any right to re-price, ordinary shares or any type of securities giving rights to obtain ordinary shares at a price below exercise price, Alpha shall be extended full-ratchet anti-dilution protection on the Warrant (reduction in price, only, 
no
 increase in number of Warrant Shares, and subject to customary Exempt Transaction issuances), and such reset shall 
not
 be limited by the Floor Price.

At the time of execution, the Company classified the Warrant as an equity contract and performed an initial fair value measurement. As the Warrant was issued with the sale of the Debenture, the value assigned to the Warrant was based on an allocation of proceeds, subject to the allocation to the Debenture. The Company recorded a debt discount for the Warrant of $
1,174,229
, based on the Black Scholes option-pricing model which was calculated independently of the fair value of the Debenture, and recorded the Warrant as additional paid in capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of 
 December 31, 2023. 
Amortization of the debt discount amounted to $
342,482
 for the period ended 
 December 31, 2023 
and is included in interest expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

The Warrant provides that in the event of a fundamental transaction, SharpLink, at Alpha’s option, would repurchase the Warrant from Alpha on the terms set forth in Section 
3
(e)(ii) of the 
2023
 Warrant (the “Warrant Repurchase”). On 
 January 19, 2024, 
SharpLink and Alpha entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) whereby Alpha agreed to waive (i) the event of default under Section 
3
(e)(ii) of the Warrant in connection with the Sale of Business

Pursuant to Section 
5
(
1
) of the Warrant, Alpha further agreed to waive its right to elect that, in connection with and at the closing of the Sale of Business, the Warrant shall be repurchased by the Company as set forth in Section 
3
(e) of the 
2023
 Warrant. The Parties agreed in the Settlement Agreement that the Warrant Repurchase for its Black Scholes value shall take place upon the earlier of (a) 
 June 30, 2024; (
b) the Company raising a gross amount of 
not
 less than $
3,000,000
 whether by equity or debt; and (c) the Company entering into a “fundamental transaction” as defined in the 
2023
 Warrant. The Parties further agree in the Settlement Agreement to fix the Black Scholes value of the 
2023
 Warrant for purposes of the Warrant Repurchase at $
900,000
.

On 
 March 6, 2024, 
SharpLink entered into an Exchange Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Alpha to change the Warrant Repurchase of $
900,000
. Pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to exchange the 
2023
 Warrant for (i) 
156,207
 shares of Common Stock (the “Shares”), (ii)a pre-funded warrant in the amount of 
469,560
 shares of Common Stock (the “Pre-Funded Warrant”) and (iii) the unexchanged balance of the 
2023
 Warrant Repurchase (the “Warrant Repurchase Balance”). The Warrant Repurchase Balance of 
254,233
 warrants is valued at $
170,636
 and shall be subject to the repurchase terms set forth in the Settlement Agreement. The Pre-Funded Warrant and the Warrant Repurchase Balance were valued using Black Scholes option-pricing model. As part of this transaction, the Company recorded a deemed dividend of $
44,619
 as presented in the statement of stockholders’ equity for the year ended 
 December 31, 2024.

On 
 June 30, 2024

 SharpLink negotiated an Amendment to the Exchange Agreement (the "Amendment") to reduce the strike price per warrant of the unexchanged balance of the 
2023
 Warrants Repurchase Balance from $
4.07

0.0001
 and to remove the re-purchase option. The modification to the Exchange Agreement was valued on 
 June 29, 2024, 
the day before the modification, using the Black Scholes option-pricing model.  The Company recorded a fair value adjustment of 
$17,996﻿
 on the condensed consolidated statements of operations during the 
second
 quarter of 
2024
 and removed the remaining accrued warrant liability of $
152,386

The fair value of the Debenture was determined using a Monte Carlo Simulation (“MCS”) which incorporates the probability and timing of the consummation of a Fundamental Transaction event and conversion of the Debenture as of the valuation date.

The MCS implied a discount rate at issuance that resulted in a total value to the debenture and warrants that equated to the transaction proceeds. This discount rate was 
50.0%
 at issuance and was calibrated to the 
 December 31, 2023 
valuation date by comparing the B rated commercial paper credit spread at both dates. B spreads as follows:

 - Stock Compensation

Equity awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s Ordinary shares at the date of grant; those options generally vest based on 
three
 years of continuous service and have 
ten
-year contractual terms. Certain option and share awards provide for accelerated vesting if there is a change in control, as defined in the plans.

The Company granted 
0
 and 
155,755
 options for the year ended 
 December 31, 2024 
and 
2023
, respectively.  The Company granted 
500,004
 and 
0
 restricted stock units for the year ended 
 December 31, 2024 
and 
2023,
 respectively.  The Company recognized stock compensation expense of $
160,565
 and $
634,367
 for the years ended 
 December 31, 2024 
and 
2023
, respectively, of which $
12,041
 and $
372,994
 of expense are recorded in discontinued operations.

The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black Scholes option-pricing model. The Company uses historical option exercise and termination data to estimate the term the options are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The expected dividend yield is calculated using historical dividend amounts and the stock price at the option issue date. The expected volatility is determined using the volatility of peer companies. The Company’s underlying stock has been publicly traded since the date of the MTS Merger. Subsequent to the MTS Merger, option grants made under the SharpLink Inc. 
2021
 Plan utilized the publicly traded stock price of the Company on the day of the option award. All option grants made under the SharpLink, Inc. 
2020
 Stock Incentive Plan were prior to the MTS Merger. The underlying SharpLink, Inc. stock under that plan was 
not
 publicly traded but was estimated on the date of the grants using valuation methods that consider valuations from recent equity financings as well as future planned transactions. All option grants made under the SportsHub Games Network Inc. 
2018
 Incentive Plan were prior to the SportsHub Acquisition. The underlying SportsHub stock under that plan was 
not
 publicly traded but was estimated on the date of the grants using valuation methods that consider valuations from recent equity financings as well as future planned transactions.

Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 
30
 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, the Company has determined that its contracts generally do 
not
 include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing the Company’s products and services, and 
not
 to facilitate financing arrangements.

As of 
 December 31, 2024
, the Company maintained a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets to reduce the total to an amount management believed was appropriate. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon sufficient future taxable income during the periods when deductible temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be available to reduce taxable income.

As of 
 December 31, 2024
, the Company has a federal tax net operating loss carryforward of $
21,832,273
, which will be available to offset future taxable income indefinitely. The Company has net operating loss carryforwards in various states. The net tax effected value of those state net operating loss carryforwards is $
6,150,701
 in various states. The state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 
2034
 and are available to offset future taxable income or reduce taxes payable through 
2045.
 The Company also has net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions of approximately $
41,100,000
 that are reported in discontinued operations. The Company’s ability to utilize these net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
 may 
be subject to certain limitations.

The foreign net operating losses related to operations in Israel and Hong Kong can be carried forward indefinitely. The Company has US federal and state research and development tax credits of $
26,818
 as of 
 December 31, 2024
, that will be available to offset future tax liabilities. Research and development tax credits will begin to expire in

The Company has 
not
 provided any additional U.S. federal or state income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed foreign earnings or basis differences as such differences have been considered indefinitely reinvested in the business. The determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings is 
not
 practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, Minnesota, and various other states. The Company is 
not
 subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 
2018.
 The Company also files in Israel, Hong Kong and other foreign jurisdictions. The Company is 
not
 subject to audit in periods prior to 
2018
 in Israel and 
2016,
 in Hong Kong The other foreign jurisdictions have various tax examination periods.

We follow the authoritative guidance on accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in tax positions which requires us to determine whether a tax position of the Company is more likely than 
not
 to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals of litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions meeting the more likely than 
not
 threshold, the uncertain tax benefit amount recognized in the financial statements is reduced to the largest benefit that has a greater than 
50%
 likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included in the provision for income taxes in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. In accordance with the Discontinued Operations - Sale of Sports Gaming Client Services and SportsHub Gaming Network (See Note 
3
), management performed an evaluation of the technical merits of the Israeli Controlled Foreign Corporate Rules to determine the taxability of the gain from the Sale of Business from an Israeli tax perspective. This analysis also considered the results of the U.S. income tax. Management determined that the technical merits for uncertain tax exposure resulting from the gain for Israeli tax purposes did 
not
 exceed the more-likely-than-
not
 threshold and has 
not
 recorded any income tax liability at 
 December 31, 2024. 
Management’s determination is based on known facts and circumstances and requires judgment of a complex set of rules and regulations. If facts and circumstances change, such as closing, liquidating or selling of the businesses’ equity that is remaining, including events outside the Company’s control, this could have a material impact on the management’s determination.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as additional income tax expense. During the years ended 
 December 31, 2024 
and 
2023
, the Company did 
not
 recognize material income tax expense related to interest and penalties. The Company’s uncertain tax position balance from continuing operations was $
0
 at 
 December 31, 2024
.

Regaining Compliance with Nasdaq Continued Listing Standards

As previously reported on Form 
10
-Q filed by the Company on 
 August 15, 2024, 
the Company received a letter on 
 July 17, 2024, 
from Nasdaq notifying the Company that, because the closing bid price for its common stock had been below 
$1.00
 per share for 
30
 consecutive trading days, it was 
not
 compliant with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement (the “Bid Price Deficiency Notice”). In accordance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 
5810
(c)(
3
)(A), the Company had a period of 
180
 calendar days, or until 
 January 7, 2025, 
to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.  Further, as previously reported on our Current Report on Form 
8
-K filed on 
 November 22, 2024, 
the Nasdaq Staff notified the Company that it did 
not
 comply with the 
$2.5
 million minimum stockholders’ equity requirement, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 
5550
(a)(
2
). The Company had 
45
 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance or until 
 January 6, 2025.

On 
 January 8, 2025, 
SharpLink received a letter (the “Notice”) from the Listing Qualifications Department of the Nasdaq indicating the Company’s continued non-compliance with Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 
5550
(a)(
2
) (the “Bid Price Rule”). The Notice from the Staff informed the Company that the Staff had determined that the Company has 
not
 regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and was 
not
 eligible for a 
second

180
-day compliance period, due to the Company’s previously reported failure to comply with the 
$5,000,000
 minimum stockholders’ equity requirement for initial listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market as required under Listing Rule 
5505
(b)(
1
).  

The Company had a hearing with the Nasdaq Hearing Panel on 
 February 25, 2025. 
The Company’s Common Stock will remain listed and eligible for trading on Nasdaq pending the ultimate conclusion of the hearing process. 

SharpLink is working to evidence compliance with Minimum Bid Price Requirement and Minimum Stockholder’s Equity Requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and intends to submit a plan to that effect to the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) as part of the hearing process; however, there can be 
no
 assurance the Panel will grant any request for continued listing or that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the applicable listing criteria within the period of time that 
 may 
be granted by the Panel.
