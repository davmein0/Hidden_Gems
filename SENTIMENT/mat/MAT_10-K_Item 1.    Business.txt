International Segment
Products marketed and sold by the International segment are generally the same as those marketed and sold by the North America segment, although some are developed or adapted for particular international markets. Mattel's products are sold directly to retailers and wholesalers in most European, Latin American, and Asian countries, in Australia and New Zealand, and through agents and distributors in those countries where Mattel has no direct presence. No individual country within the International segment exceeded 7% of worldwide consolidated net sales during 2024.
Competition and Industry Background
Mattel is a worldwide leader in the manufacture, marketing, and sale of toys, games, and other products related to play, entertainment, learning, and development. Competition in the toy industry is based primarily on quality, play value, brands, and price. Mattel offers a wide range of products for children, fans of all ages, and families that include, among others, toys for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, toys for school-aged children, dolls, vehicles, action figures, building sets, games, including digital, puzzles, plush, educational toys, technology-related products, media-driven products, and fashion-related items. The North America segment competes with several large toy companies, including Hasbro, Jazwares, LEGO, the Pokémon Company, Spin Master, many smaller toy companies, and manufacturers of digital games and consumer electronics. The North America segment also includes 
American Girl
 products which compete with companies that manufacture dolls and accessories, and with children's book publishers and retailers. The International segment competes with global toy companies including Hasbro, Jazwares, LEGO, the Pokémon Company, Spin Master, other national and regional toy companies, and manufacturers of digital games and consumer electronics. Foreign regions may include competitors that are strong in a particular toy line or geographical area but do not compete with Mattel or other international toy companies worldwide.
There is increasing competition among the above companies due to trends towards shorter life cycles for individual toy products, the phenomenon of children outgrowing toys at younger ages, an increasing use of more sophisticated technology in toys, including machine learning and artificial intelligence ("AI"), and an evolving path to purchase for consumers. In addition, Mattel competes with companies that sell non-toy products, such as electronic consumer products, digital games, as well as content and other entertainment companies. Competition continues to be heavily influenced by the fact that a small number of retailers account for a large portion of all toy sales, allocate the shelf space from which toys are viewed, and have direct contact with parents and children through in-store and online purchases. Such retailers can and do promote their own private-label toys, facilitate the sale of competitors' toys, showcase toys online based on proprietary algorithms, and allocate shelf space to one type of toy over another. Online distributors are able to promote a wide variety of toys and represent a wide variety of toy manufacturers.
Seasonality
Mattel's business is highly seasonal, with consumers making a large percentage of all toy purchases during the traditional holiday season. A significant portion of retailer purchasing typically occurs in the third and fourth quarters of the year in anticipation of holiday buying. These seasonal purchasing patterns and requisite production lead times create risk to Mattel's business associated with the underproduction of popular toys and the overproduction of less popular toys that do not match consumer demand. The seasonality of Mattel's business increases the risk that Mattel may not be able to meet demand for certain products at peak demand times or that Mattel's own inventory levels may be adversely impacted by the need to pre-build products before orders are placed. In addition, this seasonality may cause Mattel's sales to vary significantly from period to period.
In anticipation of retail sales during the traditional holiday season, Mattel significantly increases its production in advance of the peak selling period, resulting in a corresponding build-up of inventory levels in the first three quarters of the year. Additionally, seasonal shipping patterns generally result in significant increases in accounts receivable during the third and fourth quarters of the year. The elevated accounts receivable and inventory levels may result in seasonal working capital financing requirements. 
6
Sales
Mattel's products are sold throughout the world. Products within the North America segment include products sold directly to retailers, including omnichannel retailers, discount and free-standing toy stores, chain stores, department stores, other retail outlets, and, to a limited extent, wholesalers. Mattel also operates small retail outlets at certain corporate offices as a service to its employees and as an outlet for its products. The North America segment also includes 
American Girl
 products and its children's publications, which are sold directly to consumers and select retailers in the United States. Mattel has retail space in Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; and New York, New York for its flagship 
American Girl 
stores, and in four other cities across the United States for its 
American Girl 
boutique stores. Products within the International segment are sold directly to retailers and wholesalers in most European, Latin American, and Asian countries, in Australia and New Zealand, and through agents and distributors in those countries where Mattel has no direct presence. Mattel also has retail outlets in Latin America that serve as outlets for its products. Additionally, Mattel sells certain of its products directly to consumers through its e-commerce platform and various third-party e-commerce channels.
During 2024, Mattel's three largest customers (Walmart at $1.17 billion, Target at $0.68 billion, and Amazon at $0.51 billion) accounted for approximately 44% of worldwide consolidated net sales. During 2023, Mattel's three largest customers (Walmart at $1.13 billion, Target at $0.67 billion, and Amazon at $0.60 billion) accounted for approximately 44% of worldwide consolidated net sales. Within countries in the International segment, there is also a concentration of sales to certain large customers that do not operate in the United States, none of which exceeded 10% of worldwide consolidated net sales. The customers and the degree of concentration vary depending upon the region or nation. See Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" and Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Segment Information."
License Agreements
Mattel has license agreements with third parties that permit Mattel to utilize the trademark, characters, or inventions of the licensor in products that Mattel sells. A number of these licenses relate to product lines that are significant to Mattel's business and operations.
Mattel has entered into agreements to license entertainment properties, including among others, Disney Consumer Products (including
 Disney Princess
 and 
Disney Frozen, Star Wars, Disney Pixar
 (including 
Cars
 and 
Toy Story
) and certain other 
Disney
 films and television properties), NBCUniversal (including
 Jurassic World, Wicked,
 and
 Fast and Furious
), Warner Bros. (including 
DC Universe 
and
 Harry Potter
), 
Microsoft 
(including 
Minecraft 
and 
Halo
), 
WWE, Pokémon, 
and Paramount (relating to its 
Nickelodeon
 properties).
Royalty expense for 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $244.1 million, $249.8 million, and $230.8 million, respectively. See Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Commitments" and Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Commitments and Contingencies."
Mattel licenses a number of its trademarks and other property rights to others for use in connection with the sale of their products. 
Trademarks, Copyrights, and Patents
Most of Mattel's products are sold under and are associated with trademarks, trade names, and copyrights, and some of these products incorporate devices or designs for which patent protection has been, or is being, pursued. Trademarks, copyrights, and patents are significant assets of Mattel in that they provide product recognition, acceptance, and exclusive rights to Mattel's innovations around the world.
Mattel customarily seeks trademark, copyright, and/or patent protection covering its products, and it owns or has applications pending or registrations for U.S. and foreign trademarks, copyrights, and patents covering many of its products. Although a number of these trademarks, copyrights, and patents relate to product lines that are significant to Mattel's business and operations, Mattel does not believe it is dependent on a single trademark, copyright, or patent. Mattel believes its rights to these properties are adequately protected, but there can be no assurance that its rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged.
7
Manufacturing and Materials
Mattel manufactures toy products for all segments in both company-owned facilities and through third-party manufacturers. Products are also purchased from unrelated entities that design, develop, and manufacture those products. To provide greater flexibility in the manufacture and delivery of its products, and as part of a continuing effort to reduce manufacturing costs, Mattel has concentrated production of most of its core products in company-owned facilities and generally uses third-party manufacturers for the production of non-core products.
Mattel's principal manufacturing facilities are located in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, and Thailand. In conjunction with Mattel's cost savings programs, Mattel discontinued production at a plant located in China in 2024 and intends to discontinue production at another plant located in China in 2025. To help avoid disruption of its product supply due to political instability, civil unrest, future pandemics or other health crises, economic instability, changes in government policies or regulations, including tariffs, trade restrictions, or trade barriers, natural and manmade disasters, and other risks, Mattel produces its products in various facilities across multiple countries. Mattel believes that the existing production capacity at its owned and third-party manufacturers' facilities is sufficient to handle expected volume for the foreseeable future.
Mattel bases its production schedules for toy products on customer orders and forecasts, taking into account historical trends, results of market research, and current market information. Actual shipments of products ordered and order cancellation rates are affected by consumer acceptance of product lines, strength of competing products, marketing strategies of retailers, changes in buying patterns of both retailers and consumers, and overall economic conditions. Unexpected changes in these factors could result in a lack of product availability or excess inventory in a particular product line. 
The majority of Mattel's raw materials are available from numerous suppliers but may be subject to fluctuations in price. See Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors."
Advertising and Promotion
Mattel supports its product lines with extensive advertising and consumer promotions. Advertising takes place at varying levels throughout the year and peaks during the traditional holiday season. Advertising includes television commercials, social media, catalogs, and internet advertisements. Promotions include in-store displays, merchandising materials, major events focusing on products, and tie-ins with various consumer products companies.
During 2024, 2023, and 2022, Mattel incurred advertising and promotion expenses of $507.3 million (9.4% of net sales), $524.8 million (9.6% of net sales), and $534.3 million (9.8% of net sales), respectively.
Financial Instruments
Currency exchange rate fluctuations may impact Mattel's results of operations and cash flows. Mattel seeks to mitigate its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk by monitoring its foreign currency transaction exposure for the year and partially hedging such exposure using foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily to hedge its purchase and sale of inventory and other intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts have maturity dates of up to 24 months. In addition, Mattel manages its exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations through the selection of currencies used for international borrowings. Mattel does not trade in financial instruments for speculative purposes.
For additional information regarding foreign currency contracts, see Part II, Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Derivative Instruments."
Government Regulations
Mattel's products sold in the United States are subject to the provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act, as amended by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, and the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and may also be subject to the requirements of the Flammable Fabrics Act or the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act and the regulations promulgated pursuant to such statutes. These statutes and the related regulations ban from the market consumer products that fail to comply with applicable product safety laws, regulations, and standards. The Consumer Product Safety Commission may require the recall, repurchase, replacement, or repair of any such banned products or products that otherwise create a substantial risk of injury and may seek penalties for regulatory noncompliance under certain circumstances. Similar laws exist in some U.S. states. Mattel believes that it is in substantial compliance with these federal and state laws and regulations.
8
Mattel's products sold worldwide are subject to the provisions of similar laws and regulations in many jurisdictions, including the European Union ("EU") and Canada. Mattel believes that it is in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations.
Mattel maintains a quality control program to help ensure compliance with applicable product safety requirements. Nonetheless, Mattel has experienced, and may in the future experience, issues in products that result in recalls, withdrawals, or replacements of products. A product recall could have a material adverse effect on Mattel's business, financial condition, and results of operations, depending on the product affected by the recall and the extent of the recall efforts required. A product recall could also negatively affect Mattel's reputation and the sales of other Mattel products. See Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors."
Mattel's advertising and promotion activities are subject to the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Children's Television Act of 1990 and may also be subject to other rules and regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission, as well as laws of certain countries that regulate advertising, advertising to children, and related activities. In addition, Mattel's web-based products and services and other online and digital communications activity are or may be subject to U.S. and foreign privacy-related regulations, including the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and the EU General Data Protection Regulation and related national regulations. Privacy-related laws also exist in some U.S. states, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act, and other state laws that are in effect, or are yet to take effect. Mattel believes that it is in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations.
Mattel's worldwide operations are subject to the requirements of various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where those operations are located. Mattel believes that it is in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations. Mattel's operations are from time to time the subject of investigations, conferences, discussions, and negotiations with various federal, state, and local environmental agencies within and outside the United States with respect to the discharge or cleanup of hazardous waste. Mattel is not aware of any material cleanup liabilities. In addition, Mattel continues to monitor existing and pending environmental laws and regulations within the United States and elsewhere related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. 
Mattel is subject to various other federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations applicable to its business. Mattel believes that it is in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2024, Mattel had approximately 34,000 employees (including temporary and seasonal employees) working in over 37 countries worldwide to create innovative products and experiences that inspire fans, entertain audiences, and develop children through play. Approximately 29,600 employees (86% of the total workforce) are located outside the United States, with a significant global manufacturing labor workforce of approximately 25,100 employees. The remaining workforce focuses on design, marketing, sales, finance, and other aspects of Mattel's business.
Mattel believes recruiting, developing, and motivating a talented global workforce are important to its long-term growth and success. Through Mattel's focus on employee engagement, equal employment opportunity, training and development, health and safety, and employee well-being, Mattel endeavors to create a supportive and rewarding environment where employees are encouraged to collaborate, innovate, and grow. Mattel's Board of Directors, Compensation Committee, and Governance and Social Responsibility Committee are involved in the oversight of how the company fosters its culture and receive regular updates on Mattel's workforce management.
Mattel was ranked among Forbes 2024 World's Best Employers; named to Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies of 2024 and Best Workplaces for Innovators in 2024; recognized by Newsweek as one of the World's Most Trustworthy Companies of 2024; honored by TIME as one of America's Best Mid-Size Companies of 2024; named to Computerworld's 2024 Best Places to Work in IT; and certified as a Great Place to Work in multiple countries.
Workplace Culture
Mattel is committed to fostering a culture where all employees have the opportunity to realize their full potential. Management regularly collects feedback to measure employee engagement and job satisfaction on an ongoing basis through its annual global engagement survey, which is used to help improve the employee experience and strengthen its workplace culture. Mattel values a wide range of ideas and voices that help evolve and broaden its perspectives, with a reach that extends to consumers, customers, business partners, and suppliers.

Employee Development and Well-Being
Mattel believes continuously developing skills and capabilities for the future is essential to operating as an IP-driven, high-performing toy and family entertainment company. Additionally, offering the opportunity for employees to continuously learn and grow their careers at Mattel is a key driver of its employee engagement strategy. Around the globe, employees at all levels participate in a variety of online classes and instructor-led training, including professional development, management development, and technical training.
Mattel is focused on creating a safe and healthy workplace for all of its employees. This is reflected in a comprehensive set of standards and oversight processes that establish Mattel's expectations for responsible working conditions, environmental protections, social compliance, health, and safety in both its own manufacturing facilities and those of its supply chain partners.
Mattel offers several benefits to promote employee well-being, including paid time off, health and welfare insurance options, retirement plans, and basic and supplemental employee life insurance for eligible individuals.
